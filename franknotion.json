One of them was the world’s 8 billionth person. There weren’t any brightly wrapped packages or confetti, but the United Nations commemorated Nov. 15, 2022, as the “Day of 8 Billion.” Its #8BillionStrong campaign celebrated the world’s progress and highlighted how and where the population is growing — and what that growth will look like in the coming years. The U.N. attributed the world’s unprecedented growth to the gradual increase in human lifespan thanks to improvements in public health, nutrition, personal hygiene and medicine, as well as high and persistent levels of fertility in some countries. The Day of 8 Billion was underscored, however, by very real concerns about how to simultaneously provide nutrition for the expanding population while lowering environmental impact and replenishing the planet’s natural resources. Population growth is slowing. It took 12 years for the population to grow from 7 to 8 billion, and it will take 15 years for it to reach 9 billion. However, the growth has become increasingly concentrated among the world’s poorest countries, many of which are in sub-Saharan Africa, where the population is expected to hit 3.44 billion by the late 2060s. In these countries, sustained rapid population growth can thwart the achievement of the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the U.N. said. There’s also rapid growth in Asia. India and China each have more than 1.4 billion residents — that’s 35% of the world’s population. Next year, India is expected to surpass China as the world’s most populous country. “The (8 billion) milestone is an occasion to celebrate diversity and advancements while considering humanity’s shared responsibility for the planet,” said Antonio Guterres, United Nations Secretary-General. That responsibility was also the focus of the COP27 climate summit in Egypt, which coincided with the Day of 8 Billion. The 12-day conference, which ended Friday, brought together leaders from across the globe to discuss and deliver action on a myriad of climate-related challenges, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions, building resilience and adapting to impacts of climate change. One of this year’s goals was to renew solidarity between countries to deliver on the landmark Paris Agreement, a legally binding international treaty on climate change that was adopted at COP21 in 2016. Agriculture and food systems took center stage at this year’s climate talks, as a groundbreaking new initiative was announced that recognizes the relationship between nutrition and the climate crisis. The Initiative on Climate Action and Nutrition (I-CAN) will accelerate transformative action to address the critical nexus of climate change and nutrition. I-CAN will focus on policies and actions that work to reduce climate change and improve nutrition, particularly for children and vulnerable groups. COP27 also saw the launch of the Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation (FAST) initiative, which aims to implement concrete actions that would result in improving the quantity and quality of climate finance contributions to transform agriculture and food systems by 2030. A look at the trends The #8BillionStrong campaign identified eight trends for a world of 8 billion people: slowing growth, fewer children, longer lives, people on the move, aging populations, women outliving men, two pandemics and shifting centers. Growth rates vary across the globe: The data showed that regions of the world are growing at different rates, shifting the geographical distribution of the global population. The 46 least-developed countries are among the world’s fastest growing. Many are projected to double in population between 2022 and 2050, putting additional pressures on resources, the U.N. said. Shrinking populations: The annual population growth rate was 0.8% in 2022, compared to 2.3% in 1963. China’s population is no longer growing and may start declining by next year. More and more countries have shrinking populations because of decades of low fertility and high rates of emigration in some cases. Seventeen countries in Eastern Europe have seen their populations shrink since 1990. We’ll hit 9 billion in 15 years: Despite slowed growth in some countries, the world’s population is predicted to grow to around 8.5 billion by 2030, according to the U.N.’s predictions, and to 9 billion by 2037. It will be 9.7 billion by 2050 and 10.4 billion by 2100. We’re aging faster: By 2050, the number of people aged 65+ will be over twice the number of children under 5, and about the same as the number of children under 12. Global life expectancy at birth in 2019 was 72.8 years, up almost nine years since 1990. It is projected to rise to 77.2 years by 2050. We’re living longer: Life expectancy can be as high as 85 in Australia, Hong Kong and Japan, but it is much lower in low-income countries: 63. Life expectancy can be as low as 54 for those born in the Central African Republic, Chad, Lesotho or Nigeria. The impact of economic development: Rising per capita incomes — typically in areas where the population is not growing as rapidly — are the main driver of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption. Curbing those patterns will be critical to meeting the objectives of the Paris Agreement and achieving the SDGs, the U.N. said. These population predictions emphasize the important role of the agriculture industry as it works to ensure sustainable nutrition for the growing global population. Currently, more than 800 million people across the world still go to bed hungry each night, stunting the growth of both children and economies. The U.N. said the world’s food systems must transform to feed a growing population and limit environmental damage. “While population growth is a key driver of the increasing demand for food, changes in the amount and types of food consumed also play a major role. Food systems need to incorporate more sustainable practices while ensuring access to safe, sufficient, affordable and nutritious food and the enjoyment of a diversified, balanced and healthy diet for all,” the U.N. said. Alltech, a global leader in the agriculture industry, believes that agriculture has the greatest potential to positively shape the future of the planet. It is uniting the agrifood community in Working Together for a Planet of Plenty™. “To be sustainable, we must do much more than indefinitely maintain the status quo — true sustainability is continuous economic, environmental and social progress. Agriculture is uniquely positioned to support these critical pillars of sustainability, from providing nutrition for all and revitalizing local economies to replenishing the planet’s natural resources,” Alltech said.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/nourishing-world-8-billion-people-and-counting","title":"\n\n                    Nourishing the world: 8 billion people and counting\n                    ","date":"November 19, 2022","contentLength":1117}},{"pageContent":"The presence of mycotoxins in your pig herd’s feed regimen may result in unintended consequences. These toxic substances, produced by the fungi in feedstuffs, not only have the power to negatively influence growth and performance but can also suppress long-term reproductive performance. These symptoms are not the only issues that producers may see manifest in their animals as a result of a mycotoxin problem; feed refusals, swollen vulvas in gilts and sows, and the reduced effectiveness of treatments and vaccines can also become a threat to any operation. The Alltech 2022 U.S. Harvest Analysis is an extensive analysis of the mycotoxin risk across the country, as assessed by Alltech’s in-house mycotoxin expert, Dr. Max Hawkins. This report utilizes samples collected from throughout the country that have been analyzed through Alltech’s trusted 37+® mycotoxin analysis. Outlined below are the key takeaways from the 2022 U.S. Harvest Analysis, as well as several proactive tips that can help pig producers mitigate their mycotoxin risk. Here are five insights into the mycotoxin risk for the 2022 corn crop: 1. Responses to changing weather conditions The 2022 growing season brought with it a 180-degree difference in the challenges producers faced in various regions. Drought conditions in the midwestern United States had a significant impact on corn health and yield across the western corn belt. More severe drought conditions were detected by the drought monitor in the West, and these conditions extended eastward into Illinois, Indiana and part of Ohio. Rains in late July and August eased the drought conditions east of the Mississippi River, but this rainfall — on top of already-drought-stressed corn — spurred the growth of Fusarium molds, producing a variety of type-B trichothecenes, fumonisin and zearalenone. 2. Average mycotoxin samples found 119 samples had an average of 6.7 mycotoxins per sample 98% of the samples contained two or more mycotoxins All samples contained between one and 12 mycotoxins each Fusarium-produced mycotoxins were the most frequently occurring due to their preference for moist environments and moderate temperatures. The mycotoxins found most commonly in the samples included: Emerging mycotoxins (97.48%) Fusaric acid (83%) Type-B trichothecenes (68%) Fumonisin (65%) Zearalenone (35%) 3. Areas of greatest risk The mycotoxins produced by molds that represented the greatest risk were type-B trichothecenes, also known as the DON family, and zearalenone. Type-B trichothecenes can negatively impact feed intake, digestion, average daily gains, feed efficiency, gut wall integrity, liver function and immune system responses. Zearalenone can act synergistically with DON to magnify the risks for reproduction, the number of pigs born, the return to estrus and conception rates. Even when the presence of these mycotoxins is lowered by the corn inclusion rate, they still represent a high risk in the finished feed. 4. Geographical location and storage differences When it comes to Fusarium mycotoxins, the risk level tends to increase as we move from West to East. However, one factor that could increase the risk in the West is storage. Corn needs to be dried to a moisture level of 14% or less to be safely stored for extended periods of time. Across the Midwest, winter weather led to periods of cold temperatures, but in general, temperatures were above what is generally considered normal. These warmer temperatures — along with grain that was inadequately dried or left exposed to moisture — increase the likelihood of mold production and, as a result, mycotoxin growth. 5. Impact on the swine industry The 2022 corn crop does have ranging levels of risk depending on the location of the pigs and production settings nationwide. Differing storage types could provide an environment in which the risk at harvest could increase over time. This necessitates the need for the corn to be analyzed to determine its mycotoxin levels and risk as we move through the winter and spring of 2023. Proactive tips to help pig producers mitigate their mycotoxin risk Make sure your feed mill is checked often. When it comes to mycotoxins in pig feed, conducting proper testing allows for any potential risks to be managed. Dr. Hawkins shared that utilizing a mycotoxin testing program that is based on an instrument — such as HPLC MS/MS — will provide you with the most accurate and comprehensive analysis available. Furthermore, starting the analysis of your raw materials as close to harvest as possible will ensure that you have enough time to develop an all-encompassing risk management and mitigation plan. If this analysis is properly scheduled, then your operation will have a good understanding of the risk posed by the feedstuffs being provided to your pigs prior to the animals actually receiving it. “After utilizing comprehensive testing at harvest, you may then set up a quick analysis that can be used at your farm or mill,” said Dr. Hawkins in the U.S. Harvest Analysis webinar. “We would also suggest that you do more testing at various times throughout the year to ensure that your quick-test protocol for your grain or pig feed is still a solid plan for the production system.” Keep feed bins dry. Make sure your feed bins are closed and that there are no potential points of entry where moisture could get into the feedstuffs at the top of the silos. In the summer months, feed tanks or feed bins can get very hot and are prone to sweating. Ensure that feed gets moving through the tanks or bins quickly. If there is feed leftover, transfer it to another barn. Pay attention to feed intake. Pigs are especially sensitive to DON; it’s like they can sense or smell it. Therefore, they tend not to eat contaminated feed. Abstaining from eating can be a classic sign that mycotoxins are present. Instituting a proper mycotoxin management strategy will help reduce the risk of low performance in your herd. With a plan in place for mitigating mycotoxins on your operation, the chances that your pig herd will perform well in 2023 increase exponentially.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/insights-and-tips-pig-producers-2022-us-harvest-analysis","title":"\n\n                    Insights and tips for pig producers from the 2022 U.S. Harvest Analysis\n                    ","date":"February 6, 2023","contentLength":1002}},{"pageContent":"Mycotoxin contamination is a growing concern for animal feed producers worldwide. According to the 2023 Alltech Agri-Food Outlook, Asian feed production has been steadily increasing, from 350 million tons in 2012 to 465 million tons in 2022, leading to a greater reliance on imported grains. As reported by the USDA, this trend is expected to continue, which means it's now more important than ever to have a good understanding of the potential mycotoxin risk in imported raw materials. To address this concern, Alltech prepared the 2023 Alltech Asia Import Risk Analysis, a comprehensive report designed to inform the Asian feed sector and livestock producers of the potential mycotoxin contamination patterns in the grains that they import for their business in 2023. The Alltech Asia Import Risk Analysis report draws on data from Alltech’s harvest analysis programs carried out across 2022. Depending on the region and the ingredient being assessed, the test method varied between Alltech 37+, RAPIREAD and SGS. The analysis assessed the mycotoxin risks in grains — such as corn, wheat, barley and byproducts — sourced from Europe, North America, Latin America, India and Australia for feed and livestock producers in the Asia-Pacific region. Europe Throughout 2022, the persistence of drought conditions in Europe resulted in reduced crop yields and increased levels of mycotoxins. In countries such as Hungary, Serbia and Romania, many corn samples displayed levels of mycotoxins that exceeded the EU's regulatory limit of 20 ppb for animal feed. Corn samples showed an average of 3.8 mycotoxins per sample, and over 50% contained aflatoxin at an average concentration of 16 ppb. More than 27% of samples contained fumonisin at an average concentration of 1,455 ppb. Almost all wheat and barley samples were contaminated with at least one mycotoxin, with an average of 3.7 mycotoxins per sample. New emerging classes of mycotoxins were found in all wheat and barley samples, with an average concentration of 152 ppb. U.S. The weather conditions in the United States had a significant impact on the mycotoxin profile of corn samples collected for analysis. As the weather conditions got wetter moving from the West to the East, the mycotoxin levels increased. Additionally, crops harvested later in the season tended to have significantly higher toxin loads than those harvested earlier. All corn samples had at least one mycotoxin present and had an average of 6.7 mycotoxins per sample. Fusarium mycotoxins (DON, fumonisin and zearalenone) and emerging mycotoxins were more prevalent and were present in higher concentrations in most samples. The Alltech risk equivalent quantity (REQ*) system indicates that the combined impact of these mycotoxins poses a significant risk to animals and could lead to significant production losses. *REQ: A measurement of the cumulative impact of mycotoxins in reference to aflatoxin B1 Canada Canada improved notably in terms of its yields as compared to the previous year. As part of our ongoing monitoring efforts, we tested approximately 250 samples of wheat and barley from Canada using the Alltech RAPIREAD system. DON was the most commonly detected mycotoxin in the samples analysed from Canada. More than 50% of the samples tested displayed levels of DON that were higher than the level of quantification. T-2/HT-2 and zearalenone were also detected in a smaller number of samples. Although Canada's harvest was impressive, producers should still remain vigilant about the threat of mycotoxin contamination. Latin America Brazil and Argentina displayed significant reductions in yields in 2022. In Brazil, the overall yield was 5% lower than the five-year average, while Argentina saw even worse reductions in yields due to drought. The majority of the samples were found to have significant amounts of Fusarium mycotoxins. DON was the main toxin of concern in corn from this region, with average levels reaching almost 2,000 ppb. Fumonisin, T-2/HT-2 and zearalenone mycotoxins were also found in the samples. The combined effect of these mycotoxins can lead to significant losses in animal production, as well as health problems. India Limited access to fertilizers impacted the quality and yield of crops from this country. Along with the limited supply of fertilizer, both the Rabi and Kharif corn crops were heavily impacted by large amounts of rainfall, leading to a high mould count and the presence of mycotoxins. Fumonisin and aflatoxin were the most significant mycotoxins detected, with levels of up to 1,600 ppb and 40 ppb, respectively. Other mycotoxins were also present in the samples. The presence of these mycotoxins can have a significant impact on the performance, health and productivity of livestock. Australia This year's wheat and barley harvest delivered the second-highest yields on record in Australia, which is positive news for the industry. However, in the Eastern states, late rains and floods led to significant crop losses and quality issues. This has resulted in high-moisture grains, which will present storage challenges and require producers to practice continuous monitoring to maintain quality. Significant levels of DON mycotoxins were detected, reaching up to 3,200 ppb. High concentrations of DON can negatively impact animal health and performance. Therefore, it is essential for producers and animal nutritionists in Australia to remain vigilant and incorporate appropriate mitigation strategies to ensure the safety and health of their animals. Corn byproducts As the cost of raw materials that are commonly used in animal feed has continued to rise in recent years, the use of byproducts has also become increasingly popular. However, this trend poses a significant challenge when it comes to mycotoxin contamination, as corn byproducts are significantly more likely to be contaminated at higher levels compared to parent grains. To gain a better understanding of the level of mycotoxin contamination in the byproducts commonly used in animal feed, Alltech analyzed corn gluten meal and DDGS samples from North America, China and Europe using the Alltech 37+ analysis method. All samples tested were shown to have at least two mycotoxins present, with an average of 10 mycotoxins per sample. Fusarium mycotoxins (DON, fumonisin, zearalenone and fusaric acid) were the most common and significant mycotoxins detected. Emerging mycotoxins were also present. DON was found at levels of approximately 12,000 ppb and fumonisin at 19,000 ppb. High levels of mycotoxins and multiple contamination present a serious challenge for animals consuming feed that includes these byproducts. The key to mycotoxin risk management The findings outlined above highlight the need for more rigorous testing and quality-control measures in the use of byproducts in animal feed. Achieving successful mycotoxin management requires taking a holistic approach, and the only accurate way to understand the true risk presented by the feeds that animals are consuming is to use a routine mycotoxin testing program when purchasing feed ingredients and establishing nutrition plans. Conclusion Mycotoxin contamination is widespread and multifaceted, affecting a range of grains and byproducts from different regions. Mycotoxins are a critical issue for animal feed producers globally. The 2023 Alltech Asia Import Risk Analysis provides valuable insights into the potential mycotoxin risk in grains imported into the Asia-Pacific region in 2023. The report highlights the impact of environmental factors on the prevalence and amounts of mycotoxins in crops. The majority of the raw materials imported into the Asia-Pacific region are contaminated with Fusarium-related mycotoxins (DON, fumonisin, zearalenone, T-2 and fusaric acid). Implementing effective mycotoxin management strategies can reduce the risk of mycotoxin contamination, ensuring the safety and well-being of animals and the profitability of the operation — but it all comes down to reducing the mycotoxin contamination of the feed supply.

You’ve probably been taking weekly lessons and doing some hacking about, but what do you really need to do to be ready when the horse shows start? I show an Off-the-Track Thoroughbred (OFTT) in the show hunters division because I love the camaraderie that the breed shows and classes offer. We also foxhunt in the off season. But it doesn’t matter what breed or discipline you show; much of the preparation will be the same for both you and your horse. For the rider: Try on your show clothes to make sure they fit and are show-ready. They may have sustained some damage or a stain that you forgot about. After all, our shapes can change with age and varying fitness levels, and it would be no fun to wake up the morning of a show and find that you really need new breeches. If you’re not sure about what you should wear, ask your trainer. There are plenty of consignment stores, and you may be able to sell some of your clothes for store credit to buy new — or new-to-you — items. Hopefully, you have been riding all winter. If you haven’t, you may need to work on your fitness a bit! Since I hunt, I keep my stamina up pretty well, but my conditioning for riding in the ring and using my body and legs can suffer. Make sure that you get back into a regular practice for the specific discipline in which you’ll be competing. Eat right! When you maintain a good diet, you sleep better, and when you sleep better, you have more stamina to get through the day. That applies to riding as well. I know that, when I eat a bunch of junk — especially at the overnight shows — my body pays the price in the show ring. Have your rig checked out. I use mine year-round, so I do regular checks. Lots of trucks and trailers that are used for showing sit for most of the winter, so take yours to the local shop, and make sure that you’ve got a good floor on your trailer, good tires, good brakes and working electric. How old is your helmet? Helmets should be replaced every 2 to 3 years, as well as after any fall during which you hit your head. Do you need a new helmet? Check it out now! Map out your show plans. Will you go to every show that your barn attends? Are you aiming for one or two a month? Will you show locally or travel far and stay overnight? Maybe a bit of both? What are your goals? Photo by Chandler Willet For the horse: Check your horse’s body condition. How did they fare through the colder weather? Since I have OTTBs, I work hard to keep weight on them through the winter. There are times when we must look fancy to hunt, so maintaining turnout and keeping them in good health is important. I want to optimize their digestive environment, and if you do, too, this is something that you need to do now — not a few days before the show. To help foster a positive digestive environment, try Lifeforce Elite Performance. Its comprehensive formula, which includes chondroitin sulfate and yeast culture, supports complete wellness in performance horses. Additionally, one bag offers a 40-day supply. Have your vet examine your horse. While my horse gets regular chiropractic treatments year-round, I just had mine looked at last week. He gets tired toward the end of hunt season as we go into show season, and I want to make sure that I’m not overlooking anything that might help us to be as successful as possible in our pursuits. Lifeforce Elite Performance helps here, too. It’s made in a drug-free facility, includes 100% organic trace minerals, and helps maintain healthy cartilage and synovial fluid in horses. Give your tack a good once-over. Take it home and deep-clean and oil it. Take your bridle apart and pull the leathers off your saddle. Not only will this allow you to get to and clean the hard-to-reach spots; it will also allow you to check everything for damage and proper safety. Start schooling one level above the level that you’ll compete at, assuming that doing so is safe for you and your horse. Do you need to body-clip as part of your preparations for the equestrian season? Make sure that you do this at least 10 to 14 days before you head to the show ring. That will give the coat time to recover. Load up! Has your horse been on the trailer since the last show season? It’s the worst feeling when you go to load and leave and your horse doesn’t want to get on the trailer, creating stress for both you and your horse. Load your horse up and take him on a little ride. If you have trouble loading your horse, now is the time to remedy the problem. Call a professional for help. That’s it. You are now ready to go. Have a great season — and GOOD LUCK!","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/horse-show-preparation-12-tips-riders-and-horses","title":"\n\n                    Horse show preparation: 12 tips for riders and horses\n                    ","date":"February 14, 2023","contentLength":882}},{"pageContent":"With the spring horse shows just around the corner, it's time to prepare your horse for success in the show ring. Whether you are an experienced rider or are new to the sport, there are a few key steps you can take to ensure that your horse is ready to perform at its best in the horse show ring. One of the most important steps you can take while preparing for horse shows is to follow a comprehensive equestrian training program. This should include a combination of riding knowledge and techniques, as well as physical fitness and mental preparation. Riders and horses must be able to perform a straight and organized working trot for at least twenty minutes without a break before they even consider horse showing. Many horses do not build up enough forward momentum and balance in their training to engage and build musculature their hind-end, core and topline. Additionally, when horse showing, excitement and nerves can take over — and those feelings can be transferred to your horse. Working with a mental skills coach along with your riding trainer can help you develop a training plan that is tailored to your horse's strengths and abilities, allowing you to focus on specific areas for improvement. Equestrian training develops a rider’s mental acuity, both in and out of the saddle. Through equestrian training, riders learn discipline, perseverance, grit and hard work. They cultivate a feel for what is correct while learning to be brave and in control of their emotions and challenging themselves. They also learn how to accept feedback and gain physical and emotional strength through showing horses. Show horse training allows riders to learn to cooperate with their animal to achieve great success. Another important aspect of preparation is to ensure that your horse is healthy enough for show horse training and is in top physical condition. One way to support your horse's health and performance is by providing the proper nutrition. Lifeforce Elite can help. Lifeforce Elite is a performance supplement specifically designed for horses, providing them with the essential trace minerals they need to maintain healthy cartilage and synovial fluid in their joints. By providing them with these essential nutrients, Lifeforce Elite can help support your horse's health and performance, allowing them to perform at their best in the ring. In addition to proper nutrition, it is also important to ensure that your horse is well-rested and hydrated leading up to the show season. This may involve adjusting your horse's exercise routine or providing them with additional time to rest and recover between show horse training sessions. Finally, it is important to have a plan in place for the day of the show. This may involve coordinating with your coach or trainer to ensure that you and your showing horses arrive on time, have a clear understanding of the schedule and are prepared for any unexpected events. Learn the proper warm-up ring etiquette, and have a plan established before you get on your horse. By having a plan in place, you can help minimize stress for both you and your horse and ensure a smooth and successful showing experience. Here are 10 steps you can take to help ensure that you will have a successful show: Minimize stress by packing early and being organized. Eat a nutritious breakfast (and also lunch, if you show late). Learn your course or pattern early so that you have time to visualize and consider the training questions being asked. Breathe throughout the day as you get nervous, and make a list of the places where you will have time to breathe on the course. Help out your barn-mates, teammates and fellow competitors. If you see opportunities to be a good member of our community, take them. Maintain a positive attitude no matter what happens in competition or on the day of the event. Express gratitude to every horse and person who spends their day with you at the horse show. Make sure to determine what you are going to wear the week before the event and that everything you have is clean, polished and ironed, as needed. Pass left shoulder to left shoulder in the schooling ring. Focus on your horse and on achieving correct and straight riding, and the ribbons will follow! Proper horsemanship and sportsmanship are the keys to success. The horse show season is an exciting time and serves as a great opportunity to showcase your horse's skills and abilities. With the right training, support and preparation, you can help your horse perform at its best at horse shows. Lifeforce Elite can also help, as it is dedicated to supporting your horse's health and performance.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/how-prepare-your-horse-successful-horse-show-season","title":"\n\n                    How to prepare your horse for a successful horse show season\n                    ","date":"February 20, 2023","contentLength":790}},{"pageContent":"Providing the proper diet is essential for the health, vitality and well-being of our pets, so we must ensure that, through the pet food we feed them, our pets are receiving all the nutrients they need to live a healthy and happy life. The growing market demand for natural, functional, holistic and sustainable products has put pressure on the industry to develop pet foods that meet certain expectations. In the United States — the world's largest pet food market — natural ingredients are now widely used and are valued primarily by consumers for their contributions to the health and wellness of pets. The demand for and interest in natural ingredients continues to grow, and more research is becoming available that supports its inclusion in pet foods. We're hearing a lot about nutrigenomics and other “-omics” technologies, which contribute to the development of personalized nutrition; time will tell whether this trend will transition from food for humans to pet foods as well. How does a well-fed microbiota impact the animal? The microbiome is currently a topic of great interest in research. All living organisms — including humans and pets — have different microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa) that live, for example, on their skin or inside their bodies. These microorganisms live together as communities, and the collection of their genomes is known as the microbiome. Microbiome communities are unique to certain habitats, such as the skin, lungs and gut, to name a few, and can prove crucial to the health of pets' immune systems. Pet nutrition and diets are deeply related to the composition and diversity of the microbiome — which, in turn, plays an important role in the proper functioning of the digestive and immune systems of dogs and cats, thereby ultimately affecting their overall health and well-being. The microbiome and microbiota: What's the difference? The gastrointestinal tract is made up of trillions of microorganisms, which are known collectively as microbiota. Microbiota, or intestinal flora, constitute an ecological colony of beneficial microorganisms that reside in the digestive systems of both humans and pets. These microorganisms are responsible for many vital functions, such as the production of certain neurons in the adult brain, the functioning of the immune system, hormonal regulation, energy metabolism and the maintenance of body weight. These microorganisms, together with their genetic material or genome, create a microecosystem called the microbiome. While it is true that, during the pandemic, the general public’s interest in digestive health increased, the scientific community has been paying close attention to this area for several years — and, above all, to the intestinal microbiota. This is due to the role it plays in various metabolic functions, including but not limited to immune system maturation, appetite control and energy metabolism. There is already a plethora of research in which it is evident that alterations to the intestinal microbiota are associated with several chronic ailments derived from inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity and diabetes, to mention just a few. How can we feed the microbiome? The gastrointestinal microbiome of cats and dogs is increasingly recognized as a metabolically active organ that is undoubtedly linked to their overall health. Feed serves as a substrate for the microbiome of pets, as it plays an important role in defining the composition and metabolism of the microbiome. In turn, the microbiome facilitates the digestion of host nutrients and the production of postbiotics, which are compounds or metabolites derived from bacteria and which can influence the health of our pets. To maintain the health of our pets, it is important to take care of both their intestinal flora and their immune systems. For this, you need to \"feed\" the bacteria with prebiotics and strengthen them with probiotics; the former feed the beneficial bacteria of the gut, while the latter add living organisms to the gut environment that help maintain a diverse and beneficial bacterial population. Prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics for pets: What's the difference? People and pet parents play a role in shaping our microbiomes and those of our pets through the foods we choose. Pet food in particular is formulated to contain the typical nutritional blocks of carbohydrates, proteins and fats — but increasingly, it also includes ingredients that target the microbiome, such as prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics. Each of these compounds, as well as their relative proportions in pet food, can affect the composition of the microbiome or its functions. Accumulating evidence suggests that dietary components may influence not only gastrointestinal diseases but also allergies, oral health, weight management, diabetes and kidney disease, due to changes in the gastrointestinal microbiome. Scientific literature is abundant on how these prebiotic compounds work and benefit the host — which they do by blocking receptor sites used by pathogens. Such prebiotic compounds also serve as \"food\" that allows beneficial bacteria to produce metabolites to facilitate nutrient digestion and the host’s immune response. Probiotics are live microorganisms that, when provided in adequate amounts in the diet, can improve the gut microbial balance. In recent years, the term “postbiotic” has been highlighted by both the scientific community and the popular press due to its association with physiological and metabolic benefits in human health. Postbiotics are not necessarily new but are, rather, a different way of defining the beneficial metabolites or metabolic byproducts generated by the commensal microflora present in the digestive tract, which can directly influence the host’s health. Some examples of beneficial metabolites or metabolic byproducts are enzymes, peptides, organic acids, bacteriocins, flavonoids and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs). The SCFAs butyrate, propionate and acetate are examples of postbiotics. They are products of probiotic degradation and offer a variety of health benefits. For instance, they provide a source of energy, regulate potential anti-cancer activity, improve the intestinal barrier, signal satiety by positively impacting glucose and energy homeostasis, and promote the growth of other bacteria through bacterial cross-feeding. Postbiotics lower the luminal pH and create a less favorable environment for pathogenic species. What solutions does Alltech offer for the pet market?

A healthy digestive system is possibly the most vital function of the gut, as the digestive tract facilitates the important process of nutrient breakdown and absorption. Interactions between microorganisms from the environment and those within the gut of the animal can potentially lead to an imbalance in the fish gut microbiome — which, in turn, can negatively impact the normal functioning of the digestive system of the fish. In addition to facilitating digestion, the gut also serves as a first line of defense against harmful disease. Often, farmed fish tend to be at greater risk for disease than terrestrial species due to the aqueous nature of their habitat, where they are subjected to a wider range of environmental conditions and microorganisms that offer their own unique challenges. Prioritizing aquaculture management practices that focus on fostering a healthy gut will help ensure the production of fish that are robust and high-performing. Barrier protection and gut wall integrity The mucosal layer One of the most common skin conditions amongst humans is eczema or dermatitis. While this issue can be genetic, it is also often triggered when the moisture barrier of a person’s skin is damaged or disrupted due to environmental or dietary factors. Once damaged, the moisture barrier can be very difficult to repair, and as a result, the affected person will experience dryness, itching, redness, swelling, pain and discomfort. Now, think of fish. The aquatic equivalent of a human’s moisture barrier is the fish’s mucosal coating, which is a layer of mucus covering their skin, gills and guts. This layer plays a primary role in the innate immune response that helps protect animals from disease. If the mucosal layer is not kept intact, opportunistic pathogens can gain access to the animal and disease outbreaks can occur. Poor nutrition, low-quality water and exposure to stress can all lead to the breakdown of the mucosal layer. Microbial diversity As previously stated, upsetting the balance of a fish’s microbiome can result in enteritis, poor digestion, and reduced feed intake and conversion. An increased amount and diversity of good bacteria in the gut can enhance the innate immunity of the fish, helping improve performance and supporting an efficient digestive system. Increasing microbial diversity is also well-documented as being associated with an increased resistance to pathogen colonization. Research has shown that Alltech's range of gut health solutions have the ability to influence microbial diversity and promote bacteria phylum that help balance intestinal pH, improve nutrient digestibility and aid in carbohydrate and protein fermentation. The decrease in the dominance of one bacterial group and restoration of the microbial balance is key for optimal aquatic gut health. Ways to support a healthy gut Applying targeted nutrition In light of modern realities like supply-chain disruptions, the unavailability of raw materials and increasing consumer demand for sustainable practices, fish farmers are facing more challenges than ever before when it comes to feeding and nutrition. In the gut, anti-nutritional factors associated with some plant-based raw materials can disrupt the natural microbiome, leading to inflammation and enteritis and potentially resulting in cell death at the microvilli level. This turn of events disrupts mucosal expression, thereby damaging the integrity of the gut. The recent decrease in the use of marine ingredients and increase in the prevalence of and preference for plant-based materials demands a deeper understanding of the nutrient requirements of commercially cultured fish. Offering specialized nutrition can serve as an additional defensive strategy against disease and can help improve overall gut health. Alltech’s gut health program is built on glycomic research and focuses on yeast-based structures and their prebiotic interactions. These products are proven to be an essential tool in the maintenance of the structural integrity of the gut and in promoting gut health and immunological functions. Aquate® is a gut health solution from Alltech for aquatic species that combines two of their other proven products: Actigen® and Bio-Mos®. In aquaculture, the mode of action and benefits provided by these solutions have been extensively documented via both scientific research and on-farm applications. Including Aquate technologies in the diet of fish can lead to significant improvements in the gut structure, resulting in an increased growth rate and FCR and reduced mortality rates. Minimizing environmental stressors Acute and chronic stress brought on by environmental factors usually manifests as marked structural changes in the gut. Stress impacts tissues that are in direct contact with their environment and requires a cascade of defense responses from the animal, which could lead to depletion of micro-nutrient reserves and ultimately cause tissue damage. This turn of events affects the integrity of the skin, gills and guts of the fish, and these issues are especially relevant for fish farmed in marine settings, as these species must ingest large volumes of the surrounding water to maintain an osmotic balance with their environment. Therefore, ensuring optimal water quality is imperative to maintaining a healthy fish gut. There are many factors to consider when attempting to optimize water quality. For instance, fish cannot regulate their own body temperature, and different species each have an optimal temperature range in which they are most comfortable. As such, water temperature plays a key role in important processes like feed intake, digestion, growth, and responses to stress and infection. Other factors that impact water quality and should be continuously monitored include: Dissolved oxygen: Fish take in dissolved oxygen from the water through their gills. Dissolved oxygen is vital for the health, welfare and performance of aquatic animals. As a rule, the oxygen saturation of the water should be kept as high as possible within a culture facility. If it falls below 80%, saturation stress conditions can set in. Acidity and alkalinity (pH): CO2 from fish excretion in the culture system leads to the formation of a weak acid and can impact the pH level of the water. The acceptable pH range for most species is normally between 6.5 and 7.5, although some species do well at pH levels as low as 5.5. Gas bubble trauma: This occurs when the blood of the fish becomes supersaturated with gas (i.e., nitrogen). This issue is often correlated with the system design. As such, it is important to measure the total gas pressure (TGP) of the water. If the value is too high, degassing the water is essential. Other things to monitor and test for when assessing water conditions include nitrite and nitrate, CO2 and ammonia (NH3) levels, particularly in recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS). The presence of these elements in sub-optimal amounts can create conditions that are detrimental to the health of fish stocks. Keeping the balance Ensuring optimal health in aquaculture production starts from within; however, we must remember that what is happening on the inside is often a reflection of what is going on outside, and vice versa. Therefore, the key to a healthy gut is maintaining balance. This means fostering a healthy fish microbiome by maintaining gut integrity and structure. It also means keeping a balance between the animal’s environment and nutrition and the challenges associated with the pathogens that may be present in their environment. If you want to learn more about the importance of gut health in aquatic species, you may be interested in reading “Inside/Out: The Essential Guide to the Skin, Gills and Guts of Fish,” written by John Sweetman, international project manager for aquaculture at Alltech, and Gijs Rutjes, technical support manager at Alltech Coppens. “Inside/Out” is an educational tool for fish farmers, feed millers and anyone interested in aquaculture. The book is designed to offer user-friendly insights into how these tissues work, allowing producers to make informed decisions that will encourage optimal performance in their fish.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/effective-aquaculture-management-starts-gut","title":"\n\n                    Effective aquaculture management starts with the gut\n                    ","date":"February 6, 2023","contentLength":1312}},{"pageContent":"A confinement area is meant to be your horse's outdoor living quarters. It’s important to design this area so it provides opportunities for both physical and mental stimulation for your horse — but also so it’s mud-free and chore-efficient for you, which is especially important as we head into winter, with all its chore-efficiency challenges. One of the key aspects of improving pasture production and overall equine management is the time when you take your horses off your pasture. In the winter, keeping horses off saturated, rain-soaked soils and dormant or frozen pasture plants is critical for pasture management and will help you maintain a healthy stand of grass next summer. Soggy soils or dormant grass plants simply cannot survive continuous grazing and trampling in the winter months, so they die out, giving weeds — and dust, in bare spots — the chance to take their place next summer. You can greatly improve the health and productivity of your pastures by keeping your horse in a confinement area during the pasture’s dormant winter months. Additionally, you can utilize this area during the summer to keep your pastures from becoming overgrazed. Here are some points to consider when creating a chore-efficient, mud-free confinement area: The amount of land you have available, the number of horses you have, their ages and temperaments, and the amount of regular exercise they receive should all play a role in determining the size of your confinement area. The size of the area can vary from a place where they can move around a bit (e.g., 16’ x 16’) to a long, narrow enclosure where a horse can run or play in its paddock. For that setup, you might create an area 20 or 30 feet wide and 100 feet in length. Locate this area on higher ground for better drainage and away from creeks, wetlands or other bodies of water to prevent any polluted runoff (from manure, urine or mud) from reaching these areas and contaminating them. For chore efficiency, your confinement area should be conveniently located near your barn, hay storage and manure compost sites to make it easy for you to care for your horse while also maintaining the confinement area. A good option is to offer one paddock per horse set up like a “run” from a stall or shelter. This gives the horse free access to a clean, dry place to eat. When choosing a location, try to pick a place that makes it convenient for you to feed in this area. Pick up manure every one to three days to help reduce your horse's parasite load and to avoid creating a habitat for flies and insects — along with annoying winter mud. To reduce erosion and improve drainage, use some type of footing — at least in the highest-traffic areas — around gates, by stock watering areas or in front of stalls. Popular footing choices include crushed rock (no larger than 5/8 inch) or coarse washed sand. Footing should be 2 to 4 inches deep. Install rain gutters and downspouts on any roofs surrounding your winter paddock. Divert clean rainwater to nearby vegetation via a rain barrel or cistern or into a rain garden or an undisturbed area of woods. Diverting clean rainwater away from your horse’s confinement area reduces the amount of mud they (and you) have to deal with. It also prevents manure and urine from being washed out of the paddock and into nearby bodies of water. Choose the very safest fencing you can for your winter paddock. Whatever type of fencing you choose, you may want to reinforce it with some type of electric tape or power fencing to make the fencing a “psychological barrier” (i.e., one horses choose to avoid). Ensure that your building corners are safe and that there are no protruding objects that could hurt a horse, such as bolt ends, nails, boards or the tops of metal T-posts. Watch out for the corners of roofs and the bottom edges of metal buildings. There should be no wires or electrical cords hanging in the yard and absolutely no junk, garbage or machinery in this area. The gates in confinement areas need to be adequately sized for the types of truck deliveries you expect or equipment you will use (such as for gravel or sand for footing or to get tractors in and out to move that footing). Even though your horses can move around in their confinement areas, they still need regular exercise. Plan for and maintain a regular exercise program for your horse that includes at least two or three exercise sessions per week that last a minimum of 30 minutes each. This can include ride time, lunging, in-hand groundwork or maybe even turnout time with other horses. Sand footing is easy to clean, improves drainage, and comfortable for horses. For ideas on how to provide equine enrichment and mental stimulation for horses in their confinement areas, see my previous article on various equine enrichment opportunities. In addition, my article on composting horse manure will help you set up a system for managing the manure collected in your confinement area. Creating and utilizing a mud-free confinement area will lead to greater chore efficiency for you this winter, along with fewer muck-related horse health issues. It will also lead to more productive pastures next grazing season. Improved pastures offer a cost-savings for you through greater pasture productivity and less money spent on supplemental feed. These efforts add up to a prettier picture for you and your community to enjoy, along with a more sustainable future for all.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/creating-mud-free-confinement-area-your-horse","title":"\n\n                    Creating a mud-free confinement area for your horse\n                    ","date":"December 9, 2022","contentLength":948}},{"pageContent":"The three-pronged approach to beef sustainability — environmental, economic and social — often focuses most on the pillar of environmental stewardship. In the beef industry, much attention is given to the environmental impacts associated with beef production practices. However, highlighting the benefits that beef production can impart to the ecosystem can help the industry develop a more complete picture of beef’s environmental footprint. Many companies have set environmental sustainability goals that project a targeted reduction in their carbon emissions. In order to reach these goals, the practice of purchasing carbon credits from suppliers to help offset emissions through a carbon marketplace is becoming more common and popular. What are carbon credits? Carbon credits are permits that each represent 1 metric ton of carbon dioxide (CO2) or the equivalent amount (CO2-eq) of a different greenhouse gas (GHG) that is removed from the atmosphere. The term “carbon offset” is commonly interchanged with the phrase “carbon credit,” but they vary slightly in meaning. Carbon offsetting is the purchase of carbon credits to compensate for emissions that have been created by a business or lifestyle. A carbon offset is a reduction in GHG emissions that compensates for emissions occurring elsewhere in the supply chain. Each GHG has a different global warming potential (GWP), which allows for comparisons to be made between the global warming impacts of various gases relative to CO2. The GWP measures how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a GHG will absorb over a given time frame (i.e., 100 years) in relation to 1 ton of CO2 (EPA, 2022). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC; 2021): Methane (CH4) has a GWP of 27–30 times higher than CO2 over a 100-year timescale Nitrous oxide (N2O) has a GWP 273 times higher than CO2 over a 100-year timescale The average American generates 16 metric tons of CO2-eq annually, which is enough to fill more than three and a half Olympic-sized swimming pools (Tso, 2020). These emissions come from driving cars, utilizing electricity and gas in homes, food systems and other day-to-day activities. What are carbon markets? Carbon markets are economic trading systems that support the buying and selling of carbon credits. Carbon markets provide monetary incentives for credit producers to adopt approved carbon-reducing practices, while credit purchasers utilize the offsets to reach their carbon emission goals. Carbon markets can be split into two categories: compliance and voluntary. Compliance markets Carbon markets are created as the result of regulatory requirements or national, regional or international policies. Cap-and-trade systems are traditional examples of mandatory programs in which regulated businesses are issued GHG emission allowances or permits that add up to a total maximum, or a capped amount. Companies that exceed their permitted emissions allowance must buy permits from others with available permits for sale, or they will face penalties (UNDP, 2022). Carbon offsets may be used as a compliance option for some regulated entities (Stubbs et al., 2021). In the U.S., California is the only state with a cap-and-trade market, which was established in 2013 and which targets the state’s electric power plants, industrial plants and fuel distributors. The state has a goal of lowering its emissions below the levels seen in 1990 by 2030. Entities that are required to comply with California’s program can use offsets to satisfy 4% of their obligation, which includes agricultural offsets from livestock manure management projects, rice cultivation projects and forest management projects (Stubbs et al., 2021). The European Union launched the first international cap-and-trade or emissions trading system (ETS) in 2005, and in 2021, China launched the world’s largest ETS, leading the way for the development of other national and subnational ETS (UNDP, 2022). Voluntary markets Currently, most carbon market programs are voluntary markets, which includes the buying and selling of carbon credits on a voluntary basis outside of a regulatory framework (e.g., corporate sustainability reporting). Transactions involving credits can occur directly between participants and buyers or can be mediated by other parties or programs. Sellers of carbon credits are typically farmers and ranchers, and they are paid for generating carbon credits by adopting management practices that meet specific criteria for carbon emissions reduction or sequestration (e.g., no-till, cover crops, crop rotation, anaerobic digesters, grazing management, manure management, reforestation, etc.). Sellers are usually paid on a per-acre or per-ton basis of carbon sequestered (Shockley and Snell, 2021). The monetary compensation for carbon credits varies widely based on the practice and program, averaging between $10–20 per credit (Stubbs et al., 2021). There are a handful of voluntary carbon markets in operation, including programs established by Bayer, Ecosystem Services Market Consortium, Nori, Verra, Gold Standard and several others. Since voluntary markets remain unchecked by regulators and do not have caps on how many tons of emissions can be offset, there are several organizations that set standards and that validate carbon credits based on those standards. Verra, for example, has set a widely used carbon-credit validation standard — called Verified Carbon Standard — that is based on accounting methodologies specific to the project type, independent auditing and a registry system (Thompson and Miranda, 2021). Other programs, such as Nori, follow a similar process using practices that qualify under their methodology and a third-party verifier. The eligibility for voluntary programs, approved practices, verification processes and compensation of these voluntary markets differ widely. The voluntary carbon market options for agriculture continue to emerge and evolve, and pilot projects and reduction practices continue to be assessed. There is much to learn about carbon sequestration, monetizing production practices based on GHG emissions reductions and accurately measuring carbon emissions from different industry sectors. As many programs currently focus on crop and forest production practices, there is room for beef production practices to enter the market.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/understanding-carbon-credits-beef-sustainability","title":"\n\n                    Understanding carbon credits for beef sustainability\n                    ","date":"February 14, 2023","contentLength":980}},{"pageContent":"Feed is expensive — especially the grains that serve as the major energy source in most finishing rations for beef cattle. With this expense on the rise, nutritionists work hard to make sure that their feedlot rations for beef cattle are high-quality feeds that support weight gain and feed conversion efficiency. Energy is a key element to consider when developing a feed to promote weight gain in beef cattle. Both grains and forages contain energy that is useful when finishing beef cattle. Grains are considered high-energy feeds because the energy in grains comes largely from starch. Starch is composed of glucose chains, which can easily be broken down by rumen microorganisms. The structural components of forage — such as cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin — surround the nutrients with complex linkages. Rumen microbes can’t always break these linkages, however, limiting the availability of energy in the forage. This is particularly true for feedlot cattle, as the ruminal pH of feedlot cattle is less than optimal for fibrolytic microorganisms, resulting in reduced fiber digestion. When thinking of these structural components, imagine them as locks protecting the energy and nutrients in feedstuffs. Enzymes — which are either endogenous, from the microbial population, or the exogenous enzymes in feed additives — can break apart these protective structural components, unlocking both the potential of feeds and the potential of the cattle being fed. Enzymes can make a difference in finishing cattle The scientific literature shows inconsistent results for enzyme use in beef cattle diets. However, this is likely due to the wide variety of enzymes that have been tested, the vast array of feedstuffs that have been used in experimental diets, and the kind of data that has been recorded. For example, cattle grazing cool-season versus tropical grasses have different enzymatic needs, because those grasses have different chemical compositions. The same goes for cattle consuming corn silage versus barley-based finishing diets. This is especially true in diets that utilize byproducts, as the most easily accessible nutrients have generally already been extracted by the initial industry that processed the material. Starch-based diets: Corn, barley Forage-based diets: Corn silage, barley silage, hay and grasses Byproducts in diets: Corn gluten meal, distillers grains, cottonseed hulls, etc. The rumen is a complex, enzyme-rich environment. The microbes of the rumen can break down most components of foods — but the extent and speed of this breakdown is often a limiting factor for nutrient release. A common question when discussing rumen efficiency is: Can a small enzyme addition really make a change in rumen function and feed digestion? For an enzyme to be effective, several factors need to be met: It must fill a gap in feed digestion not met by the existing microbiota. The type of linkage it opens must be present in the feed. The enzyme needs to be stable in stored and mixed feed. The enzyme must be active at rumen temperature and pH. It must be able to survive in the feed. Returning to the lock-and-key metaphor about enzymes, any enzyme added to a diet must fit the “locks” on the components of that diet. How do you measure enzyme efficacy in finishing cattle? Measuring the effects and value of enzymes can be tricky. Often, researchers expect an increase in the rate or extent of digestion for a particular diet component — and sometimes, they are right. Other times, however, the enzyme acts in an unanticipated way, such as changing the rate of passage to promote feed intake, shifting the metabolites available to microbes in the rumen, or even affecting downstream metabolic processes. If researchers are not measuring these actions, they may conclude that the enzyme had no effect, when in reality, they were simply looking in the wrong direction and missed the action of the enzyme. As such, in enzyme research, it is important to look beyond intake, weight gain and feed conversion and to measure a wide range of parameters to fully capture the effects and mechanisms of a given enzyme. Outside of the scientific realm, it’s important to recognize what you expect an enzyme to do when it is added to the diet. Here are a few common reasons for utilizing enzymes: By incorporating enzymes into your finishing rations for beef cattle, you may be able to utilize lower-cost ingredients in the diet while still experiencing equal performance. Enzymes can help improve feed efficiency in feedlot cattle without making any other changes to the diet. Getting more pounds on your animals can be possible with enzymes. Certain enzymes can support superior carcass weight. More pounds per day = more dollars. Some enzymes reduce digesta viscosity, which can contribute to better post-ruminal nutrient absorption and support digestive health. Get the most out of your rations. Look at your cattle’s diet and your goals for your operation. Could enzymes help you reach those goals? There are enzyme options available — just know your goals Most research on cattle focuses on tweaking existing procedures, feeding plans, etc. Researching enzymes takes years of trial and error, on both the benchtop and in the animal, to find effective, cost-efficient, scalable options. This type of research is slow but generates the knowledge that can lead to new insights and technologies that allow us to maximize feed efficiency in feedlot cattle. New enzymes are popping up regularly. If you choose to utilize these additives in your feedlot rations, be sure that they are effective on the ration ingredients you use and will provide the results you want in your operation. Consult with your nutritionist or an Alltech representative below to learn more about how enzymes can work in your operation. I want to learn more about nutrition for my beef cattle.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/unlock-potential-feedlot-rations-beef-cattle","title":"\n\n                    Unlock the potential of feedlot rations for beef cattle \n                    ","date":"September 13, 2021","contentLength":956}},{"pageContent":"If your pet food company produces balanced diets for puppies and kittens, you know that it is not always easy to differentiate yourselves from the competition. With numerous options at the neighborhood pet food store and on the increasingly popular e-commerce sites, new pet parents are often bombarded with decisions. Should they go with raw diets for puppies? Dry or wet food for kittens? High-protein diets? Vitamin and mineral supplements? Ultimately, you want pet consumers to choose your nutrition programs. Let’s look at three ways to make sure that your puppy and kitten diets stand out on the shelf. 1. Beware of the “high-protein” hype. Yes, puppies and kittens have nutritional requirements that include high protein and calorie levels, but be wary of oversimplifying this message. Protein sources are not created equal, and claiming that a food is “high protein” is not as important as the levels of essential amino acids that are present in the diets of young kittens and puppies. Protein requirements for puppies and kittens are really requirements for higher levels of high-quality protein. Do your best to convey to consumers that your pet food brand contains excellent-quality protein from a traceable source that specifically meets the needs of a puppy or kitten. Furthermore, taking a step backwards, a growing animal’s body also requires nutrients that support its cells’ ability to produce proteins. Nutrients such as nucleotides, which are the molecules that make up an animal’s genetic material (DNA and RNA), are in high demand throughout the animal’s life, but never more so than during the growth phase, when the gastrointestinal and immune systems are developing quickly. Nucleotides are found in high levels in the mother’s milk, but young companion animals still have an increased need for nucleotides, even after weaning. Research has shown that nucleotide supplementation in puppies increases their immune systems’ capacity to respond to dangerous diseases, such as parvovirus. Arming your pet food with the organic molecules and amino acids that really matter for growth and development in puppies and kittens, such as those found in Alltech’s NUCLEO-SACC™, will deliver real results for your consumers and, ultimately, the pets they love. 2. Make it palatable. This may seem fairly obvious, but reduced food consumption in growing kittens and puppies can lead to major growth and developmental problems. It is important to communicate to pet owners that while the desired growth rate for both puppies and kittens is “slow and steady” so as to prevent the over-development of their musculoskeletal systems, young animals will grow the quickest in their first 6 months of life and need to be fed in line with those needs. Building your puppy and kitten diets with highly palatable ingredients, such as glutamic acid, can help promote feed intake in a controlled manner. Additionally, using a body condition scoring system can help to guide nutrition for kittens and puppies. Teaching pet owners how to use body conditioning can help prevent under- or over-development. For both dogs and cats, body condition is typically assessed on a scale of 1 to 9, with 1 being severely underweight and 9 being obese. An ideal body condition for cats and dogs is between 4 and 5, where their ribs can be easily felt but not seen and a waistline can clearly be identified. In growing companion animals, body condition is likely to change more rapidly, and there could very well be some “awkward” growing phases. All is well. The important thing is to keep their body condition in mind so that you can adjust their diet as needed before anything gets too out of whack. Overall, helping consumers understand that growing pets require a balanced diet that meets their increased nutritional demands without overloading their body systems is key. Designing pet food diets that are palatable and therefore encourage consumption means that consumers are less likely to overfeed an imbalanced ration to compensate for what is missing, and that could have a hugely positive downstream effect on their pets’ long-term health. 3. Focus on functional nutrients. Functional nutrients are those that may provide health benefits beyond the basic nutritional requirements. Regardless of what type of pet food your company produces, be sure to include functional nutrients that can assist with young companion animals’ proper growth and development. One functional nutrient that often goes unmentioned is inositol. Inositol is a sugar that is found naturally in the body. Inositol supports proper nerve and muscle function, in addition to optimal cell membrane development. Because of its role in cell structure, it is important for growing animals to have quality sources of inositol in their diets. Additionally, ensuring that your young companion animal pet food contains 100% organic trace minerals (including copper, zinc, manganese, iron and selenium) will provide a huge boost to your nutrition program. Trace minerals are especially critical during growth to ensure the proper development of all of the animal’s body tissues. Organic trace minerals have been shown to be absorbed and utilized at higher rates in the body than their inorganic counterparts, which means that development and performance can be improved just by feeding your brand’s diet! Summary Ultimately, you care about your pet food diets because you care about the puppies and kittens who will be eating them. Adding sufficient levels of functional nutrients — such as essential amino acids, nucleotides, inositol and glutamic acid — in addition to high-quality essential trace minerals will make your pet food brand the best it can be while also ensuring incredible results for your customers’ new family members.

More and more, consumers are looking to pet supplements to boost their pets’ dietary nutrition or to support a particular need, such as joint health. Pet supplementation is a diverse category that includes well-established products and ingredients such as fish oil for skin and coat health, and new and emerging formulations, like CBD for calming. It’s no surprise, then, that with a growing amount of attention being paid to product labels, many ingredients that appear in human supplementation have crossed over to pet categories. We wanted to find out more about this intriguing market segment. In June 2022, as part of our ongoing research into pet supplement consumers, MarketPlace, a brand strategy agency focused on the pet and wellness spaces, conducted an online survey of 737 pet parents in the U.S. to ask them about their knowledge and experiences with supplements. Forty percent of them reported that they had purchased pet supplements in the past year. We hypothesized that pet supplement consumers may have certain tendencies and preferences that are stronger or more pronounced than the average pet parent. This appears to be the case. Let’s dig more into what the data tells us about the people who buy supplements for their pets. Health-minded information seekers buy supplements Data from the survey shows that many consumers who buy supplements for their pets are also likely to seek out information proactively about nutrition. Among that subset of pet supplement consumers, 46% report having spent more than one hour in the past 12 months researching vitamins and/or minerals. Veterinarians are an authoritative source of information on nutrition and wellness to both the average pet parent and the pet supplement shopper. Nearly three-out-of-five pet supplement consumers (59%) said they seek inspiration or information on their pets’ health and wellness from their veterinarian. Consumers are also somewhat more likely than average to report seeking pet health information via online search, through friends and family, and from posts on social media such as YouTube and Facebook. Tellingly, preferences for certain information sources on pet nutrition strongly parallel preferences in human nutrition. Like veterinarians for pet nutrition, the personal physician is considered a top authoritative source of information on the personal nutrition of both pet parents and the companion animal supplement audience. According to our survey, 61% of pet supplement consumers seek inspiration or information on their personal health and wellness from their personal physician, compared to 55% for the average pet parent. Pet supplement consumers are likewise turning to social sources – friends, family and social media –to inform their research into human nutrition. These findings suggest a multichannel approach to media and advertising strategy may be effective in creating meaningful touchpoints for the target pet supplement consumer segment and breaking through the ever-growing clutter of brand messaging found online and in retail stores. Buyers prioritize need states and specific benefits When shopping for supplements, need state drives purchase intent. Pet supplement consumers said they tend to seek a specific benefit first when shopping for such a product. According to the survey, those who buy supplements for their pets are likely to report having purchased skin and coat, joint health, or daily wellness applications in the past 12 months. Calming occasions are also driving supplement purchases, especially for vet visits or inclement weather. Other top reasons for giving calming/anxiety-reducing supplements include travel, time at home alone, and outside noises such as fireworks. The survey data also shows that people who give their pets supplements are also more likely than average to: Agree that “organic” claims indicate high quality in food, treats, or supplements for pets. Have bought pet dental care products or treats that promote health in the past 12 months. Have heard of the microbiome and to have looked up information about the microbiome. Target customers shop across channels, read reviews To be successful in breaking through to their target market, brands must gain insights into how pet supplement consumers shop in-store and online, and better understand how they use media to get information that informs those shopping decisions. Our data suggests that pet supplement consumers have stronger-than-average tendencies when it comes to researching and shopping for their companion animals. For example, those who buy pet supplements, on average, said they rely more on reviews before making a first-time purchase online or in-store. In fact, the data shows that pet supplement consumers use a variety of shopping channels and are much more likely than the average pet parent to report shopping on Amazon or Chewy.com. Additionally, mass retail stores, pet specialty stores and pet specialty websites are important channels to this segment of pet parents. Consumers practice intentionality and health-oriented lifestyles Finally, brands will find value in looking at the psychographic profile and everyday lifestyles of pet supplement consumers. The pet supplement audience is highly likely to place importance on self-respect, positive relationships, security, a sense of accomplishment, self-fulfillment, and fun and enjoyment, the data demonstrates. Moreover, pet supplement consumers are more likely than average pet parents to dedicate time to their physical, mental and spiritual health. Getting to know the pet supplement consumer is an ongoing conversation. In many ways, the supplement consumer is very much like the average pet parent, but with a stronger tendency to seek out information on health and wellness from a variety of sources. Oftentimes, they know the specific benefit they want, but also want to be knowledgeable about what they are giving their pets. Without a doubt, the pet supplement consumer audience presents a compelling opportunity. Brands that make the effort to cultivate insights into this group will be well positioned to go to market with compelling pet supplement offerings and capture market share.

In 2019, nearly 5 million human deaths worldwide were associated with bacterial AMR, of which 1.3 million human deaths were directly attributable to bacterial AMR. Each year, the FAO dedicates the week of Nov. 18-24 to raising awareness of the deadly consequences of AMR. The theme of this year’s World Antimicrobial Awareness Week (WAAW) is “Preventing microbial resistance together.” “AMR is a threat to humans, animals, plants and the environment. It affects us all,” the FAO says on its website. “That is why this year's theme calls for cross-sectoral collaboration to preserve the effectiveness of these important medicines.” AMR occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites no longer respond to the antimicrobial agents used against them. As a result, antibiotics and other antimicrobials become ineffective and infections become difficult or impossible to treat, increasing the risk of disease spread, severe illness and death. Antimicrobials and antibiotics have been used for both disease prevention and treatment in humans and in animals, and for improving growth rates in food-producing animals. The misuse and overuse of antimicrobials are accelerating the development and spread of AMR worldwide. The agri-food sector is severely affected by antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, which can lead to economic losses, a decline in livestock production, poverty, hunger and malnutrition across the globe, the FAO said. There has been a global movement in recent years to reduce antimicrobial use in livestock production, in which antimicrobials are used extensively to address gut health issues. Dr. Richard Murphy, research director at Alltech's European Bioscience Centre in Dunboyne, Ireland, said AMR is a persistent problem challenging the industry. He spoke about AMR during a recent Ag Future podcast with Tom Martin. “The agriculture industry has made great strides in moving toward reductions in antibiotic usage, restricting their usage even further. But when you look at the year-on-year data, even though the usage of antimicrobials and antibiotics has decreased, we tend not to see a similar decrease in the prevalence of resistance among pathogens that would have human resonance — E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter,” Dr. Murphy said. As steps are taken to move toward antibiotic-free systems, producers are faced with the dilemma of controlling pathogens and AMR at the same time. “Rather than focusing solely on antimicrobial resistance, we need to focus on the pathogens, because of the high-level prevalence of antimicrobial resistance that's present in those pathogens,” Dr. Murphy said. Alltech’s researchers are focused on trying to understand the link between pathogen control and the control of antimicrobial resistance, he said. They are also focused on how to utilize the gut microflora to control pathogens. “If you can expand the richness and the diversity of the gut microflora, that enables the GI tract to self-police. You tend to get what's known as colonization resistance,” he said. “You get greater resistance to pathogen colonization of the GI tract. We found in multiple studies across multiple species that we can effect changes. We can bring about increases in species richness (and) in gut microflora diversity with the use of mannan-based prebiotics — mannan-rich fraction, for instance.” A path toward antibiotic-free production The use of alternative products designed to regulate and support the gut environment and its microflora will assist the move to antibiotic-free production, said Dr. Jules Taylor-Pickard, director of the Alltech® Gut Health Management platform. Among those products are feed enzymes, organic minerals, yeast-cell wall derivatives such as mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS) and mannose-rich fractions (MRF), functional nutrients and probiotics. Alltech’s Gut Health Management offers a path to antibiotic-free production that begins with its Seed, Feed, Weed program. “Seed, Feed, Weed is just that: It’s seeding the gut with favorable organisms, it’s feeding those favorable organisms and it’s weeding out the unfavorable or the bad organisms,” Dr. Taylor-Pickard explained. The second step is the antibiotic reduction program, through which a team of experts helps develop an action plan to assist producers with reducing antibiotic use on-farm. The goal is to significantly reduce or even make prophylactic (preventative) and metaphylaxis antibiotic use (treating an entire group without evidence of disease) redundant. The third step helps producers with the transition to operating without antibiotics by improving gut health and utilizing holistic nutrition and management practices across all stages of production. There is no “silver bullet” solution for reducing AMR, Dr. Murphy said. It can be quite difficult to develop programs whereby you remove antibiotics and replace them with a single compound or a single nutritional additive. “When we think about replacement of antibiotics, we will need to take into consideration multiple factors or dimensions, such as animal management and facility hygiene; diet certainly is going to be absolutely critical, and nutritional components play a huge role in transitioning away from antibiotic use and in transitioning toward antibiotic-free production systems,” he said. Building a more resilient agri-food system As part of WAAW, the FAO issued calls to action for farmers, food chain workers and consumers, policymakers, animal health and agriculture professionals and others. “The challenges of AMR are complex and multifaceted, but they are not insurmountable,” the organization said. Among its key calls to action during WAAW, the FAO is asking agri-food systems to: Implement prevention measures (biosecurity, sanitation, hygiene, etc.) to reduce the need for antimicrobials in animals and antimicrobial pesticides in plants. Use diagnostic tests to assist surveillance efforts and design successful interventions to reduce AMR. Use science-based evidence to identify, manage and mitigate AMR risks. Improve access to expert advice, prescriptions, appropriate antimicrobials to reduce production and productivity losses, and build more resilient agri-food systems. Provide a system-wide approach to keeping crops healthy, resorting to chemical pesticides only as a last resort. The FAO is challenging policymakers to commit resources to tackle AMR and meet national AMR action plan targets. It is also asking agriculture professionals to share information on best practices for reducing the use of antimicrobials.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/fao-raises-awareness-deadly-consequences-antimicrobial-resistance","title":"\n\n                    FAO raises awareness to deadly consequences of antimicrobial resistance\n                    ","date":"November 18, 2022","contentLength":1049}},{"pageContent":"“Organic chicken,” “free-range chicken” and “antibiotic-free chicken” are now popular terms in the food supply chain. As consumers become more conscious about their health and animal welfare, the poultry industry has been working hard to address their concerns. There has been a particularly strong drive for antibiotic-free (ABF) chicken. As a result, producers, retailers and restaurants have started to offer ABF choices. Governments have also created stricter regulations to prevent the misuse or overuse of antibiotics in animal feed. Why has there been such a strong adjustment from various stakeholders globally around this issue? It all started with consumer concern about antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance is predicted to kill more people than cancer by 2050. This blog post reveals how reducing antibiotic usage in agriculture is being demanded by consumers, required by governments and led by big brands to help prevent this global health threat. For poultry producers, ensuring good animal gut health is important for preventing the disease challenges that come with antibiotic reduction on the farm. The push for antibiotic-free chicken has come from consumers due to health concerns. The majority of antibiotic resistance has resulted from human misuse and the overuse or abuse of antibiotics. However, the public is worried about antibiotic use in agriculture for several reasons: Antibiotics used in farming have also been used in human medicine. Animals can pass resistance to humans through live contact and/or environmental contamination. Meat, milk and eggs from contaminated animals (for example, poultry meat that contains antibiotic-resistant E. coli) can pass resistance to humans. Why is antibiotic resistance scary? Let’s rewind to 1945, when Sir Alexander Fleming won a Nobel Prize for his discovery of penicillin. In his acceptance speech, he warned even then that bacteria could become resistant to drugs. That means that some bacteria meant to be killed by antibiotics can adapt, survive and replicate. Sometimes, they pass this characteristic to other bacteria present in the gut. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is dangerous because it makes treatments fail when people or animals get sick. Fast-forward nearly 80 years and AMR is one of the biggest threats in global health, food security and development today, according to World Health Organization (WHO). In 2019, almost 1.3 million deaths directly resulted from illnesses caused by drug-resistant bugs, according to a report released by the Lancet, a medical journal, on January 20, 2022. The large-scale use of antibiotics could lead to the death of up to 10 million people by 2050, meaning that one life will be taken every three seconds. In other words, superbugs could be a bigger killer than cancer, as projected in the chart below. These alarming statistics reveal an urgent need for sweeping global changes to tackle antibiotic resistance on every front, from the healthcare industry to the agriculture sector. Governments have introduced policies to prevent antibiotic resistance from agriculture. Farmers began putting antibiotics in chicken feed in the 1950s after observing lower mortalities and faster body weight gain associated with their use. While the 1950s and the 1960s were the golden era of antibiotic discoveries, progress slowed down in the following decades, and new antibiotics are not currently being discovered. Meanwhile, bugs have evolved to resist many of the antibiotics available to both humans and animals. Consequently, regulatory boards have become stricter about antibiotics in animal feed. Currently, the main uses of antibiotics in poultry productions are to treat disease, prevent disease or promote growth. The first use must exclude medically important antibiotics for humans in many countries now. The second and third uses are being increasingly restricted, as shown in the timeline below. Denmark is a pioneer in this area and has established creative ways of following up on regulations. For example, Denmark’s government introduced a card system to name and shame drug abusers. This is done by listing the top veterinarians and farms by drug usage, then visiting those farms to ask why they are using so much. With other countries following suit and creating their own rules, the focus on reducing antibiotic use in feed continues to grow globally. Many producers, retailers and restaurant chains have developed ABF food products and menu items to respond to consumer demand. The table below illustrates some examples from the U.S. A holistic approach to ensuring poultry performance and producer profitability with a reduced reliance on antibiotics. Many producers have been successful in making the transition to antibiotic-free production or antibiotic reduction, despite the inevitable challenges. To prevent disease in poultry and promote growth for broiler chicken, it is important to make both the outside and internal environments as beneficial and comfortable as possible for the animal. For the outside environment, it is helpful to have a nutritionist evaluate any environmental factors, such as drinking water and air quality. Biosecurity, farm management and vaccination programs also play an important role in keeping the flock safe. The internal environment is related to gut health, which is directly linked to immunity and growth performance. A complete gut health program like Seed, Feed, Weed (SFW) aids in reducing antibiotic usage in poultry by: Seeding the gut-favorable organisms (i.e., probiotics) Feeding them and maintaining a proper environment in which they can survive Weeding out the unfavorable organisms before they colonize the intestinal tract This helps prevent pathogenic bacteria from binding to the epithelium and works to maintain microbial diversity, which improves the animal’s natural defenses. In conclusion, with alarming predictions on what antibiotic resistance could do to people’s health and livelihood, the poultry industry is taking steps to reduce antibiotic use in animal feed. Many companies and farms have successfully switched to antibiotic-free production or antibiotic reduction in recent years. This shows that alternatives to antibiotics are available to help producers maintain their businesses. Additionally, a sustainable poultry production can also help companies reach a new market and gain a competitive advantage.

The industry continues to grow and contribute to the increasing food supply for human consumption, reaching worldwide production of 80 million metric tons (Mt) in 2016. To sustain its growth, the aquaculture industry is highly dependent on commercial feed sources. The inclusion rate of traditionally used finite and expensive marine protein and fat sources from wild-caught fish (i.e., fishmeal and fish oil) in the diets of farm-raised fish species will continue to decline, and the industry has already shifted to crop-based raw materials to meet the rising demand for aquafeeds. Fish require several carefully chosen raw materials to provide them with a healthy diet, but fish-based proteins are not essential. The industry has recognized this, and there are now many fish feeds with 0% fish-based protein ingredients and an industry average (FIFO Factor). Plant-based feed ingredients increasingly replace marine-based components, and therefore, an enhanced level of understanding of the nutritional quality of raw materials derived from plant sources is becoming increasingly crucial for aquafeeds. Moreover, the higher inclusion of less-expensive plant sources may introduce a series of anti-nutritional factors (e.g., protease inhibitors, phytates, saponins, glucosinolates, tannins, non-starch polysaccharides) and/or increase the occurrence of mycotoxins in fish feed; factors that may affect the quality and safety of aquafeeds. Mycotoxins in aquaculture feed Mycotoxins are fungi that can grow on crops during growth, harvest, processing or storage. The development of these fungi is climate-dependent and most commonly seen in tropical regions. In these climates, the fungi produce chemical compounds known as mycotoxins and can have a greater impact on animal health. Fish farming is a diverse industry, and each aquaculture species will have different sensitivities to the impacts of mycotoxins. These can cause a reduction in performance — reduced growth and increased feed conversion ratio (FCR) — and increased disease susceptibility and mortality rates. As these issues can be attributed to other concerns, the risk can often be overlooked and underestimated in aquaculture. Mycotoxins are mainly detected in plant-based feedstuffs, readily present in corn, wheat and soybean meal. Increasingly, the occurrence of mycotoxins has been reported in aquafeeds. There are over 50 different types of mycotoxins, but the most commonly known and most prevalent is deoxynivalenol (DON). Effects of deoxynivalenol on the health and growth of farmed fish species Accumulation of DON in fish can be harmful and impact their performance. In terms of occurrence and toxicity, DON has been characterized as the most high-risk mycotoxin in aquafeeds. Its effects include: 1. Ribotoxic stress response: DON binds to ribosomes, inducing a “ribotoxic stress response” that activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). 2. Oxidative stress: DON causes oxidative stress in cells by damaging mitochondria function, either through the excessive release of free radicals — including reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce lipid peroxidation — or by decreasing the activity of antioxidant enzymes. 3. Impacting epithelial cells in the digestive tract: Predominantly, rapidly proliferating cells with a high protein turnover, such as immune cells, hepatocytes and epithelial cells of the digestive tract, are affected by DON. 4. Reduced growth rate: In Atlantic salmon diets, 3.7 mg/kg of DON resulted in a 20% reduction in feed intake, an 18% increase in FCR and a 31% reduction in specific growth rate. In white shrimp, DON levels of 0.5 and 1.0 ppm in the diet significantly reduced body weight and growth rate, while FCR and survival were not affected. 5. Decreased immune system response: Mycotoxins impair optimum animal performance by affecting intestinal, organ and immune systems. These, in turn, negatively impact overall performance and profitability. 6. Reduced feed intake: A study conducted by Woodward et al. (1983) showed that rainbow trout had a sharp taste acuity for DON. Their feed intake declined as the concentration of DON increased from 1–13 ppm of the diet, resulting in reduced growth and feed efficiency The impacts will vary on many factors, including the quantity, feeding level, duration of exposure and aquatic species. A recent meta-analysis completed by Koletsi et al. (2021) highlights the risk of DON on feed intake and growth performance. In parallel, data was collected to quantify the risk of exposure in fish. The extent to which DON affects feed intake and growth performance was evaluated by employing a meta-analytical approach. Having completed a full meta-analysis of the current research and trial data available for the aquaculture species, Koletsi et al. concluded that the current recommendation for the limit of DON in fish diets is too high and needs to be reviewed in order to protect the welfare of fish and maintain an economic advantage. Preventing mycotoxins in aquaculture Maintaining a good management system will help to control the mycotoxin risk. However, some mycotoxins remain stable, even after high-temperature extrusion processing. For this reason, additional steps should be taken to mitigate the risk. Alltech mycotoxin management tools, such as Alltech 37+® and Alltech® RAPIREAD, help farmers and feed producers identify their total mycotoxin risk (REQ). Evaluating risks associated with mycotoxins on animal performance and financial losses can be more rapid than ever before.

Since then, the book has been featured twice in the Alltech virtual book club, and hundreds of copies have been given away to Alltech colleagues and friends around the world. The book was written by Hans Rosling in collaboration with his son, Ola Rosling, and his daughter-in-law, Anna Rosling Rönnlund. Together, they founded Gapminder to combat misconceptions and present facts, global trends and data in a way that everybody can understand. Rönnlund is also the founder of Dollar Street, which reflects her own passion for photography by using images and videos to promote a fact-based view of the world. “What if we are wrong about the world?” asked Anna Rosling Rönnlund, the first keynote speaker at ONE this year. “How can we then make sure we do the right things?” What are the facts about what’s happening around the world? The world is full of problems. Climate change and COVID-19 are two hot topics, to name a few. To check whether conference attendees’ worldview was up to date, Rönnlund carried out a short quiz with 18 multiple-choice questions on topics that varied from suicide to low-income countries, farming and plastic waste. You can take the quiz here. The following facts are true: 1. The suicide rate decreased by 25% over the past 20 years. 2. 9% of countries are low-income countries now. 3. 6% of plastic waste ends up in the ocean. Below are the results of ONE participant responses comparing to the facts: On average, attendees only answered 4.7 of the 18 questions correctly. The results demonstrated that our perspective of the world is often not based on facts and, as a result, can cloud our judgment. What causes a skewed worldview? Rönnlund gave three explanations for how misconceptions are often generated: 1 .The things we learned in school have become outdated. 2. What we see around us is a narrow slice of reality. 3. The news is overdramatic — we only hear about extraordinary events, instead of things like, “Yesterday, all trains were on time again.” How can we update our worldview? 1. Get a reality check. To broaden our horizon and see the truth about ordinary things, Rönnlund suggested that we pay attention to what’s happening in reality as well. “We need to look at how people really sleep, how they brush their teeth, where they go to the toilet even,” said Rönnlund. “We need to see that everyday reality (in order) to understand that most of us are having everyday struggles that look pretty much the same, even though we might be in different countries and on different income levels.” You can see pictures of items and activities from households with different income levels around the world here. 2. Look at the data. “But that (seeing everyday reality) is not enough. We also need to look at the data,” Rönnlund noted before sharing 32 things that have improved in the world over time. For example, legal slavery has decreased dramatically, deaths due to disasters have all but disappeared, fewer children are dying, more kids are getting vaccinated and there are more movies to choose from. “So, a lot of things are actually improving, but we’re very bad at seeing these slow trends on a global level,” said Rönnlund. “Instead, we see the media, and we see the drama all around us.” The world is, in so many ways, getting better. However, there are still many problems to solve. The danger of being wrong about data and global trends is that we might end up solving the wrong problems — or solving them in the wrong order. 3. Trick your brain. Even when we are highly educated and know the facts, the world keeps changing. In addition, our brains love dramatic stories more than the truth about global trends. We need to trick our brains to be smarter without spending too much time learning. With this in mind, the authors of “Factfulness” developed the 10 Rules of Thumb to control the dramatic instincts in our minds. What are the 10 Factfulness Rules of Thumb? 1. The Gap Instinct: We tend to think about the world as divided, such as either poor or rich. The majority, however, is in the middle. 2. The Negativity Instinct: Our brains might think things keep getting worse because of what we hear, but sometimes, we should ask ourselves: Would an improvement get publicity? 3. The Straight Line Instinct: When we see a trend, we tend to think it will continue. However, many lines bend. 4. The Fear Instinct: Often, we see and search for stories that are dramatic and interesting, but our brains overdramatize reality. 5. The Size Instinct: Everything we hear on a global level seems to be huge because the numbers add up. But we need to compare, divide and put things in perspective. 6. The Generalization Instinct: For example, we tend to group people together and think they are all the same, even if they have different backgrounds. 7. The Destiny Instinct: Thinking that nothing can be done because of destiny is a bad ground for doing change work. 8. The Single Instinct: We tend to think that we have a hammer, and we want to use it on everything we see. To make smart decisions, however, we need to use a toolbox. 9. The Blame Instinct: This is our instinct of pointing fingers at certain people, forcing them to bear the guilt for things going bad. 10. The Urgency Instinct: We often feel the urge to do something big immediately upon hearing about dramatic events happening around us. “There is a risk of doing the wrong thing and doing too much of it, which might cause problems rather than fix them,” said Rönnlund. “What we need to do is to take one step at a time and keep evaluating and keep looking at it.” How can we support a fact-based view of the world? 1. Foster data literacy by providing transparent and free data. 2. Make the world more understandable by visualizing data, especially in schools. “We need to serve the brain enough excitement so it’s interested enough to keep listening, and (we should) stay true to the facts and ensure we are not overexaggerating anything,” advised Rönnlund. 3. Be humble and curious. “You don't want to be looked at as someone who’s … wrong, but according to the testing we have done, we’ve seen that most people are wrong in most industries, in most ages, in most educational levels,” shared Rönnlund. “I think, if we are humble and curious and start looking for the data, we will find data, because it is existing.” 4. Keep upgrading our worldview, because the world keeps changing, and so do the facts about it. A lot of data is freely available from big organizations online. “We need to foster this new habit with curiosity and humility, looking for facts, and keep updating them,” said Rönnlund. “It’s not a small thing, because it’s about rewiring the way we think as a species, but I think we have to start doing it.” 5. Beware of unreliable data. Most information around us is not fake, but we get it wrong anyway. We also now have to deal with fake news. Be sure to check your sources. 6. Reach out beyond your network. When it comes to social media, look for friends of your friends or distant relatives to widen your point of view. Explore other fields of interest to broaden your understanding of how people see things differently. Fun facts from the Q&A session Rönnlund started writing “Factfulness” with her husband, Ola, and father-in-law, Hans, after the three of them worked closely together on Gapminder for more than 10 years to make the world easier to understand. Their collaboration began after a family dinner, where Hans shared his struggle to explain global health to medical students. At first, Rönnlund and Ola helped Hans simplify the information by creating more appealing visuals. Then, together, they started to innovate and find better ways to teach global health and development to a bigger audience. The three authors wrote about five big risks for the future in “Factfulness,” and the number-one risk was a global pandemic. People can be happy with what they know about the world, and it’s hard to change or upgrade that knowledge. The writers focused on two things: first, what people are most often wrong about, which they determined by screening populations with factual questions, and second, why we have such a hard time understanding the world around us, which they explored by looking at the brain. Rönnlund and Ola are continuing Hans’ legacy by creating new content and new factual questions so that people can stay updated on different topics. They are working to create more teaching materials that can be used in the classroom. “Factfulness is recognizing that a single perspective can limit your imagination,” said Dr. Lyons in the conclusion of the session. “And remember that it is better to look at problems from many different angles. When we see the world in this way, we truly become possible-ists, people who can really see clearly how progress can be made, the potential ahead, and make sure that we can play a role in making it better.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.

Here is a fall to-do list to get you started: 1. Review your lighting needs. During the winter, horse owners often have no choice but to feed both the morning and evening meals in the dark. As such, having indoor as well as outdoor lighting will help immensely with chore efficiency. Make sure you have enough light to weigh your hay and to ensure that you’re feeding quality hay that is mold-free and green. Cleaning paddocks and staying mud-free will be easier if there’s outdoor lighting so you can see the manure. Additionally, providing solar lighting along walkways or drives will help make nighttime travels safer. Prepare the proper lighting now, instead of waiting until the temperatures are freezing and you have to feed by flashlight, set up lighting in frozen ground or hang outside lights in sub-zero temperatures. 2. Consider your winter equipment needs. The simple items are often the most beneficial — for example, a headlamp that frees up your hands for outside evening chores, like filling stock water tanks, or is handy in case of power outages. If winter storms are likely in your region, make sure you have fuel for your generators and cook stoves and batteries for your lanterns on hand. Manure carts that can push through snow (thanks to their higher clearance and wider tires), along with a sturdy manure fork, might also be useful. We like to keep a metal pitchfork and flat metal shovel on hand in case we need to chip away at frozen manure piles for removal. 3. Set up a water supply that won’t freeze or get ice-cold during winter weather events. A horse drinks 8 to 12 gallons of water per day and prefers water temperatures of around 45 to 65 degrees. Horses drink less when the water is ice-cold, and research shows that they cannot get adequately hydrated by solely eating snow. Inadequate water intake can lead to colic, so make sure your horses are drinking enough. On very cold days, plan to break the ice twice daily — or consider getting a tank heater, a plug-in heated stall bucket or a heated muck bucket for the water. 4. Develop a back-up plan for watering your horses. If you are concerned that you might lose power to your private well and/or you live in an area that often loses power you should have a back-up plan. Water can be stored in rain barrels or garbage cans. Emergency officials generally recommend keeping a three-day supply of water on hand, which translates to a minimum of 30 gallons of water per horse. 5. Check your turnout blankets. Look for rips or other needed mending or washing so they will be ready for use when you need them. Blanketing horses appropriately in the winter is key for their ability to maintain body heat during cold weather. 6. Consider your own wintertime, water-proof clothing needs. This is a fundamental but often overlooked step. As a horse owner, if there’s an emergency, you are likely to be working with horses in inclement weather for an undetermined amount of time. Invest in a good, waterproof jacket, insulated mud boots and insulated, waterproof gloves. These items will go a long way toward helping you stay ahead of your winter chores and will also be crucial if there’s a winter emergency. You are no good to your horses if you become hypothermic and have a medical emergency yourself. 7. Flood-proof your property. If you live in a flood-prone area (e.g., near a creek, river or wetlands), it is good to review the high-water locations on your property. If it is difficult to visualize or determine where they are, get help from your county or your local conservation district. Acquaint yourself with the historic high-water locations recorded for your property. If you live in an extremely flood-prone area, it may be wise to consider building a “critter pad.” A critter pad is a large mound or small hill that’s built above flood level and is used to keep animals out of water. Critter pads usually require special permitting and must be specifically engineered using the approved fill material to ensure that they can stand up to high traffic, heavy rains and high volumes of water – and, of course, that they will remain above flood levels. In some cases, there may be funding or technical assistance available to help with the development of a critter pad. Contact your local conservation district, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for more assistance. 8. Check your gutters and downspouts. Now is the time to clean and make needed repairs or additions to your roof runoff system. Doing this will benefit you and your horse by reducing the amount of mud your horse will have to stand in during the winter. It will also make chore time easier. “Keep clean rainwater clean,” as they say, by diverting rainwater away from your paddocks and high-traffic areas to a location where it won’t get muddy. Some good choices include grassy swales, dry wells, rain barrels, stock watering tanks, well-vegetated woods or an unused portion of your pasture. 9. Determine if you need footing for any of your confinement areas. These areas get a lot of heavy use during winter and can often benefit from being bolstered with additional footing material. Footing — usually coarse-washed sand or crushed rock (no larger than 1 inch) — is generally the best choice and is also the easiest to clear of manure. Having 3 to 6 inches of footing material for horses to stand on will help with drainage and mud management and will also help eliminate erosion. Taking these steps this fall will not only make your life easier come winter, but it will also contribute to your horse’s health all year long.

Cases of H5N1 HPAI have been confirmed in many countries and various regions of Asia, Europe and North America, affecting both the commercial and wild bird populations. Thus far, more than 31 million birds have been culled this year in an effort to try to prevent the further spread of the current avian influenza (AI) virus outbreak. In this article, you will learn more about the signs and symptoms of AI, some best practices to help prevent the spread of AI, and several recommended actions to take and resources to turn to if your flock tests positive for avian influenza. Signs and symptoms of avian influenza in poultry Avian influenza is a disease caused by influenza type-A viruses, which can infect both wild and domestic birds. Several factors can contribute to the spread of AI, such as migratory bird flight patterns, international trade and human-wild bird points of cross-contact. AI is more commonly detected in colder regions due to the resilience of the virus in low to freezing temperatures. There are two clinical types of influenza virus in poultry: highly pathogenic (HP) and low-pathogenic (LP). The HP strains of bird flu can spread rapidly among poultry flocks and may cause multi-organ failure and sudden high mortality levels. The LP strains of bird flu form as asymptomatic infections, respiratory disease and/or drops in production. Symptoms indicating the presence of avian flu in birds include: Sudden death without any warning signs Purple discoloration of the wattles, comb and legs Swollen head, eyelids, comb, wattles and hocks Soft-shelled or misshapen eggs Decreased egg production Lack of energy, appetite and coordination Diarrhea Nasal discharge Coughing or sneezing Ruffled feathers How to help prevent avian influenza in poultry Avian influenza viruses spread through direct contact with infected birds or through contaminated feed, water, equipment and clothing. Therefore, biosecurity is the first and most important method of prevention at the farm level. For poultry producers to prevent the introduction of the virus to their ﬂock, they are advised to: 1. Reduce wildlife attractants: Remove standing water: Grade your property to avoid the pooling of water. Avoid walking or moving equipment near standing water used by wildlife. Reduce food sources: Do not feed wildlife. Locate your feeding structures on a clean pad. Have quick clean-ups for the feed storage area. Mow frequently and remove fallen fruits. Cover waste: Do not pile used litter near barns. Close dumpsters properly. Keep carcasses covered. 2. Prevent wildlife access: Install exclusionary netting, screens and perch deterrents, like repellent gel or bird spikes. 3. Add wildlife deterrents: Move and replace scare devices frequently. 4. Keep birds away from areas frequented by wildfowl: Keep your birds indoors during high-risk times. If they cannot go indoors, make sure wild birds cannot access their feed and water sources. 5. Cover your run: Protect housed birds that may be able to have contact with wild birds, such as smallholding flocks in outdoor runs. 6. Maintain control over the access of people and equipment to poultry houses: If infected wild birds are in the area, reduce the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry are kept. Change your clothes before and after contact with your flock, and ensure that any visitors do the same. 7. Maintain sanitation of the property, poultry houses, equipment, vehicles and footwear: Disinfect regularly. For commercial poultry owners, clean and disinfect your housing at the end of a production cycle. Wash your hands thoroughly before and after contact with birds. 8. Avoid the introduction of birds of unknown disease status into the ﬂock: Only acquire birds from sources that can verify that they are disease-free. Then, quarantine new birds for two weeks in separate quarters to ensure that they are healthy. 9. Report illnesses and bird deaths: Contact a vet if you have any concerns. Taking action quickly will help protect other flocks in the area if the disease is confirmed. 10. Appropriately dispose of manure and dead poultry: Follow local guidelines regarding depopulation and disposal methods. 11. Maintain surveillance: At a minimum, follow local regulations regarding breeder flock monitoring and testing protocols. Best practices to help prevent the spread of AI Treatment with antiviral compounds is not approved or recommended for AI. It is best to have a monitoring system in place and to implement biosecurity measures as prevention against this virus. Each country has a specific AI protocol in place, but in general, the policy is to humanely and safely cull the affected flock and enhance the biosecurity measures of the operation. When formulating a culling policy, the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) recommends: The humane destruction of all infected and exposed animals. The appropriate disposal of carcasses and all animal products. Surveillance and tracing of potentially infected or exposed poultry. Strict quarantine and controls on the movement of poultry and any at-risk vehicles. The thorough decontamination of the infected premises. A period of at least 21 days before restocking. Following all local and national guidelines. Vaccination can be a powerful tool to support eradication programs if used in conjunction with other control methods. Using emergency vaccinations to decrease the transmission rate could provide an alternative to preemptive culling, reducing the susceptibility of healthy flocks at risk of contracting the virus. According to the USDA Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS), the typical steps to take when concerned with a potential avian influenza outbreak are: Find: Detect, report and confirm the disease. It is important to monitor each flock closely when an AI outbreak is present in the surrounding area. If signs of AI are detected, it is important to notify the USDA or your state veterinarian immediately. The USDA will then test samples to confirm if there is a positive case of AI and will provide more information regarding the specific strain and follow-up protocols. Respond: Quarantine, depopulate, compensate and dispose. If a location has tested positive for avian influenza, only authorized workers are allowed in and out of the facility. All movements of birds, poultry products and equipment are restricted to avoid cross-contamination between flocks. The birds are usually depopulated within 24 to 48 hours of testing positive and are disposed of shortly thereafter. Recover: Clean, test and restock. When the houses are empty, you must thoroughly clean and disinfect them, along with any equipment and other potentially affected areas. The house must then stay empty for an extended period of time, which varies depending on the species of bird. The USDA collects samples and tests to ensure that the AI virus has been eliminated, and a period of vacancy is required before new birds can be placed. Did you know? Although avian influenza A viruses do not typically infect people, rare cases of human infection with these viruses have been reported after unprotected contact with infected birds or surfaces contaminated with avian influenza viruses (CDC, 2017). H5N1 is a highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus. It can be deadly for poultry and humans. The first human case occurred in 1997. Since November 2003, H5N1 has killed more than 50% of the people who have been infected with it (WHO, 2020). H7N9 bird flu is rated by the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool as having the greatest potential to cause a pandemic, as well as potentially posing the most significant risk to severely impact public health if it were to achieve sustained human-to-human transmission. Humans are usually infected through close contact with infected birds. Birds shed the influenza virus in their saliva, feces and mucous. Therefore, contact with bird droppings is also a possible transmission route.

They have the foresight to combat the inevitable stresses and other challenges their cattle will face. They know that weaning, transportation and other prolonged periods of stress can have a negative impact on immune function and, ultimately, the performance of their animals. So they act to mitigate that stress and, in turn, any health problems their beef cattle are facing. They know that prevention is cheaper than treatment, and they want to see their cattle thrive. Preventative health management practices are key for healthy cattle. Vaccinations and nutrition have a symbiotic relationship in terms of maintaining healthy immune functions in cattle. While quality nutritional programs are the bedrock of healthy immune function, both nutritional and vaccination programs are important for successful preventative health management on a cattle operation. Preventative health management focuses on promoting an animal’s natural immunity and minimizing the negative growth responses associated with stress and other health challenges. The role of vaccination Vaccinating your cattle stimulates their immune systems to produce antibodies that specifically work to combat disease-causing viruses or bacteria. After vaccination, a healthy immune response should translate to a memory of those specific pathogens for the immune system. This memory ensures a rapid response if the animal is exposed to pathogens it has been vaccinated against and allows the animal to avoid infection. Disease challenges vary between different geographies, so it is important to work with your local veterinarian to develop vaccine protocols, as they can identify and walk through the specific needs of your operation. Although your needs may vary based on your herd and geography, there are a few vaccines that we typically consider crucial for beef cattle, such as a scours vaccine and vaccinating for the bovine respiratory syncytial virus. Implementing a beef vaccination schedule While vaccination is generally important, establishing a well-constructed beef cattle vaccination schedule is crucial for vaccine success. One part of that plan — that is, the timing — can make the difference between failure and success. Vaccinations should be timed so that peak levels of antibodies are present when the animal is at the highest risk of infection. Keep in mind that peak levels of antibodies take several weeks to manifest following vaccination, so you’ll want to plan ahead. The stage of the production cycle will determine the type and timing of the vaccine. Pre-calving: A scours vaccination should happen during late gestation so that the highest levels of antibodies are present in the colostrum. A new calf’s immune system is weak, leaving it susceptible to disease and reliant on colostrum to provide it with much-needed antibodies and protection. Pre-breeding: For added protection for replacement heifers and cows, it might make sense to implement a pre-breeding vaccination protocol. This should be done around 45 days before you are hoping to breed. Bulls: Keeping your bulls protected may mean implementing an annual vaccination program. Similar to your cows and replacement heifers, these vaccinations may be most effective for bulls around 45 days before breeding. Weaned calves: Vaccinations should be given a couple of weeks before weaning so that peak antibody protection is achieved during feedlot arrival. With weaning, transportation, a new environment and mingling with a new group, this time in a calf’s life is the perfect storm for sickness. Vaccination provides calves with some protection as they start this new stage of their lives. These programs and protocols are only as effective as they are managed. Poor animal health status at vaccination, improper vaccine handling and inadequate nutritional status can all lead to vaccine failure. A failed vaccine costs more than just the amount of product you had in the syringe; it can lead to loss of gain or even death throughout an entire group of calves. Likewise, it is important to understand that vaccines do not guarantee 100% protection and may only provide protection for a period. Even so, can we increase the effectiveness of the vaccine through proper nutrition? The role of nutrition Meeting an animal's nutritional requirements is essential for the proper development, maintenance and function of its immune system. Among the other health benefits good nutrition provides, it can also bolster the effectiveness of vaccines and provide longer-lasting protection for cattle. To achieve a nutritional status that supports immune responses, a cattle nutrition program must include energy, protein, trace minerals and vitamins. Energy: Immune responses require an abundance of energy. When cattle are exposed to a disease, their immune systems work hard. In terms of the energy hierarchy, an immune response comes before maintenance and production energy. However, shifting energy to the immune response will decrease the nutrients available for growth or maintenance and can cause a reduction in body condition in dams and reduce growth in feedlot animals. Protein: Proteins are used to produce antibodies. Since the goal of vaccination is to increase the production of antibodies, a protein deficiency can result in substandard antibody production. As with energy, shifting protein from growth to immune function can negatively impact animal performance. Trace minerals and vitamins: The amount of trace minerals and vitamins needed in the diet varies based on the age, role and geography of the cattle, but both vitamins and minerals play an essential role in immune function. Deficiencies in one or more of these nutrients can lead to reduced antibody production. Nutritional needs at different life stages Just like with vaccines, the nutritional needs of your cattle will vary based on your specific herd and geography. Factors that can contribute to the nutrition discussion on your operation include the type of facilities your cattle have access to, the feedstuffs used and whether your cattle have experienced health issues in the past. The most important factor, though, is the current life stage of your cattle, as this will dictate the most basic nutritional needs that should be met. Newborn calves: As mentioned above, calves are born with a high susceptibility to disease, requiring them to rely on colostrum to acquire those all-important antibodies. Calves should have a healthy gut from the very start so that they can better absorb the nutrients in colostrum and, as they transition to creep feed, maximize their potential for big gains. Weaned calves: Maintaining a healthy gut in your calves through weaning is crucial to supporting their gastrointestinal integrity, aiding in vaccine success during the receiving period and keeping them healthy in high-stress situations. Cows: The needs of the cows in your herd can vary based on their age and their current stage in the production cycle. Depending on the forage quality, cows may need mineral supplementation for optimum health, immune function and reproductive success. Herd vaccination programs require an investment of both time and money, and quality nutrition is essential to safeguarding your investment. Talk with your veterinarian about putting together a solid vaccination and nutrition program for your operation.

In his 10 years at the company, Polman led Unilever to double its revenues while reducing the company’s environmental impact by half. He has been described by the Financial Times as “a standout CEO of the past decade.” Today, he works to accelerate action by businesses to achieve the UN Global Goals, which he helped developed. Polman recently co-wrote a book titled “Net Positive: How Courageous Companies Thrive by Giving More Than They Take”. He joined the Alltech ONE Conference (ONE) virtually to share how organizations can transform themselves to achieve big goals by serving the world. “It really is about making a business model where you can show that you profit from solving the world’s problems, not creating them,” advised Polman. “And when you can honestly answer the question, ‘Is the world better off because your business is in it?’” The world needs business to step up “What was very clear during the financial crisis, to me, (was) that we missed an opportunity to address the two most burning issues that science points us to: climate change and inequality,” said Polman. He sees the increases in disparity, natural disasters and diseases as the cost of our failures. Polman went on to explain that if we put the planet’s age of 4.6 billion years old on a scale of 46 years: Human beings have only been around for four hours. The Industrial Revolution only started one minute ago. In that one minute, we’ve cut down 50% of the world’s forests. “You can’t have infinite growth on a finite planet,” Polman said. “Anything you can’t do forever is, by definition, unsustainable.” For many companies, corporate social responsibility (CSR) commitments are about less plastics in the ocean, fewer carbon emissions and less deforestation. But in a world that has overshot its boundaries so much, Polman argued that “less bad” is still bad. “So, the only way of thinking is really to think restorative, reparative, regenerative,” he continued. “And that is what we call ‘net positive’.” Net positive is not about doing less harm. It’s about doing more good. According to Polman, a change needs to happen well beyond the scale of the Industrial Revolution. Increasingly, CEOs are required to be broader social leaders and to partner up within and beyond the industry level. Many CEOs are struggling to make change — and that is normal. The good news, however, is that the greatest challenges also present the greatest business opportunities. “We are at the point confirmed by study after study (where) the cost of not acting is becoming higher than the cost of acting,” said Polman, “which actually makes it an enormous economic opportunity to create this greener, more inclusive, more resilient future and not go back to the past where we came from, which, frankly, had run out of steam.” Helping the world is good for business Polman noted three opportunities for businesses who step up: Being highly valued in the financial market: Doing right by stakeholders is good for shareholders. Companies focusing on environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance get higher returns in the market. Attracting the best talent and increasing engagement: Gen Z and millennials are looking for purposeful companies to work for, where they can make a bigger difference than themselves and work on something that improves the state of the world. Getting economic benefits from using sustainable technology: Moving all supply chains to sustainable supply chains can reduce costs by 9–16%, according to a study by Boston Consulting Group (BCG). In food and agriculture, farmers are using precision farming, artificial intelligence (AI) and renewable energy to provide food to people in a sustainable way. “Planetary health (and) regenerative agriculture … are, by all means, possible,” said Polman. “We see economic benefits coming through as well.” Key takeaways from Unilever’s transformation For business leaders who wants to embark upon the path to net positive, Polman shared the following tips: 1. Think long-term When Polman came to Unilever, he did something unusual in the business world: He stopped providing quarterly earnings reports to focus on a long-term strategy that would benefit all stakeholders. Within 10 years, Unilever saw a 300% shareholder return and a 19% return on investment capital, outgrowing their competitive set. This reconciled the need for shareholder returns. “People often behave short-term because of the boundaries that are put around them,” said Polman. “It’s clear that the issues like climate change or inequality or food securities or these enormous opportunities out there can really not be solved in the rat race of short-term reporting.” 2. Have an aligned purpose “Our first step was really to define that purpose, to get our people behind that,” Polman recalled. “You cannot run a purposeful company if you are not purposeful yourself.” Unilever spent a year working to find out everyone’s personal purpose before collectively developing the company purpose: making sustainable living commonplace. This paid homage to their co-founder, Lord William Lever, who wanted to make good hygiene common practice in the 19th century. To drive performance, Polman introduced “3+1,” where three objectives aligned across the company and one objective was about personal development. Unilever started to build true momentum when its purpose-driven brands were more profitable and growing faster than others. Those brands included the likes of Lifebouy, a bar soap with the mission to help children reach the age of five when 4 million children die every year of infectious diseases. That brand has grown by double digits and has more than doubled in size over 10 years, when it was previously a dying brand. 3. Setting aggressive, net-positive goals “Once we decided that we wanted to make sustainable living commonplace, we also felt that we needed to take responsibility for our total impact in the world,” said Polman. Unilever started to measure its impact in terms of water, waste, carbon emissions and livelihoods. The company wanted to decouple their growth with an environmental impact and increase their overall social impact. Unilever set 50 targets in building a multi-stakeholder model, including: Improving the health and well-being of 1 billion people Creating 5 million jobs for smallholder farmers Running zero-waste factories The company made these goals public. For Polman, transparency drives trust, and trust is the basis of prosperity. Being trusted attracted the needed partnerships that opened up many business opportunities for Unilever. 4. Create partnerships Business cannot thrive in a society that fails. “Net positive” is about driving the broader systems changes that society needs. No company can do this alone — but in partnering up with each other, as well as with civil society and governments, businesses can drive bigger transformations. Unilever worked with numerous other companies (including its competitors), as well as governments and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in its effort to improve the well-being of people and the planet. This built credibility for the company. Consequently, Polman earned the only seat at the table as a private-sector representative on the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) working group in 2013. In concluding his virtual talk at ONE, Polman emphasized the important role that agri-business plays in creating a thriving world for all. “I think what you (Alltech) are doing and what you are referring to as the Planet of Plenty™ is an important vision where you bring together the key principles of consumer health, environmental health and also animal health — where you leverage, obviously, very important technology, where you call out the importance of sustainable farm management, where partnership is engraved very high in your philosophy,” Polman said. “These are all key elements.” “I could not think of a more important industry for the integral parts of health or people and planet — what we call planetary health — probably than this industry that you represent,” he continued. “The implementation of the [United Nations] Sustainable Development Goals, I would argue, is in the hands of the people that control our food and land-use systems. And that’s why it’s so important that we talk today.” To register for access to on-demand content and more from the Alltech ONE Conference, visit one.alltech.com.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/4-key-takeaways-unilevers-path-toward-net-positive","title":"\n\n                    4 key takeaways from Unilever’s path toward net positive\n                    ","date":"May 22, 2022","contentLength":1398}},{"pageContent":"“Mom, where are the baby boomers, where are the millennials? You can’t leave this (climate) crisis all on our shoulders … We are running out of time,” Heather White’s teenage daughter said tearfully to her at the dinner table one day in 2019. White, who has been a noted environmentalist for 20-plus years, recalled the moment during her keynote presentation at the Alltech ONE Conference (ONE). At that moment, she decided to dig into the mental health impact of the climate crisis and create an opportunity for more people to see themselves within the movement. “The climate crisis is the biggest challenge of our time,” White said at ONE. “Everyone is needed, and everyone is welcome. But … it’s so overwhelming, most people don’t know where to start.” Here are the three steps you can take right now to contribute to the climate movement: Step 1: Think beyond your age and listen First, White argues, it is important to think about the people who created opportunity for you — someone who might no longer be here but who changed the trajectory of your life. Our ancestors were intentional in trying to create a better legacy for us, and we can become good ancestors for the next generation, too. Now, envision that it’s 2050. What would a teenager in 2050 thank you for? White invites everyone to listen to young people about their climate concerns and also to give them hope. “We need to be intentional and share with them about the progress that we’ve witnessed in our lifetime so they know that change, hope and progress is not only possible, but that it is inevitable,” White asserted. “That’s on us, and that happens with conversations.” We all have a role to play in climate change, and White helps people find the roles they were meant to play. Step 2: Find your unique role With two decades of environmental advocacy work and national nonprofit leadership to draw from, White wrote a book titled “One Green Thing: Discover Your Hidden Power to Help Save the Planet”. In that book, she created the Service Superpower Profile Assessment, which is similar to a personality test that you can take for free here. “This is an assessment that asks you, ‘Who are you in service? How do you show up for the people that you love?’” White explained. After taking the assessment, you will find yourself among the following seven service types based on which one best suits your personality and talents: The adventurer loves the physicality of the outdoors. They are a calculated risk taker. They love taking other people outside their comfort zone. The beacon is all about social justice. They are comfortable behind the podium. They are visionaries who can see what’s possible. The influencer is about bringing people together and connecting them. The philanthropist is the giver who gives their time and resources and connects other people to causes they care about. The sage focuses on the spiritual connection to nature and the moral case for acting on behalf of the future generation. They can break through the political divide and find common ground for people to see the bigger picture. The spark is the cheerleader who ignites the movement and is always ready to cheer on friends and family. The wonk loves science, policy, data and graphs. They can translate complex technology into solutions people can understand and rally around. “The point of these different seven personality types in service is this idea that you don’t have to do it all,” White assured the audience at ONE. “You can manage to your strengths and contribute to the movement based on your strengths. First and foremost, it is not about perfection. It’s about progress.” Step 3: Apply the daily practice of sustainability Now that you know what your service superpower is, it’s time to save the world. This is where one green thing — a daily sustainability practice — comes in. Start by making a 21-day plan filled with activities you want to do that are fun for you and good for the planet. If you need inspiration or you’re just curious, learn more about your service superpower and matching climate actions here. Follow your plan for 21 days. If you need motivation, reflect on how you want to show up for the people you love, then dedicate a time on your daily schedule. Keep your daily habit of one green thing after the 21 days. “Individual action shifts the culture,” White said. “You are the influencer in your community. Because the reality is (that) all the solutions to the climate crisis exist right now. What is missing is the political will. And the political will only happens when every single one of us acts every day to shift that culture.” With her experience in lobbying for environmental policy on Capitol Hill, White advises that we must create cultural change for policy to work and for market solutions to be adopted at scale.

You know that mice can carry diseases, some of which can be seriously harmful for humans. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), mice and rats can directly or indirectly transmit over 20 diseases worldwide. Several of these — such as leptospirosis and salmonellosis — are contagious to horses as well. And what about the summertime moles and gophers in your pasture, which make a mess of things with their tell-tale piles of dirt? Rodent control is one of the toughest issues to deal with on horse properties. These animals are small and stealthy and are primarily active after dark, when we can’t see them. So, how do you go about reducing the rodent population without resorting to lethal trapping methods or using chemicals that are deadly to other animals in the ecosystem, including dogs and barn cats? Using barn cats as the primary means of rodent control is often not effective and comes with its own set of challenges. For one, horse barns have much to offer to rodents in terms of food, water and shelter, and due to rodents’ small size and rapid cycle of reproduction, cats may not be able to control the rodent populations on their own. Additionally, while cats are worthy additions to the barn, they are at a much higher risk for developing infectious diseases or acquiring parasites and require more health and veterinary care than we often realize. All of the reasons outlined above explain why rodent control in barns should involve more than just our feline friends. Enter nature’s mousetrap: the barn owl! Barn owls are perfectly suited for horse properties, as they hunt in open meadows and grasslands. These creatures of the night have excellent low-light vision; they fly silently; they are equipped with sharp beaks and powerful talons; and their hearing is extraordinary — all of which makes them death on wings for gophers, rats and mice. A family of barn owls will consume about 2,000 mice and/or other rodents in just a few months. The good news for you is that all this method of rodent control requires on your end is the installation of a simple barn owl nest box — and creating the right habitat for their prey. Barn owls need rough grassland to thrive, because that’s where voles, shews, field mice and other small rodents live. An overgrazed pasture, a lawn or even monoculture croplands won’t provide the diverse habitat that rodents like. Rodents — and, therefore, barn owls — favor well-established, tall grasslands (think prairies or meadows), perhaps with brush piles or hedgerows nearby. Barn owls are secondary cavity dwellers, which means they live in holes that somebody else has already created — for example, a hole pecked by a woodpecker in an old tree or the dark rafters inside a quiet barn. We can take advantage of this habitat preference, as it means that these creatures will adapt well to barn owl nest boxes, which can be purchased or made. Place your barn owl nest box in a quiet location, preferably 10 to 20 feet off the ground. Position the opening away from direct sunlight and prevailing winds. Nest boxes can be hung inside unused barns, on the outside of farm buildings or in trees. If the boxes are mounted on a wooden pole, consider utilizing a baffle, which will help keep cats, raccoons or other predators from reaching it. Many barn owls will reuse the same nest box year after year. It is best to hang nest boxes by January or February, as barn owls begin nesting in late February. You’ll be hard-pressed to find an easier rodent control method than the nest box. Once you install your barn owl nest box, nature will do the rest. Additionally, barn owls are not likely to be aggressive toward people, nor will they attack pets or livestock. Barn owls are common on every continent in the world (except for Antarctica), so no matter where you are, your horse property can benefit from having a barn owl working to your advantage. And not only will the presence of barn owls make a dent in your rodent population, but their tawny colors are beautiful to see at dusk, and their bone-chilling, screechy cry is thrilling to hear at night. In addition to setting up barn owl habitats, consider implementing these other natural rodent control methods: Keep your barn clean, well-lit and dry. Store feed in tightly sealed metal trash bins. Store blankets, wraps and saddle pads in completely sealed rooms to minimize access to nesting materials. Remember: Rodent control is a year-long management practice. Follow these steps to help ensure that your barn remains rodent-free through every season.

Her unique approach to working with her clients to develop a comprehensive marketing strategy for their small and medium-sized businesses has earned her multiple awards and international recognition. The Alltech ONE Conference was lucky to have Rhea speak virtually all the way from Europe about 10 strategic marketing tips for social media. While Rhea focuses on equine businesses, her philosophies apply to any brand that is looking to expand their online presence. #1: Find your people. As Rhea reminds us, “Social media is not about you. It’s about ‘them’ and how you can serve them better.” As such, the first step to meeting your social media business goals is to do some market research and figure out where your audience hangs out online. It seems obvious, but simply asking people where they spend their time and observing your audience out in the real world will help you identify which social platforms will make the most sense for who you want to interact with online. #2: Define your objective for each platform. In the words of Zig Ziglar, “You need a plan to build a house. To build a life, it is even more important to have a plan or goal.” We would add to this that to build a social media following, you need to have concrete goals. Each social media platform is different. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, LinkedIn, Twitter — the list goes on, but what most of us know is that each platform serves different purposes and audiences. Before jumping into content creation, decide how you want to use each platform where you have a presence, and create content according to the audience you are serving on that particular site. #3: Post with intention. Science has found that the average person currently processes as much as 74 GB of information per day through all different types of media. This is equivalent to watching 16 movies per day! For reference, 500 years ago, 74 GB of information would have been what a highly educated person consumed in a lifetime. And every year, the amount of information we process daily is estimated to increase by 5%. So, what does this mean for social media? It is easy for brands to get lost in the noise. When you post, don’t do it just to fill space. Have intention behind what you post, and use your platform to make a difference. Understanding the purpose behind each post is critical. Rhea suggests asking yourself what you are trying to achieve with each post. Here are some examples: Engagement Education Inspiration Excitement Entertainment And more! #4: Create quality content. It is important to differentiate yourself and your brand by creating content that is as good as it can be. In Rhea’s words, “Be on a constant quest for improvement.” If your image is what makes people stop, your caption is what drives engagement. Don’t skimp on any part of your content; it is all important for long-term growth on social media channels. #5: Be consistent. Rhea suggests thinking of your social media like a TV show. Remember the days when recording a show and rewatching it later were simply not an option? You knew that every week, on Thursday nights at 8 p.m., your show would come on — and you would show up for it, running to get snacks during the commercials! If you are not consistently showing up on social media, your audience will wonder what happened to you, and they may even draw conclusions that you are no longer in business. So, keep showing up. And keep creating content with the intention to make a difference. Your audience will notice. #6: Be aware of your branding and style elements. The goal of social media is to drive brand awareness through connection. What you are striving for is to create content that people recognize and associate with your brand, even before they see who posted it or your logo in the corner of the profile image. Design isn’t everything, but it is certainly a component of a comprehensive marketing strategy, and it will help distinguish your brand from the rest. Play around and have fun with your brand design, and remember that it is a reflection of your business. #7: Encourage and nurture engagement. Remember, social media is the cocktail party, not the university lecture. Social media marketing allows us to reach our customers in some amazingly powerful ways that we do not want to take for granted. Ask your followers questions on stories, feed posts or videos, and be sure to respond to what they post in their replies. Some of the greatest needs of humans are to be seen, heard and appreciated. Listen to your followers, learn what matters to them and take the time to nurture your online relationships. #8: Use the tools inherent in each social media platform. No matter which social media channel you’re looking at, these apps were designed for people to use! This means that there are fun tools within each platform that were created to help you engage with others. Some examples include poll questions on Instagram stories, video editing features on TikTok and more. Experimenting with different functionalities can help increase your reach. It can also help with market research by showing you what types of content are most relevant and engaging to your audience. Channel your inner construction worker and use that toolbox! #9: Use the platform as a user. Creating a social media marketing strategy is very important, but don’t forget to have some fun! Rhea suggests: Engaging with other people’s accounts Following the hashtags that interest you Reaching out to new people Building relationships and connections Getting inspired by what others are doing Think of social media as attending a conference day in and day out: It is a major networking opportunity that is waiting for you to engage. In fact, we’ve heard that social media is on par with the networking opportunities you will find at the in-person Alltech ONE Conference — and that’s saying something! #10: Don’t become overly focused on the number of followers you have. It is important to not become too obsessed with the number of followers you accrue. Of course, growing your following is important, but quality definitely rules over quantity when it comes to social media. Make your social media goals all about growing a genuine following and connecting with them authentically. That will trump any number of bought or misaligned followers any time of day. Thinking back to the networking example we mentioned previously, if you go to a conference with no interest in any of the topics being spoken about, why are you there? The people there are likely not “your people,” and you will find the experience very unfulfilling. The same rule applies to social media: Go where you can find a community, and cultivate that connection and warmth on your own channels. Wrapping it all up Rhea ended her thorough presentation with this bit of wisdom: “Social media isn’t just about the sale. It is about community expansion, growing a brand, creating loyalty and celebrating and connecting with your people.” Whatever your social media goals are for your equine business, put these principles into action and have some fun! We guarantee you will see results.

I am sure you, too, if you care for horses, have asked the same question at some point. Horses produce 50 pounds of manure per day, over eight tons per year! Add to that the eight to ten gallons of urine a horse generates and the wheelbarrow or more of bedding used each day, and in no time at all, you will have a manure mountain. All that takes up a whole lot of valuable space that you would probably enjoy using for more interesting things than stockpiling manure. For me, that first small acreage experience was over 30 years ago, but the process of working out a useful horse manure management option led me on the exciting journey I am on today as an environmental educator working with horse owners around the country. In this article, I will share some of the problems associated with not having a solid system to deal with manure as part of your overall horse management program and cover the benefits of composting. We will go through the steps to manage compost and wind up with guidelines for using finished compost. The trouble with horse manure There are many concerns about the mismanaged manure pile (besides the obvious of wasted space and being an eyesore), such as: Horses grazing near their manure are quickly reinfested by larvae that hatch from worm eggs shed in manure. Odor and fly problems becoming a concern to you or your neighbors. Runoff from soggy manure piles causing water quality issues for creeks and wetlands, as well as for drinking water, which is a serious concern if you have your own well. Many areas have ordinances in place that strictly control these issues. What is composting? All organic matter, including manure and bedding, eventually decomposes. By providing an ideal environment, we put the beneficial bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms that speed up the decomposition process to work. As manure and stall waste are broken down, the microorganisms generate tremendous amounts of heat. This heat destroys weed seeds, fly larvae, worm eggs and other disease-causing pathogens. Finished compost is crumbly, earthy-smelling, dark material and a marvelous soil amendment that holds in moisture and adds nutrients. The compost bin vs. the compost pile In order to compost and generate heat, it is important to stack your manure and stall waste a minimum of three to four feet high. (Aim to make it at least the size of a washing machine.) You can build a bin out of cement or pressure-treated wood, or you can just create a large manure pile. Larger horse facilities or those with tractors might need a sturdy bin design with strong walls. If you live in a wet climate, you will need either a roof or a tarp over your bin to avoid piles getting too wet and soggy. A cement pad for the bottom is helpful when using a tractor to keep the area from turning muddy in the winter or rainy season. How to manage composting systems This includes tarping (covering), turning or aerating, and watering. Like most living things, the microorganisms that break down manure and bedding are aerobic, requiring air and water. Too much or too little of either can cause problems. Some simple steps to follow to manage the process are: 1. Choose the right location. Begin by locating an appropriate place for your composting site. For chore efficiency, choose an area convenient for chores with easy access to your horses, barn and paddocks. This area should be high, well-drained and away from waterways. Locating your pile at the bottom of a hill or in a wet area may mean it turns into a pile of mush. A dry, level area is especially important when it comes to accessing the pile with any kind of heavy equipment, such as a tractor or truck (which you may want for spreading the finished compost). 2. Piling. Place daily manure and stall waste in one bin or pile. When that bin or pile is as large as you want it (at least three feet), leave it and begin building a second pile or bin, and so on for the last bin. In two to four months, the first bin or pile should be finished, and you can start using the compost from that bin. It is a good idea to have two or three separate piles — or more if you would like. 3. Keep it covered! Covering your compost prevents the valuable nutrients you are saving in the compost from getting washed out and causing problems with the neighbors or in nearby waterways. A cover keeps your piles from becoming a soggy mess in the winter or too dried out in the summer. This can be accomplished with a tarp, plastic sheet or by building a roof. Since you will need to pull the tarp back every time you clean your horse’s stall and paddock, make the tarp as chore-efficient and easy to use as possible. You may want to attach your tarp to the back of your compost bin. TIP: If you live in a windy area, weigh down your tarp with milk jugs full of gravel. 4. Get air into the pile. Turning the compost-to-be allows oxygen to get to the bacteria and organisms that break down the material into dirt-like organic matter. This keeps the process aerobic and earthy smelling. If the compost becomes anaerobic, without air, it will have a foul, undesirable odor. How often you turn it determines how quickly your compost will be ready. On its own, air will permeate into the pile to a depth of one to two feet, so it’s the center of the pile that really needs air. Unless you have access to a tractor or enjoy a good workout, turning the pile by hand is difficult. An easy way to get air to the center and avoid frequent hand-turning is to insert a couple of five- or six-foot PVC pipes into the center of the pile like chimneys. Buy PVC pipes with holes in them or use a drill to put in holes along pipes. Alternately, you could use a tamping rod to insert a few holes into the center. The pile will still need to be turned from time to time to get the manure on the outside into the center so heat from the composting process can kill pathogens and evenly break down the material. 5. Keep it damp. Your compost material should be about as damp as a wrung-out sponge. Particularly in the summer, you will need to find a way to water your compost. Either use a garden hose when you turn it or just hose down the manure in your wheelbarrow before you dump it into the pile. The compost should be damp but not dripping with water. If you squeeze a handful of it in your hand (wear a glove if you want), you should only be able to squeeze out a drop or two. 6. Optional: Monitor the heat. A wonderful component of composting is the heat generated by the beneficial microbes. A compost pile can get fairly warm, about 130–150°F. If you want the compost to kill fly larvae, worm eggs, weed seeds and pathogens, you need it to reach these temperatures for about three or four days. You can monitor the temperatures easily with the aid of a long-stemmed compost thermometer purchased at a local garden store. 7. Finished compost. How actively you monitor the air and water and how often you turn it determines how quickly it will compost. It should take around three to four months to finish, perhaps longer in the winter. The volume of material piled up will decrease in size by about 50%. You will know when your compost is ready when the material looks evenly textured, dark and crumbly like dirt and no longer like the original material. It should be 90°F or less. 8. Put that black gold to good work! Compost is a rich soil amendment that improves the health of both plants and soil and helps to retain moisture. You can use your compost in your garden, give it away to your neighbors, or spread it on your pastures. Spreading manure in pastures during the growing season — from late spring to early fall — is best. You can use a manure spreader or simply spread it with a shovel from the back of a pickup truck or by the bucketful with a tractor. Do not spread it too thick to avoid smothering grass; just a sprinkling of about 0.25–0.5 inches at a time and no more than three to four inches per season in the same area. In conclusion Finished compost is a precious soil amendment infused with micro and macronutrients that work to add nutrients in a time-release fashion. Compost adds “life” to soils in terms of beneficial bacteria and fungi. Academic research shows that compost makes plants healthier, more disease-resistant and that just one application of compost can have benefits lasting five or more years. Compost will also help hold in moisture — very important for helping your pasture survive a summer drought or climate change! And composting provides you with a free, easy source of compost that saves you money. Your horseless gardening neighbors may find it a valuable commodity as well!

The best way to measure the condition of your cow herd is by utilizing body condition scores (BCS). As the name suggests, a BCS is an estimate of a cow’s condition or the amount of fat they are carrying. The amount of fat — and its placement — determines BCS. Body condition scoring is an easy and effective tool for producers to use, but a familiarity with the fat deposition and skeletal structure of cattle is required to properly determine BCS. The key areas used to evaluate the degree of body fat on cattle are the ribs, brisket, hooks, pins and tailhead. Typically, for beef cattle, a scale of 1 to 9 is used to indicate BCS, with 1 being emaciated, with all of the cow’s ribs and bones easily visible, and 9 being obese. Thin cows have a BCS of 1 to 3 Moderate-condition cows have a BCS of 4 to 6 Fat cows have a BCS of 7 to 9 The ideal BCS for mature range beef cows at calving is a score of 5, and for calving heifers, an ideal BCS would be a 6. This difference in BCS at calving is because heifers are still growing and have a higher nutrient requirement for growth compared to mature cows. Evaluate BCS prior to calving and breeding. Timing is important when evaluating body condition scores. Producers should aim to evaluate BCS prior to the calving and breeding seasons. Suggested evaluation timepoints include 90 days prior to calving, breeding and the start of the winter season. This will give the producer enough time to try to improve BCS if cows aren’t hitting their target prior to breeding and late gestation. Body condition scores can be used as a nutritional management tool. For instance, depending on a producer’s facilities, cows can be sorted into groups using BCS. Cows that meet or have above-target BCS scores need no special nutritional intervention and can maintain condition on quality range pasture. Cows with low body condition scores or replacement heifers could be supplemented with additional nutrients to improve or maintain their body condition during calving and breeding. Another good time to evaluate BCS is heading into winter grazing. Cows that are thin at the start of winter grazing will require supplemental feed just to maintain their body condition, as energy requirements increase up to 40% during the winter. Additionally, trying to improve BCS during the winter is going to cost 20–30% more than during the fall. A poor BCS can negatively affect a cow’s calf. The productivity of a cow herd depends on keeping them within the producer’s ideal BCS. It is well-established that a poor BCS can have detrimental effects on a cow’s reproduction. Thin cows take longer to come into heat and, therefore, only have one chance at rebreeding. Over-conditioned or fat cows can also negatively impact reproduction rates. However, a poor BCS can also affect the overall health and performance of a dam’s calf. The relationship between cow BCS and calf performance is based on the energy requirements of the cow. To maintain an ideal BCS, cows must have enough energy to support all of their bodily energy requirements. When a cow’s energy requirements are not met by her diet, then she must use the energy stored in her body as fat. The more stored energy she uses, the further she moves down the BCS scale. There is a priority use for energy for bodily functions, as outlined below: Priority energy use by cows (adapted from Short et al., 1990) Basal metabolism Grazing and other physical activities Growth Supporting basic energy reserves Maintaining an existing pregnancy Milk production Adding to energy reserves Estrous cycling and initiating pregnancy Storing excess energy (i.e., fat deposition) This hierarchy shows that maintaining pregnancy (i.e., gestation), milk production and reproduction are all lower on the list of energy-use priorities. This illustrates the importance of cows consuming enough energy from their diet to meet their maintenance requirements before energy can be used for pregnancy and milk production. A cow’s BCS affects her reproductive ability, too. Evaluating BCS at 90 days prior to calving — when cows are about to enter late gestation — is critical, as this is a moment in time that could impact the future growth and performance of her calf. Seventy- five percent of calf growth occurs during the last 60 days of gestation, meaning that the cow’s energy requirements are going to be higher for the last 60 days of her pregnancy. If cows are thin going into the third trimester of pregnancy, then there could be reduced calf growth due to a lack of energy available for supporting the pregnancy. Smaller calves are more prone to sickness after birth. Weaning weights have also been shown to be lighter when cows have a poor body condition. Until weaning, milk is the major energy and nutrient source for calves. If cows are in poor body condition, they lack the energy necessary to produce the quality milk needed for calf growth. Research has shown that herds that maintain cows with the ideal BCS ranges (5–7) have better calving and weaning percentages, which are a measure of the herd’s overall reproductive and production efficiency. Thin cows are going to have a harder time maintaining pregnancies and growing calves. A poor BCS leads to fewer pregnancies, fewer calves weaned and calves weaned at a lower weight, which leads to lower overall returns. Body condition scoring helps evaluate the nutritional status of the cow herd. Producers should routinely check the body condition scores of their herds to continually monitor the condition and nutritional status of the cows. If a large portion of the cow herd has a low body condition score, the herd nutrition should be evaluated to make sure that their energy and protein requirements are being met. A prolonged poor BCS can have a harmful impact on production outcomes, which can also negatively impact the economic returns of an operation. Evaluating BCS to determine not only the herd’s reproduction readiness scores but also its nutritional status is an opportunity to positively impact calf performance. Short, R. E., R. A. Bellows, R.

Despite what many of us may think, and unlike their human counterparts, horses fare better in decreasing temperatures. In fact, our equine friends are most comfortable at temperatures between 18–59° Fahrenheit, depending on their winter coat, body condition and wind and/or moisture presence. However, depending on the horse, the cold winter months may prescribe a need for dietary changes or supplementation not otherwise required in warmer weather. Hard keepers, senior horses and those with poor dentition, especially, can struggle to maintain a healthy body weight, while others may suffer from decreased thirst. All of these can equate to big problems for horse owners. Luckily, some seemingly minor nutritional changes can be beneficial for feeding horses in the winter, helping maintain weight, increase hydration and improve overall health. Success starts with adequate roughage for horses A mature horse at maintenance will consume 2–2.5% of their body weight in feed (both hay and grain) each day. At a minimum, horses must consume 1% of their body weight per day in good-quality forage to maintain a healthy gastrointestinal tract. Some quick math will put this in a real-life perspective. The average 1,000-pound adult horse, on a day of normal weather conditions, will eat: Between 20–25 pounds of total feed A minimum of 10 pounds of hay/pasture (1.5–2% is preferred) If you are feeding a diet that is solely forage, then you will need to estimate how much pasture your horse receives and how much additional hay you need to supply. Keep in mind that these ratios are likely to change in the winter when the ground is covered with snow, mud or other moisture, which is one reason why you may end up feeding more hay in the winter. Additionally, increased energy will be spent to stay warm during the winter. Horses are better able to control body heat if suitable roughage is provided. The horse’s hindgut is a big fermentation center due to millions of bacteria, fungi and yeasts that reside there. As these good gut microbes ferment hay, they create heat as a side effect. This is just one reason why it is critical to promote gut health in horses. Keep in mind that a horse’s need for heat (and therefore extra calories) will vary with the individual, depending on their: Age Breed Size Body condition Hair coat (has the horse been clipped?) Access to shelter Overall health status Geography and acclimation to cold weather Observing your horse individually as the temperature drops is the best way to determine their needs. It is a good idea to consistently body condition score your horse throughout the winter and put your hands on the six key areas as winter coats can easily hide weight changes. Also, remember: The horse has evolved over many centuries with much better systems (including a long winter coat) to keep warm than humans. Do not judge your horse’s circumstances or needs based on how you personally feel about the winter cold. The lower critical temperature in horses The lower critical temperature (LCT) is the temperature below which a horse requires additional energy to keep warm. In general, the estimated LCT is 41° Fahrenheit for horses with a summer coat and 18° Fahrenheit for horses with a winter coat. The rule of thumb is that for each degree drop below the LCT, your horse requires a 1% increase in energy. For example, if the temperature dropped to 0° Fahrenheit, a horse with a winter coat would require an 18% increase in feed. While some of this increase could come from grain concentrates, forage is the preferred source of increased energy due to its core-warming side effects that will help raise body temperature. Improving water intake The air temperature is not the only thing you need to consider. Drinking water should ideally fall between 45–65° Fahrenheit. If the water is too cold, intake will decrease, thereby reducing water and lubrication in the gut and, in turn, increasing the risk of cold-weather colic. As a reference, mature horses weighing 1,000 pounds require a minimum of 10–12 gallons of water daily to serve just their basic physiological needs. To help encourage drinking in cold temperatures: Consider purchasing a water trough heater or de-icer to keep drinking water at preferred temperatures Add salt or an electrolyte mix to your horse’s diet. Electrolytes are not just for hot weather but are involved in thousands of body functions to keep your horse healthy throughout the year Summary In the wild, horses can move continuously, forage for food and water sources, and utilize thick, wooly coats and the warmth of the herd to survive in the winter months. Domesticated horses do not always have the same options. They are limited to the space, pasture mates and food we provide, and their hair coats often do not stand up to the elements, possibly requiring blanketing and/or appropriate shelter. It is our responsibility to ensure that their cold-weather needs are being adequately met to keep horses healthy and happy through every season. I would like to learn more about horse health.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/how-much-hay-feed-horse-winter","title":"\n\n                    How much hay to feed a horse in winter \n                    ","date":"January 4, 2022","contentLength":893}},{"pageContent":"The confinement area, often called a paddock, run, turnout, corral or dry lot, is the cornerstone of horse keeping. It is where we keep our horses to avoid overgrazing of pastures. In the winter, when pastures are dormant and soils are soggy or frozen, our horses live in their confinement areas. They are also where we keep our horses to prevent them from getting overweight on pasture or if they are recovering from an injury. However, horses in confinement must still have their primary needs met, which includes the ability to move about freely, have social contact and access to food at multiple times throughout the day. However, even with these needs being met, many confined horses develop physical or behavioral issues, such as pacing, chewing, aggression, nervousness or ulcers. That is where horse enrichment comes in. What is equine enrichment? Equine enrichment means providing stimulation in a horse’s environment to benefit their psychological and physical well-being. Here are a few ideas of ways to incorporate enrichment opportunities into a horse’s confinement area: 1. Confinement area shape or design: You may be able to design (or re-shape) your confinement area to stimulate your horse. A long, narrow paddock with feeding or water stations at either end encourages interest and movement. Create a track paddock — or provide access to one during turnout. This is simply a large, long confinement area shaped like a track, that encircles a pasture or other area. The goal of a track paddock is to encourage horses to move more freely and interact with others. Alternatively, your confinement area could double as a round pen for extra exercise. 2. Location: Locate your confinement area so your horse can interact with stimuli from the world around them. Set it up so your horse is a part of your everyday life — seeing things like kids playing, people coming and going, summertime lawnmowers and bicycles, snow shoveling in the winter, etc. This all provide mental stimulation. 3. Companionship: Be sure your horse has equine neighbors next door so they can at least see and possibly interact through nose touching or mutual grooming. 4. Rolling area: Rolling is a natural activity that improves coat and skin condition, as well as comfort. It is also thought to increase a horse’s flexibility by stretching and engaging muscles in the back, neck and barrel. If you have room, perhaps you can create a sand pile in your horse’s paddock for this purpose. Alternatively, use a sand arena or round pen for regular turnout so they can roll there. 5. Food: More frequent, smaller meals are healthier for horses and mimic their natural lifestyle. Also, try feeding in different locations or stations, so they do a bit of food seeking. You might offer different food types in different areas, such as hay cubes or low-quality hay for extra “chew time.” You should also consider a hay net or a slow feeder, which stretches eating time further and can help enrich equine feed experiences. 6. Browsing: You may be able to occasionally incorporate small branches of an edible plant, such as willow, cottonwood, bamboo or blackberry vines. Weave a branch or vine into paddock fencing or incorporate a holder into their paddock for this purpose. (NOTE: Be sure to carefully research what is safe and non-toxic for your area. Several plants are poisonous to horses, such as black walnut, yew, red maple, black locust, rhododendron, laurel, oak and most fruit trees. The ASPCA has a list of plants that are toxic and non-toxic to horses. You may also consult your veterinarian if you are feeling unsure.) 7. Healthy treats: More food-related ideas include feeding occasional treats, like watermelon, plums (without the pit), bananas (skin and all), grapes, celery or cut-up pieces of raw (orange) pumpkin. These, along with other low-sugar treats, can be fed in alternative locations to engage curiosity and food hunting behavior. 8. Horse enrichment toys: Most horse owners have heard of a Jolly Ball®! Toys like these may help, especially for young horses. Studies show that adult horses are less motivated by toys unless they are associated with food, such as hay balls or different kinds of treat licks. 9. Scratching pads or brushes: This could be a large nylon brush or a worn-out broom head that is safely bolted to a wall or corner. Alternatively, you may utilize a textured rubber doormat, which can be screwed to a wall. 10. Friends: You may want to consider getting a buddy for your horse. If not another horse, you might consider another animal companion for them, such as a burro or goat. A cat or dog will often befriend a horse, improving the emotional well-being of each of them. 11. Turnout: Turning your horse out, either by themselves or with other horses, gives them a chance to play, groom and interact. 12. Exercise and grooming: Even when you cannot ride, you can still groom and practice good hoof care. As an alternative to riding, you can hand walk, lunge or do liberty work with your horse. Plan to exercise your horse a minimum of 30 minutes, three times per week. Utilizing a confinement area is an important part of horse keeping. It not only provides an opportunity for movement — it also offers a way to decrease pasture impact while monitoring horse health. However, confinement areas can be stifling for some horses because of the lack of physical and emotional stimuli. Providing enrichment for horses does not have to be expensive and can be as simple as adding turnout time with others, providing quality hay or pasture in a more natural way, feeding a new type of feed or an occasional treat, or giving your horse a food ball or lick. It might even be as simple as scheduling a little extra one-on-one time with your horse. Think outside the box, mix things up and have fun together — and keep in mind that you are supporting both you and your horse’s emotional well-being at the same time.

But what role does nutrition play, both in the sustainability of our food chain and how we reduce the risk of viral diseases in our pig populations around the world? In a panel discussion at Alltech’s ONE Idea Conference, Dr. Barry Kerkaert, president of Pipestone Management, Dr. Scott Dee, director of applied research at Pipestone Veterinary Services and Dr. Jon De Jong, president of Pipestone Nutrition, discussed how a porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) outbreak in their farms led to a surprising discovery about how it was transmitted and what they have done to help prevent future issues. Feed as a risk for viral transmission As people in livestock and agriculture know, a huge part of a farmer’s success depends on animal health. When a farm is challenged by diseases such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) or PED, it is all-hands-on-deck to determine what caused the outbreak and stop it from spreading further. When PED was first introduced into the United States in 2013, affected farms initially seemed to have no connections, whether animal, transport or people connection. Questions arose surrounding what was causing the virus to spread so rapidly. Then, in early 2014, four barns in the Pipestone system had an outbreak in under 24 hours, prompting an investigation that would eventually lead to a breakthrough discovery about the role of feed in viral transmission. The feed mill connection Part of Pipestone’s thorough investigation was looking into the feed mill. As they continued to dig deeper into how PED spread in these secluded farms, they found that the four farms all received feed out of the same batch from the same feed mill. However, other farms fed using the same mill with no disease issues were fed out of a different batch. Because of this discovery, Pipestone decided to pursue feed’s role in transmitting the virus aggressively. Dr. Scott Dee and Pipestone’s veterinary and nutrition teams quickly concluded that feed, based on their observations and collected data, was responsible for moving this virus throughout their farms. It was a monumental discovery — the first time in the history of veterinary medicine that the transmission of PED had been shown experimentally through feed. Now, seven years later, new studies show that other viruses, such as PRRS, African swine fever (ASF), foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), hog cholera or classical swine fever (CSF) and Senecavirus (SVA), live in feed and provide even more evidence that feed ingredients represent a risk for transporting pathogens at domestic and global levels (Dee et al., 2018). The cost of an outbreak: The financial and human toll When thinking about disease outbreaks on their sow farms, Pipestone considered the cost to both the farm and the downstream flow. It is estimated that for their farms, with around 5,400 sows, a PRRS break would cost $1.5 million. The cost to include their preferred mitigant as part of their biosecurity program was approximately $0.30–0.40 per weaned pig. “When I start thinking about mitigation, and we just do the math, $0.30 a weaned pig annualized off those sow farms, we need to prevent one PRRS break every 22 years from feed in order for that mitigation product really to be a breakeven, to pay for itself,” Dr. De Jong said, explaining how using their mitigant of choice was a no-brainer. “So, when we looked at it, it seemed like, geez, I sure think we can reduce at least one break in a 20-year timeframe with the use of a mitigant specifically targeting some of those higher-risk times of the year when we've got some cold weather up here in Minnesota and South Dakota.” However, the financial toll of a disease outbreak is just a piece of the puzzle. When looking at a mitigation plan, farmers make decisions based on the health and safety of their pigs. Still, it is also vital to recognize an essential of sustainability: the employee — their health and attitude, which makes them want to come to work every day. When the animals are unhealthy, the team’s morale deteriorates, and that can result in higher turnover, usually leading to poorer results. Biosecurity starts with feed safety Does feed pose a disease contamination threat on a farm? Absolutely. Is it the leading risk or the only risk? Absolutely not. However, it is part of a biosecurity program that needs consideration and thought. While other factors contribute to disease risk, a comprehensive biosecurity program is one of the most important programs a farm can put in place. It acts as the farm’s guard to keep it safe from outside threats and risks, and the first line of defense starts with feed safety.

We are constantly focused on what is happening right now, in our careers, families, social lives and more. Very rarely do we take the time, or even get the opportunity, to take a step back and look at the bigger picture. However, when we do get to take this broader view, it is only then that we begin to observe the issues that not only affect ourselves but the world and the people around us. And not only can we identify these challenges, but we can also engage with them and develop the opportunities and solutions that will help us all for generations to come. This was one of the main themes of “Economics and Health: A Natural Connection,” an in-depth keynote discussion between Alltech president and CEO Dr. Mark Lyons and Irish economist, author and university lecturer David McWilliams during the Alltech ONE Ideas Conference. Over the course of their conversation, the two speakers discussed a range of different countries that significantly influence global agriculture and assessed how their current and potential agricultural practices could affect the world as we know it. “How do we become what will be described as ‘good ancestors,’” asked McWilliams, “so people in the future can look back at us and say, ‘They left the place in good nick’?” This conversation came on the heels of a new animation project between Alltech and McWilliams. In a series of short videos, the two teamed up to focus on different nations’ economies in a quest to understand them better and learn how our histories and ideas are interrelated. “We thought it would be a good way to look at what's the big global challenge,” McWilliams explained. “What are the historic, what are the momentous events going on? And then (we can) say, ‘Okay, how do these percolate down into countries big and small, major producers but also small, nimble producers?” The outcome of this journey into world economics has been the revelation that everything is connected and that we all have a part to play in the betterment of our planet. “What the (COVID-19) pandemic has told us is that none of us are alone, none of us can isolate ourselves, and the world is kind of smaller than we thought — and more interrelated,” McWilliams continued. United States: Going back to its agricultural roots The first of these country-focused animations looked at the United States. In the video, McWilliams pointed out that: The U.S. agriculture output tripled between 1948 and 2015, with enormous gains in efficiency. Around 90% of farmers cannot make a living off of their land alone. Agriculture only contributes to 7.5% of total U.S. greenhouse gases, far below the 30% attributed to cars. Taking all of this information into account, McWilliams insisted that the U.S. itself will be the source of change in our environmental future. “I think American culture is changing, at least when you see it from the outside,” explained McWilliams when asked his thoughts on the current Biden administration and what it means for the future of the U.S. “He's saying, ‘There's no point being wealthy if the wealth is only (in the hands of) a small minority. The wealth has to trickle down to everybody else. And if it doesn't trickle down, we're going to force it up.’” What President Biden understands, according to McWilliams, is that the environment and inequality are the important issues and that they need to be addressed in order for the world to move forward, even if that goes against previously held beliefs. “We are now at this phenomenal, intergenerational tipping point that the older generation isn't quite getting and the younger generation hasn't quite articulated,” said McWilliams. “But what it is is a change of macroeconomic policy, and what is driving the entire thing is this idea that we cannot simply be a gratification mindset, all of us together. “We cannot have an immediate gratification mindset, which is ‘me, mine, my balance sheet, my profit margin, etc.,’” he continued. “We have to have a legacy mindset that we are, as I said at the top of the animation, we're just custodians. We're only passing through, right?” McWilliams also highlighted the Biden administration’s understanding that the farming community is key to addressing these issues, especially regarding the country’s environmental impact. He said that the president realizes that agriculture is the solution to meeting carbon-neutral targets in the future. With this in mind, McWilliams believes U.S. agriculture is about to go through an enormous change, reinstating confidence and self-belief in the industry that has been missing for a long time. “Before the industrial age, before the electricity age, before the internet age, there was agriculture,” McWilliams stated. “And agriculture will be the industry of the future, because only agriculture can naturally bring us to carbon neutrality. So, I think it's a really exciting time.” Brazil: Re-telling the story When it comes to feeding the world, Brazil is at the forefront. The South American country is: The largest exporter of beef and chicken meat globally. The world’s fourth-largest producer of swine. The largest exporter of soybeans and coffee. The biggest global producer of sugar and ethanol. The most widespread exporter and producer of orange juice, claiming over half of the global market. But, according to the animation created by Alltech and McWilliams, Brazil has often failed to spread the good news stories of its agri-food industry. While its soybean farmers may feed billions, we only ever hear nightmarish stories of them forcing cattle ranchers off their land and allowing the rainforest to be destroyed. The video suggests that maybe now is the time for Brazil to reassess its legacy and to show how, rather being than part of the problem, its agricultural industry is actually integral to the global solution. McWilliams is convinced that as long as Brazil can improve the messaging, it could be at the forefront of agricultural and environmental change. “It seemed to me that if Brazil gets its agriculture right, the world gets its agriculture right,” explained McWilliams. “And what happens in Brazil will happen elsewhere around the developing world.” However, he believes that the country first has to get its story right. He suggested that Brazil has to focus on aggressively positive messaging, revealing to people how much of what they eat comes from Brazil and how efficiently it is produced. “And that, I think, is its challenge over the next 10 or 15 years, because it's clear that Brazil is going to go from strength to strength in terms of basic production,” concluded McWilliams. “The question is: Can it go from strength to strength in terms of people's perceptions of whether Brazil is a good environmental citizen?” China: A changing economic and agricultural landscape According to the next installment in this animation series, the next 30 years will be the most important in the history of agriculture. This will be mainly due to the changing economic and agricultural landscape of China and Asia as a whole. The short video states that in order for China to succeed in becoming the world’s largest economy and military power, it must secure a sufficient food supply for its people and ensure that they are not subjected to inflated food prices. However, this is complicated by the fact that China has limited natural resources, particularly water. The outcome has been a transformation and modernization of Chinese agriculture, an industry that utilizes cutting-edge agriculture technology like no other country. This development has allowed China to stake its claim as the world’s most sustainable food producer. Another huge trend in China and Asia as a whole, McWilliams pointed out, is that with newfound wealth comes a change in diet. This can be seen with upper-middle-class Asians, who are dining on a more Western diet of beef and dairy instead of traditional tofu and rice. This shift in taste is another indicator of how the continent will influence food and agriculture production and the supply chain as we move forward. “The future is one whereby China will try and do whatever it can to make sure that its agricultural production remains high and/or that it can buy in food,” McWilliams explained. Ireland: The benefits of modernizing agriculture When considering a list of some of the biggest agri-food producers and consumers on the planet, you could be forgiven for thinking that the addition of this small island on the edge of the Atlantic was a clerical error. But Ireland is a significant player when it comes to the global agriculture industry. According to the animation focusing on the island, Ireland’s geographic location and climate make it the perfect place for healthy grass growth. And with healthy grass growth comes healthy cows. This amounts to a total of $13 billion in annual food exports. However, there are large stumbling blocks scattered along Ireland’s path to energy-efficient and sustainable food production. One is the commonly encountered misconception that the solution to reducing carbon emissions is to reduce food production — something that McWilliams said the European Union is pushing but that he believes is a mistake. “In order for the European Union to get an aggregate reduction in carbon emissions,” McWilliams evaluated, “it would seem to me much more logical to favor those countries that have had an evolutionary or ecological or environmental gift, in order to actually produce more, not less, in places like this, because your input/output ratio is so much lower here (in Ireland) than it is either in the parched Mediterranean or in the frozen tundra of the North.” McWilliams believes that in order for Irish agriculture to modernize and grow, it needs to take a leaf out of the book of one of Ireland’s leading sectors: technology, which generates over $25 billion in exports. He said in the animation that embracing innovation could cultivate new agricultural breakthroughs, making Ireland the most resource-efficient, carbon-neutral, sustainable food producer on Earth — something which, in turn, could produce a new export: incredibly valuable ag-tech. In concluding the discussion, McWilliams reiterated that everything in economics is interrelated and that positive change now will lead to further growth in the future, allowing us to leave a positive legacy for generations to come.

[And as Alltech ruminant research director Dr. Vaughn Holder reminded us], we have not just one now, but [rather] two very important jobs: nourishing people and preserving our planet. “We have the science that is showing us the way, but we also know [what to do] intrinsically,” Lyons continued. “It’s something that’s within us. Let’s not let negativity [and perceived barriers] suppress our inner truths.” A good thing Lyons went on to point out that we should take heart in Mick Ebeling’s message of doing at least a little bit of good for others each day. “[Doing good is good.] It’s good for our business. It’s good for our brand. It’s good for recruiting, and it’s good for retention,” he said. “[Think about it]. What is the number-one challenge in your business? People. It was before the pandemic, and it is even more so today.” Lyons has a point. According to a recent survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, the so-called “great resignation” isn’t over: “Higher pay, more job fulfillment and wanting to be ‘truly themselves’ at work are the [key] factors pushing workers to change jobs.” It would appear that the answer to this modern-day dilemma might be simpler than we may have originally thought. A transformative opportunity Lyons went on to note, “This is an opportunity for transformation. What a gift [we’ve been given: the ability] to work together to create a planet the way we want to see it. “We can have profitable businesses while solving the world’s biggest problems,” he continued. “There is so much more agriculture can do.” He’s not wrong. As studies have shown, we capture more carbon in the soil with animals on the land than we would without them. That’s information that the average person is likely unaware of, and “that’s the power that you [in agriculture] have. Tell the story,” Lyons urged the audience. “As my father [the late Dr. Pearse Lyons] liked to say, ‘Don’t get it right. Get it going’ — much to the remiss of many perfectionists, including [my mother],” Lyons continued. “But he was right! It’s not about perfectionism, it’s about progress. If we change the lens and the way we look at things, we can change the way we think.” The power of anti-goals Before you enlist Google’s help in discovering what anti-goals are, I’ll save you the trouble: Anti-goals are a concept developed by Tiny Capital co-founder Andrew Wilkinson. They’re about things you don't want to happen or the person you don’t want to be a year from now. So, essentially, instead of envisioning positive outcomes surrounding potentially hard-to-attain goals, you think about all the things you don’t want to happen and what actions you can take to avoid these potential challenges. So, consider: What things do you not want to happen? What outcome would make achieving your goal hardly worth it? How do you avoid that? This is an example of inverted thinking. It’s much easier to solve a problem backwards than it is forward, and anti-goals are designed to help you assess potential barriers before you encounter them. Camp or climb? In closing, Lyons remarked, “Every great ascent begins with a vision. Are we okay here? Are we going to be complacent? Shall we camp? Or will we climb?” He encouraged the audience to give those around them the courage to achieve great things and to work toward a Planet of Plenty™. “[Before we part, I’d like to ask] you to do a [few] things,” Lyons said. “[The first is to] think of that one person you can help, as Mick [Ebeling] challenged us to do. [The second is to] think of one collaboration [you can set into motion] — someone you can work with who can help you achieve your ambitions. And [finally, I would encourage you to] think of someone you could bring [to the Alltech ONE Conference] next year.” You never know. These few simple tasks could transform your life, that of another — or both. See you on the ascent.

Africa has seen incomes grow by three percent in just 10 years and The Economist magazine coined the phrase, ‘Africa rising,’ to reflect that eight out of the world's 10 fastest-growing economies are in Africa. In fact, both the World Bank and United Nations have recently issued reports pointing out that scaling up agriculture and agribusiness is the next frontier in Africa’s revitalization, and the fastest way to address rural poverty and hunger. The 2014 Global Feed Tonnage Survey we released in January, which assesses the compound feed production of 130 countries each year, reported that Africa is the fastest-growing feed producing continent for the second time in a row, reaching 31 million tons of feed produced in 2013. Additionally, according to the findings, Africa’s chicken and broiler market is only a mere five years away from being the size and scope of that in Thailand or Brazil – two of the world’s top countries for poultry production. Moreover, Africa has an abundance of three things that are critical to successful agriculture: sunshine, rain and land, at a time when these are in short supply elsewhere. Agribusinesses can invest in Africa to bring new technologies and techniques to the region while also profiting from the region’s rich aquaculture and land mass potential. It’s important to acknowledge the obstacles that Africa faces when it comes to logistics, storage and infrastructure (the “GLIMPSE” factors) but it’s more important to see the opportunity that exists if we can overcome these challenges. In terms of landmass, Africa is capable of housing China, the United States, Russia, and Western Europe within its borders. As home to one of the world’s fastest-growing economies in terms of GDP, it should become a $1 trillion food market by 2030. Such a dramatic change would not only transform Africa from being largely dependent on food imports, to becoming a potential food exporter. More importantly, it will increase the availability of affordable food and significantly decrease widespread hunger. I invite you to come and be a part of Alltech’s 30th Annual International Symposium as we embrace the future of agriculture together, and take a hard look inside the business opportunities that lie within Africa and the markets it impacts. My colleagues and I will outline the agricultural revolution occurring in Africa and the big issues it faces, where to invest and what to invest in, and present case studies on those businesses who have succeeded so far in the underutilized terrain. Furthermore, we will open by honoring the father of the Green Revolution, and one of agriculture’s greatest advocates, Dr. Norman Borlaug, with Alltech’s 2014 Medal of Excellence. We will present the posthumous award to Borlaugh’s granddaughter, Julie Borlaugh Larson, in honor of his agricultural innovations that saved more than a billion people worldwide from starvation. She will open our Africa session, which promises to be a tremendous event -- meant to inspire, inform and spur ambition and motivation into the future of agriculture.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/what-does-africa-mean-you","title":"\n\n                    What does Africa mean to you? \n                    ","date":"August 19, 2014","contentLength":534}},{"pageContent":"The pathology of cattle consuming endophyte-infected tall fescue varies greatly based on the weather and the alkaloid concentration. The most readily apparent signs of fescue toxicosis include reduced feed intake, weight gain, milk production and reproductive efficiency, as well as tissue necrosis and a rough hair coat. Decreases in productivity caused by fescue toxicosis are estimated to cost U.S. beef producers more than $2 billion annually (Kallenbach, 2015). Absorption of alkaloids Calculating the animal’s retention of ergot alkaloids is difficult due to biotransformation. Generally, it is estimated that 76–92% of consumed ergot alkaloids are absorbed, with the other 8–24% excreted in the feces. The math on alkaloid absorption and excretion doesn’t always add up, as alkaloids are broken down and/or biotransformed into numerous metabolites. Most alkaloids are ultimately excreted in the urine as lysergic acid. Fescue alkaloids and microbiome shifts An emerging area of research is the interaction between fescue alkaloids and the microbiome. Decreases in the Erysipelotrichaceae family and increases of Ruminococcaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Clostridiaceae, as well as abundances of Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria phyla have been reported for cattle grazing infected fescue. Fescue seed extract, when added to in vitro fermentations, led to increased populations of tryptophan-utilizing bacteria. Considering the tryptophan base of ergot alkaloids, this increase likely indicates an up-regulation in detoxification capacity. The characterization and identification of the three isolates with the highest conversion abilities found that all three were gram-positive, spore-forming rods that produced ammonia from tryptophan, classified as Clostridium sporogenes. Receptor-binding of fescue ergot alkaloids Due to the structural similarity of ergot alkaloids and serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and epinephrine, several receptor types in numerous tissues are affected during fescue toxicosis in cattle. This results in a wide range of effects on physiology and metabolism. As more research examining the underlying mechanisms is completed, the connections between ergot alkaloid receptor-binding and animal performance grow more complex. Individual animal sensitivity to infected fescue is affected by: Environmental conditions. The density of the receptors. The capacity for liver and ruminal degradation. Other genetic factors. Fescue's effect on weight gains Ergot alkaloid-induced vasoconstriction reduces heat dissipation, resulting in a variety of physiological fescue toxicosis symptoms in cattle, including an increased respiration rate and elevated core body temperature. Ultimately, this leads to lower weight gains — which is generally known as the summer slump, as animals spend less time grazing as a result of standing in the shade or water to cool off. In colder months, fescue-associated vasoconstriction combines with thermoregulatory vasoconstriction, resulting in tissue death in the extremities, which is commonly known as fescue foot. Ergot alkaloid consumption also leads to: The thickening of the medial layer of blood vessels Endothelial cell damage Vascular stasis Thrombosis Ischemia Changes in blood pressure, among other cardiovascular effects Fescue's effect on rumen fill The frequency and amplitude of the ruminal contractions, as well as changes in eating patterns due to fescue toxicosis in cattle, combine to affect rumen fill, passage rates and intake. Vasoconstriction also reduces blood flow to the rumen, decreasing VFA absorption. Increased rumen fill provides a negative feedback loop, exacerbating reduced intakes. While the total tract digestibility of the feeds is generally unchanged, these alterations work in concert to reduce nutrient availability, contributing to the reduced growth rate frequently observed in cattle grazing fescue. Added to this are the effects of alkaloids on circulating serotonin levels, the hypothalamic center and tryptophan-related satiety. Fescue's effect on energy metabolism Ergot alkaloids affect energy metabolism primarily when alkaloid intakes are high and during heat stress. Growth differences in cattle during fescue toxicosis are most likely the result of reduced intake, as no differences in retained energy or energy partitioning were caused by alkaloid ingestion when feed intake was equal. When fed near maintenance, cattle had lower basal metabolic rates. At higher feeding rates, maintenance energy requirements increased. When combined with observed increases in fat loss and a higher capacity for gluconeogenesis in the liver, this indicates the prioritization of energy (when available) toward elevated respiration, thermoregulation and alkaloid detoxification. Economic losses due to fescue toxicosis As much as 75% of the economic losses attributed to infected tall fescue pastures are related to decreased calving rates. For cows: Alkaloid consumption reduces the circulating levels of several hormones important for reproductive efficiency, including progesterone and estradiol. Changes in ovarian follicle development, oocyte quality and luteal function have been reported. When combined with vasoconstriction to the uterus and ovaries, it is no surprise that reductions in reproductive efficiency are seen in cows grazing infected fescue. There is speculation that vasoconstriction in the umbilical cord contributes to low birthweights and diminished fetal development. On the bull side of the equation, research indicates that ergot alkaloids may: Affect sperm count. Increase the occurrence of abnormal sperm. Alter motility, especially during the summer months. Fescue's effect on milk production and calving The structural similarity of ergot alkaloids to dopamine results in reduced prolactin secretion from the anterior pituitary gland. Further, changes in gene expression in the mammary glands of cattle consuming fescue indicate alterations in their lipid metabolism and small molecule transport. Altogether, these changes translate to reduced mammary development and lower milk production. Similar changes in lipid metabolism can be seen in reduced levels of circulating cholesterol and the occurrence of fat necrosis (lipomatosis), and in some cases of long-term alkaloid exposure, these fatty masses can cause digestive issues and dystocia. Fescue's effect on hair coat and immune function Reduced prolactin also leads to the rough hair coat that is often observed in cattle grazing infected fescue. Originally thought to be a retained winter hair coat, it is now known that low prolactin levels increase hair growth rates. As prolactin is a co-factor in humoral immune function, the long-term grazing of infected fescue can lead to depressed levels of immunoglobulins. However, as nutritional levels also affect immune function, more work needs to be done to determine whether altered immunocompetence is a direct result of ergot alkaloid consumption or a secondary effect of a diminished nutritional status. While there is no true fescue toxicosis treatment for cattle, there are ways to mitigate the challenges that fescue presents through management, nutrition and feed additives.

Equipping farmers to better respond to these demands is the driving principle of Alltech Crop Science through the development of biological solutions that contribute to crop productivity and protection while sustainably increasing farmers’ profitability. The threat of ongoing climate change, along with the ever-increasing extreme weather events seen around the world, creates uncertainty and instability in crop production. Decades of poor farming practices and high levels of pollution have led to soil depletion, resulting in the loss of approximately one-third of the world’s arable land. This scenario raises alarm bells for potential devastating consequences as the global demand for food soars, threatening food security and bringing sustainable agriculture to the forefront of everyone's minds. The great challenge facing us for the immediate future is to provide enough healthy, accessible and nutritious food for an ever-growing world population. Farmers and the food industry in general are being asked to increase food production by 70% by the year 2050. At the same time, the most recent environmental policies and regulations are oriented toward a reduction in and limitation of synthetic fertilizers, active substances and other solutions commonly used in crop production to stimulate yields and protect plants. The excessive use of chemical products increasingly affects soil health and nutrient availability and leads to soil degradation, the release of greenhouse gases generated by nitrous oxide, a risk of the chemical pollution of soils by nitrates and the contamination of aquifers. Several new regulatory, governmental, social and environmental requirements imply an evolution and innovation for the agricultural sector, and it is urgent that producers adopt new solutions that revitalize our soils, lead us to the responsible management of this crucial resource and assist in securing more sustainable crop production. Biotechnological solutions are gaining ground as an alternative to meet both current and future agricultural demands and are becoming a tool in sustainable agriculture. Bio-solutions drivers 1. Demographic growth. The need to feed more people with fewer and better-managed resources. 2. Climate change. Equipping crops to withstand increasing extreme weather conditions. 3. Crop nutrition. Sustainably improving crop nourishment and yields. 4. Sustainability. Partnering environment stewardship with profitability. 5. Soil preservation. Supporting the soil’s ecosystem balance and nutrient availability. Biologicals: What are we talking about? “Biological” is a buzzword encompassing a wide range of microscopic infinite potentialities fitting into three major groups: plant growth regulators, beneficial microorganisms, and biostimulants. From their roots to the tips of their leaves, plants are surrounded by virtually billions of these tiny species, whether they be bacteria, viruses, protozoa or fungi. Agricultural biologicals are one of the fastest-growing segments in agricultural inputs. The global biostimulants market alone was valued at $2.5 billion in 2019 and is expected to reach $5.35 billion in 2027, with the backdrop of an estimated $10 billion biologicals market by 2025. Biosolutions research, development and application span from seed treatment and soil and plant health to post-harvest and shelf life. Biofertilizer and biostimulant products are being used on a vast diversity of crops throughout the world, from fruits to vegetables and tree nuts, as well as row and field crops. Their use can strengthen plants, making them resistant to stress factors such as extreme temperatures (heat or cold) and water scarcity, and can boost their development and productivity. Biological products can incorporate conventional crop treatments — complementing and even enhancing the use of chemical crop protection products — in integrated pest management (IPM) programs or can be used in a full organic agriculture-oriented program. These biotechnology solutions help farmers reduce their fertilizer inputs and nutrient losses without reducing their soil fertility and protect the soil from physical and biological degradation. Biological products favour the fixation of atmospheric nitrogen or the solubilization of phosphorus and other nutrients in the soil, increasing their availability and uptake by plants. Microbial populations have always been a part of farming, but they’ve long been overlooked as a result of decades of poor agricultural practices. Restoring soil biology is a game-changer, bringing biologicals to the forefront of agriculture in the very near future. Alltech Crop Science (ACS) has a long-standing history of developing crop biologicals and bringing these sustainable alternatives to the market, helping farmers increase their productivity while addressing their concerns about profitability and sustainability. A new crop revolution is on the move “Produce more with less” is somewhat of a catchphrase, but it translates in full to the shift in farmers’ mindsets taking place in light of the different pressures to which agricultural production are being subject. The growing trend of sustainable agriculture, low residue levels, and support of worldwide legislation are the primary drivers leading the sector's growth. The use of biological solutions enables farmers to stay ahead of demands for the market’s environmental sustainability, responding to the pressing demands for quality, wholesome, zero-residue crops, aligning their search for sustainable yields with environmental concerns and global climate goals. The benefit comes from maximizing the use of natural resources such as water, light, the edaphic environment, and the genetic potential of crops, among other factors. Key benefits of biologicals use: Reduces the use of chemical inputs, lowering the environmental impact of crop production Optimizes crop productivity and quality, promoting food security Enhances plant resilience and response to biotic and abiotic stresses Promotes soil microbiological balance, favoring the soil Research and innovation bring farmers the solutions to respond to these great challenges, combining sustainability with profitability, respecting our common natural resources, caring for our animals and preserving the land, air and water to leave a planet full of potential for future generations.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/crop-biologicals-are-key-optimizing-crop-production","title":"\n\n                    Crop biologicals are key to optimizing crop production\n                    ","date":"May 9, 2022","contentLength":951}},{"pageContent":"Horse owners often wrongly believe that they are destined to put up with a high number of flies and insects. As mid-summer approaches and heat and dry weather become the norm, many parts of North America are likely to experience an onslaught of fly populations, while other parts of the country are likely to have intense mosquito issues. Additional troublesome insects, such as biting midges — often called “no-see-ums” or buffalo gnats — can make summer almost unbearable for horses. All of this makes many of us horse owners want to resort to utilizing heavy-hitting chemicals to keep our animals comfortable. While there may be a time and a place for this type of chemical warfare, looking at some big-picture management options is the safest way to begin your warfare strategy and reduce the need for insecticides. You should waste no time in planning your attack on the coming season’s flies and insects. In this blog, I will review some of the least-toxic, most environmentally friendly methods for reducing and managing the fly and insect population at your horse facility, including diminishing the insect habitat, using mechanical barriers, putting beneficial insects and native birds to work for you, and setting non-insecticidal traps. We will also cover the topic of insecticides so that, if using these products becomes necessary, you can make an informed decision. Using these controls as your first line of defense will help you reduce both the amount of chemicals used around your property and your impact on the environment. Less flies and fewer chemicals will be healthier for you and your horses, all while promoting sustainability in the equine industry. 1. Practice manure management. Insecticides and fly sprays are commonly used in livestock fly control protocols, but you can greatly reduce your dependence on them if your manure and mud are managed properly, as flies, mosquitoes and other pests depend on manure and mud as a breeding ground. Start with picking up the manure in stalls and confinement areas on a regular basis and developing a composting or manure storage area. Composting manure is the best option, as flies are generally associated with fresh manure rather than compost. A simple cover or tarp helps prevent rain runoff, which can contaminate surface water, creating the muddier habitat in which insect pests prefer to breed. Gutters and downspouts on farm buildings divert clean rainwater away from animal confinement areas, reducing the chance of mud and the amount of water and mud in which insects could live. Stagnant water — that is, water that has not been moved or added to for five to seven days — can become a breeding site for mosquitoes in levels as small as half of a teacup. Flies and other pests also need water to survive, so it’s important to eliminate unnecessary sources of water, such as leaky faucets. Get rid of anything lying around that can hold stagnant water, such as old tires, toys, flowerpots, birdbaths, dog water bowls, buckets, barrels or trash. Some insects — including face flies, biting midges, and deer or horse flies — do not like to enter darkened barns or stables. Providing your horse with a shelter or putting them inside a barn before and during dusk (when these insects are most active) may help horses escape being attacked by these miserable creatures. Biting midges and mosquitoes tend to be poor flyers, so offering good ventilation or safely placing a fan outside a stall can create air movement, which may help individual horses that are particularly tormented by bugs. 2. Prioritize pasture management for horses. Whenever possible, graze horses on higher, drier pastures at the beginning of the summer to avoid creating muddy areas. Save the lower, wet pastures — which harbor mosquitoes, deer flies, horse flies and biting midges — until later in the summer when those areas dry out. Harrow (or drag) your pastures regularly to break up manure piles. Harrowing spreads manure, allowing plants to utilize the nutrients and organic materials contained therein. Spreading also dries out manure, making it a less attractive habitat for flies. Using footing materials — such as finely crushed gravel (sized 5/8 of an inch or less) or coarse sand — in confinement areas helps to further reduce mud. Three to six inches of footing material will help build up the area, keeping horses up out of the dirt and allowing rainwater to drain through. 3. Use physical barriers. Most horse owners know about one wonderfully safe and effective method of fly management for horses: the fly mask. Fly masks act as a physical barrier between the horse and flies, with the added benefit of being a sunscreen for horses that are sensitive to sunburn. Most horses learn to appreciate fly masks quickly and will willingly lower their heads to have a mask put on them. Some masks only protect the eyes, while others also protect ears and jowls. Fly sheets are an additional option. These cool, open-weave, lightweight horse blankets can be quite useful at keeping pestering flies off a horse’s body. Fly boots are also available to help protect the horse's legs and hooves by helping to greatly decrease stomping. 4. Recognize good bugs. When it comes to pest management, we often err by approaching all insects as pests. However, according to the Xerces Society — a forty-year-old nonprofit organization that works to conserve habitats for beneficial insects worldwide — only about 2% of all insects are actually considered pests. The Xerces Society also reports that beneficial insects are worth quite a bit to agriculture economically: around $4–12 billion annually. Many insects prey on each other, and insects would rule the world if that were not the case. One example of a beneficial insect that horse owners can put to work is the fly parasite, a gnat-sized, nocturnal wasp that lays its eggs in the developing pupae of flies, thereby reducing or nearly eliminating the fly population. Fly parasites do not harm humans or animals in any way and are rarely even noticeable, since they are tiny and are only active at night. Commercially raised fly parasites can be purchased from several sources, which can be located by doing an internet search of the words “fly parasite”. To be most effective as a fly control program, fly parasites should be released early in the fly season and every four weeks thereafter. 5. Encourage insect-eating birds. Encouraging insect-eating birds to move into your yard and barn area is an excellent method for reducing the flying insect population. Members of the swallow family can be a tremendous asset to a horse facility, as they dive and dart through the neighborhood collecting bugs. One adult barn swallow will consume several thousand insects per day — a number comparable with using a bug zapper via a method that is much safer than using insecticides. Some common North American insect-eating birds include violet-green swallows, tree swallows, barn swallows, bluebirds, purple martins and cliff swallows. Nesting can be encouraged by hanging nest boxes specifically made for the types of birds in your area. Swallows, such as violet-greens, will utilize nesting material like hair that is shed by horses or dogs. For help determining the insect-eating birds specific to your part of the country and their nest box needs, consult your local Audubon Society, birding organization, extension office, wild bird store or library. 6. Accept bats. Bats play an important part in every healthy environment by eating the nocturnal flying insects that plague both our horses and ourselves, such as mosquitoes. Bats are reported to eat up to 600 mosquitoes an hour — more than 5,000 a night! They also eat other agricultural pests, such as corn borers, cutworm moths, potato beetles and grasshoppers. You may be able to encourage a bat family to move onto your property by hanging a bat box built specifically for the types of bats common in your region. Bat houses should be placed on the southern exposure of a barn, pole, tree or house. The best habitat is within a half-mile of a stream, lake or wetland. Place bat houses by early April and be patient, as it may take up to two years for a bat colony to find your house. A word of caution: Because of the concern for rabies, which can be carried by bats (as well as any warm-blooded animal), consult your veterinarian for their recommendations on vaccinating your horses against rabies. And just as you would do with a stinging insect or an unfamiliar dog, always leave bats alone. Bats are not aggressive, but like any wild animal, if cornered, they may bite to defend themselves. 7. Use insect and fly traps. Several types of simple, non-toxic insect traps can be extremely useful for reducing the flying insect population on your farm. The cheapest and easiest are sticky traps; flying insects happen across them and get stuck. Fly paper or sticky tape can be attached above doorways or from barn ceilings. Old-fashioned sticky strips — the coiled kind — are probably the cheapest and easiest to utilize. Try hanging many of them (i.e., 10 or more) from your barn ceiling. Once they are full of dead flies, remove the old pieces of tape and hang fresh ones. Choose these locations carefully to avoid snagging human hair or swishing horse tails. Other kinds of traps include brightly colored sticky tubes, as bright colors attract flies; these tubes can also be hung up. These traps may or may not come with an attractant (i.e., an embedded scent), which flies seek out. Several commercial brands of pesticide-free bags are available on the market. The stinky attractant used in these bags activates when dissolved in water. Lured by the scent (and perhaps also the color), flies enter the trap through the yellow cap top and drown in the water. These bags come ready to hang and use and are easy to dispose of when full by simply tossing into the trash. There are also reusable varieties. Place attractant bags on the perimeter of your property to lure flies away from high-traffic areas. The downside to these traps is that they are smelly — which is another good reason to place them away from barn areas. 8. Understand your chemical control options. An insecticide is a chemical that kills insects, while a repellant is a substance that discourages flies and other insects from landing. When using insecticides, read and follow the directions carefully and avoid using more than necessary. Only use insecticides that are recommended for use on horses. Generally, insecticides are meant to be used outdoors, in well-ventilated, open places — not in an enclosed area, such as an indoor stall or barn. Indiscriminate use of insecticides may promote resistant strains of flies and could kill beneficial insects or harm birds and bats. Equine insecticides generally fall into one of four categories (listed here in order from least to most toxic): Pyrethrins (a botanical insecticide made from chrysanthemums) Permethrins (synthetic pyrethrins) Carbamates Organophosphates Unfortunately, “least toxic” and “most effective” don’t always go hand in hand. Even the best fly sprays containing pyrethroids do not last long. Insecticides are usually used as premise sprays, which means that any insect they come into contact with will potentially be killed — including beneficial ones, not just pests. Most equine fly sprays are repellents. Repellents are available as sprays, lotions, wipe-ons, gels, dusting powders, ointments, roll-ons, shampoos and towelettes. Repellents contain a substance irritating to flies, such as oil of citronella, and most contain some amount of insecticide. Repellents also contain a product, known as a base, that helps hold the active ingredients to the horse’s body hair. The most common repellent bases are water, oil or alcohol. Oil-based repellents remain on the horse’s hair shaft longer, but oil attracts dirt. Water-based repellents do not last as long but attract less dirt, and alcohol-based repellents can be drying to the horse’s skin. To increase the lasting effect, some repellents are made with silicone, which coats the hair shaft and holds the repellent in place longer. Repellents can also contain sunscreen, coat conditioners (such as lanolin or aloe vera) and other products that may increase their staying power. How long a repellent lasts depends on the weather, the exercise level of the horse (i.e., how much they sweat), brushing and rolling. Moderation is key. Sometimes chemicals must be used, especially on insect-sensitive horses, but it is best to avoid spraying the horses every day or while they are in their stalls or pens; that’s a lot of chemicals to put on the horse, and it may also be very costly. Say goodbye to the bugs in the horse barn. The key point to keep in mind when trying to manage insects is to first strive to diminish the insect habitats where insects live and breed, which include mud, manure and stagnant water. After you have these areas under control, go after insects with birds, bats, fly parasites and non-insecticidal traps. Beyond that, if certain insects become problematic, you can choose whether you want to use a repellent or an insecticide-based spray on your horse. With these tools on hand, you’ll have more options available for the coming insect season, meaning you won’t have to put up with as many pests and can also reduce the use of chemicals on your horse property.

Over the years, improvements in management systems and aquaculture feed mean that we can now produce more food than ever before. However, with the demand for food fish rising alongside a growing global population, the future will see further changes in this industry. Here are some of the current main developments that will define the next steps in aquaculture’s legacy. Increased application of recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are not a new topic. This farming method has been around since the 1980s and used intensively in the Atlantic salmon industry for many years. However, it has taken the rest of the aquaculture industry almost 20 years to embrace it. There are several reasons why RAS is the future, but the primary reasons are: Sustainability Efficiency To operate a successful RAS, feed must be optimized to increase palatability, reduce water pollution and allow both the system and the fish perform at their best. As RAS facilities are land-based operations, there is reduced pressure on pond/sea stocks. Also, advancements have been made to recycle existing water in these facilities, preventing a further drain on resources. Further developments in this area have seen the development of RAS systems for shrimp, revolutionizing shrimp farming by allowing more controlled environments and easing long-term environmental challenges. Furthermore, we are seeing a shift in governmental legislation and movement from cage farming for environmental reasons, such as maintaining freshwater quality and protecting wild fish populations, including aquatic plants and animals. This implies a very strong future for RAS. Removing fishmeal and fish oil from aquaculture feed Feed, essentially, provides energy and nutrients to support the development of each species, but the fish has no preference regarding how the energy and nutrients are sourced. The percentage of fishmeal in aquatic diets has significantly reduced since 2000, and the move from fishmeal and fish oil for many fish species is not very far away. Plant proteins and other ingredients can replace the fishmeal component in fish food. However, they are majorly constrained by issues of low digestibility. Formulations must be highly digestible, and each ingredient must add value and enrichment to the diet to impact performance. Utilizing enzymes in aquafeed can help fish and shrimp digest feed better to support a healthy digestive system and help increase cost-efficiency. Choosing a feed that is right for your farm means you could potentially: Use less feed Improve production Improve output Reduce environmental impact Unfortunately, there is a hidden risk when increasing the quantity of plant-based raw materials on aquaculture farms. Mycotoxin contamination is known as a silent enemy for producers as it is visibly difficult to detect. Long-term ingestion of feed with low/acute or high exposure levels can be a reason for poor growth and unexplained mortalities on fish farms. Correct management at all relevant production points is crucial in handling this threat. Feed supplements can also help negate the effects of mycotoxins in the digestive tract and prevent them from being absorbed by the body. Additionally, logistics are increasing at an alarming rate. This provides an opportunity to improve sustainable practices and become less dependent on imports. The quality team at Alltech Coppens has focused on sourcing quality local ingredients and adapting the formulations to suit these conditions and provide the most benefit to the fish. Advancements in feed formulation, a significant move to net energy formulations Feed production must be efficient and cost-effective for the producer. To produce a feed that can provide the fish with optimal energy levels for production, understanding the digestibility parameters of each raw material is crucial. The gross energy is the total energy is available in the feed to the animal. When the animal digests feed, it uses digestible energy. Further energy will be lost due to metabolic processes, and what remains becomes net energy. The fish can use net energy to grow and maintain its health status. Micronutrients are key to maximizing this growth, but their efficiency can vary. Recent research in the Alltech Coppens Aqua Centre has shown that metabolic energy losses can range from 30–40% if the feed is not correctly formulated, impacting the growth of the fish. Comparing the net energy of different types of feed, as well as considering palatability and sustainability, can help producers choose the best feed for performance. A healthy gut is the key to success Achieving optimal health status in fish is one of the main goals for aquaculturists. Disease and/or significant growth reduction will increase costs for the producer. Poor health status can account for some of the biggest losses in the fish farming industry. At Alltech, we believe that a healthy gut is the key to success. A healthy gut can digest and absorb the maximum amount of nutrients. The intestinal microflora, gut morphology, immune system and nutrient uptake — plus how each of these elements interacts — all play a role in the health and performance of fish and shrimp. Animals in farmed environments also require essential nutrients to meet their basic nutritional needs. A fish’s skin, gut and gills are the primary points of interaction with external environmental factors that can impact its health. These organs must be protected, both internally and externally. The more robust the animal, the less vulnerable it will be to stress throughout the production cycle, ensuring the highest levels of efficiency. Potential stress factors to look out for include: The rigors of production Age Quality of the feed Temperature Salinity pH Each of these can cause an imbalance in the gut, leading to increased disease susceptibility. The subsequent adverse effects on growth rates and immunity can then have negative financial impacts. Protecting their health will provide the most benefit to the farmer. Sustainability Providing food security for future generations requires careful management of our present environment. Sustainable aquaculture is the solution; the FAO announced that by 2030, 60% of food fish will come from aquaculture. The environment needs to be considered in every aspect of production. If we truly understand the needs of fish, quantify the different necessary micronutrients and analyze the composition of feces, we can better understand how to improve water quality. Poor water quality leads to environmental impacts and economic losses that can be avoided by carefully selecting a balanced selection of supplements that support a healthy culture system and environments for the future. RAS environments and the move from marine-based ingredients, as discussed above, have made positive impacts, and all of these will provide access to sustainable marine protein sources for future generations.

October is National Pork Month in the US. Traditionally, this was the time of the year when pigs were to be marketed. Now we use this time of the year to thank producers for everything they do for the agriculture industry. Pork is the most consumed meat globally, so pork producers play a major role in helping us feed the world. Each market hog represents about 371 servings of pork. That makes for hundreds of meals that feed families from the US all the way to China, and plenty of places in between. As the global population continues to grow, pork producers will play an even more important role in the future.

Ironically, it is often the segmentation of the beef system that results in periods of stress. These stressful times often fall around transition intervals, when cattle move from one phase of production to the next. Weaning and feedlot receiving are two transition periods during which calves will experience multiple stressors. Prolonged exposure to stress has negative impacts on calf performance, and these negative effects can result in long-term issues. When you consider the long history of the beef sector, stress is a relatively new issue being examined and discussed by those in the industry. In recent years, scientists and producers have begun to realize the impact that stress can have on calf performance. Fortunately, however, there are solutions for mitigating stress for your cattle during transitions. First, it is important to understand what can cause stress, as well as the consequences of that stress. Stressors that can occur during weaning and receiving include: Separation from the dam The social stress of being removed from the mother can be significant. One management practice that gradually weans calves is fence-line weaning. This technique involves placing weaned calves and dams in adjacent pastures that allow calves to be able see their mothers while being physically separated. Make sure you have sturdy fences with no gaps to prevent calves from crawling through to the other side. Transportation It’s inevitable: At some point, cattle will need to be moved. There are many ways that producers can work to reduce stress during transportation — but similarly to humans travelling to new locations or making a big move, this major transition will likely lead to schedule changes and disruptions, changes in eating patterns, etc. Commingling When groups of cattle are mingled together, they can expose each other to new pathogens. Even if the animals are on the same ranch but are from different pastures, producers need to consider a commingling strategy. Unfamiliar diets Going from their mothers’ milk to feed might feel like a stark transition to some calves. The tips later in this article explain how to get calves to the bunk and help them transition to a new, healthy, nutrient-dense diet. Stress can have consequences on production, including: Impaired growth. Stress causes muscle breakdown and can slow the growth of your cattle. Suppression of immune functions, which can lead to a decreased ability to resist infection and an increased susceptibility to getting sick. Altered behavior, like reduced feed intake. A wholistic view of beef production is necessary to identify where leverage points exist within the production system. Recognizing leverage points allows for a more effective application of management practices to minimize stress and improve performance. In beef production, the most effective approach to minimizing stress is a preventative one. Implement practices that will help you foster and maintain a resilient herd. Resilient calves are going to be able to handle the periods of stress that are inherent within the beef system. The key to building resilient calves is implementing proactive management practices. Outlined below are five easy and practical management tips that will help you produce resilient cattle. 1. Vaccinate prior to shipping. Work with your veterinarian to establish a vaccination program prior to your animals being commingled and shipped. A vaccination program is essential to building a healthy immune system prior to animals being exposed to novel pathogens in a new place and when surrounded by other animals. 2. Castrate animals as early as possible. Castration is a stressful but generally necessary management practice. Research has shown that animals experience less stress when they are castrated at a younger age. Some producers will castrate at birth, when they tag or maybe when they take cattle out to grass. Whatever fits into your management schedule, getting your animals castrated early will allow them to recoup before other stressors manifest throughout the following transition stages. 3. Minimize commingling. Just like with humans, anytime you bring animals from different sources together, you run the risk of exposing them to pathogens. You can reduce this risk of exposure for calves by being strategic about minimizing mixing between sources of cattle. There is also an element of social stress as the newly commingled animals work to establish a pecking order. 4. Expose calves to feed bunks and water troughs. Familiarize your animals with feed bunks and water troughs prior to shipping. This can help reduce stress during feedlot arrival, as getting calves to feed bunks prior to shipping will help them get onto feed quicker. The sooner they get on feed and start consuming water, the better they will bounce back from transportation stress. 5. Proper nutrition is essential. When transitioning cattle, it is important to make sure that their nutritional requirements are being met. Meeting the cattle’s protein, energy and trace mineral requirements is essential for their immune function and growth. During periods of stress, it is common for animals to reduce their feed intake. In these cases, providing diets that are more nutrient-dense to compensate for reduced intake is recommended. It is unrealistic to think that we can eliminate all stress from the production system, but we can minimize the duration and severity of the stress that animals experience. When utilizing these management techniques, consider a schedule that exposes calves to stressors gradually, rather than all at once. When calves feel high levels of stress and no mitigation strategies are used, they can experience critical setbacks. The most important reason to help calves through periods of stress is to set them up for success for the rest of their life — ultimately leaving you with healthy animals, a healthy reputation and a healthy bottom line.

That may not seem significant, but add in all the other costs that come with owning a pet and the total spent per year reaches a high number pretty quickly — and that does not even include the many non-bank-account-related costs that can pile up. When it comes to determining the value of the food they feed their furry companions, pet owners rarely consider overall pet food digestibility. Why is that value important? Well, pet food that is formulated with excess protein and/or poorly digestible micronutrients will not be used by the animal. This means that not only is the pet receiving a lower level of nutrition, but more waste is also being excreted by the animal, which has environmental implications. Improving pet food digestibility, however, does not need to be a challenge. One solution — Yucca schidigera extract (YSE) — is known for both its health and environmental benefits. Let’s dive in to how this additive can help improve your pet food company brand. Protein is a large player in pet food digestibility First things first: Pet food digestibility refers to how much food is actually digested, used and absorbed by the animal. Higher digestibility values are desirable because this means that the pet is receiving a greater amount of nutrition from the bag of food, which translates to less poop and better health. Generally speaking, a digestibility of around 80% for is average pet food; anything below 75% is considered very poor-quality food, and anything above 80% is considered exceptional. To take this full-circle, this means that, on average, 20% of what’s in the pet food bag will be excreted as waste by your dogs and cats. Protein is just one nutrient involved in digestibility, but when it comes to dogs and cats, it could be argued that protein receives the most attention. Many of us know that absorbing the proper levels of essential amino acids is crucial for good health, and since our pets typically eat the same things day in and day out, it is important that their protein requirements are met by their everyday diet. That being said, when it comes to protein, it is important to consider not only how digestible the source of the protein is but also what happens to protein once it has been ingested. Protein digestion in dogs and cats begins in the stomach with hydrochloric acid and pepsin, which break down protein into polypeptides. As the polypeptides travel to the small intestine, the pancreas is triggered to release more digestive enzymes, which break the polypeptides into tripeptides, dipeptides and single amino acids. These small peptides and amino acids are absorbed through the walls of the small intestine and travel to the liver, which distributes amino acids throughout the body. If there is an excessive amount of protein in the diet and not all of it can be digested, it will be excreted by the animal. Additionally, if there is an excess of amino acids in the liver, the body will begin to deaminate them or break them down into a carbon skeleton and ammonia. The ammonia will then enter the urea cycle and will eventually be excreted from the body in the form of urine. Overall, protein can be an expensive ingredient both in the bag and for the environment, which is why using additives to improve pet food digestibility may be a viable solution. Yucca schidigera is rich in steroidal saponins The Yucca schidigera plant is native to Mexico and has been used medicinally in various ways in both humans and animals for many years. Many of the yucca plant’s effects are attributed to its various physiologically active compounds, such as steroidal saponins and polyphenols like resveratrol. Saponins are substances that foam up when added to water, which is why they are often added to soaps. When ingested in small quantities, it is thought that saponins have a “scrubbing” effect on the mucous membranes of the GI tract, which can aid in the assimilation and absorption of nutrients. Saponins also have binding abilities; it has been suggested that they are able to bind to ammonia in a saponin-ammonia complex and pass through the GI tract unabsorbed and into the feces. While more research is needed to better understand these mechanisms, it is certainly an interesting solution for helping reduce ammonia concentrations and odor in feces and urine. Furthermore, polyphenols, especially in combination with steroidal saponins, have been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antibacterial and anti-protozoal properties, which indicates that using YSE in the treatment of arthritis and other inflammatory conditions could be beneficial. Yucca for dogs and cats Research in other production animal species has shown positive results associated with using YSE. In poultry houses, for example, the addition of YSE to diets has been shown to reduce fecal odor and ammonia excretion, and in broilers, YSE has been shown to increase feed efficiency, growth rates and survivability. Yucca schidigera supplementation has proven to be valuable for enhancing animal welfare conditions in cattle and pig production, as well. While our pets are not being used in production settings, wouldn’t it be great if there was a natural way to reduce their fecal odors? A study in dogs showed that including YSE in high-protein diets was effective for reducing ammonia concentrations and fecal odors compared to diets with no added YSE. In cats, studies have shown that applying the liquid form of YSE (as the product De-Odorase) directly to cat litter boxes can help eliminate litter box odor by up to 40% through its ability to reduce the levels of ammonia that have been excreted. Additionally, because of saponins’ foaming properties, YSE may aid in the digestion and absorption of vitamins and minerals, which will also increase the effectiveness of your pet food and help reduce mineral excretion in the environment. Long-term use of yucca for cats and dogs While more research is warranted, using Yucca schidigera extract in pet food diets does appear to have positive effects in the gastrointestinal tract, contributing to increased digestibility levels of key nutrients like protein, vitamins and minerals. The impact of YSE may even go beyond the GI tract and offer anti-inflammatory benefits, especially in the joints. Increased pet food digestibility has important health, economic and environmental implications. While the increased absorption of nutrients will, of course, positively impact the health of companion animals, it also means that pet owners are receiving more value from the bags of food they are buying, which is always a selling point for your pet food brand. And perhaps most importantly during this era, any efforts to decrease ammonia and/or nutrient excretion could be key for environmental sustainability. At Alltech, we believe in working together for a Planet of Plenty. Our mission is healthier animals and a healthier environment, which is why we have taken measures to ensure that we meet the guidelines put in place by the Pet Sustainability Coalition. Protecting the environment is a worldwide feat, but we can certainly do our part in the pet food industry by considering alternative solutions, such as De-Odorase.

A critical component of reaching this goal is keeping the herd as close to a 365-day calving cycle as possible. To this end, shortening the postpartum anestrus interval and increasing first-service conception rates to reduce the need for cattle rebreeding are key topics of discussion and research within the industry. Both nutrition and body condition affect anestrus and conception, dictating the cows’ ability to rebreed successfully. Identifying and correcting problem cows between calving and breeding is not an easy proposition. As such, the best option is to set a cow up for success before calving by ensuring that her BCS is between 5.5 and 6 and that her nutritional needs are met. Return to estrus The length of the postpartum anestrus is fundamental to determining the calving interval. Given a typical 283-day cow gestation period, cows must have a postpartum interval of 82 days to produce one calf every 12 months. Cows cycle from anywhere between 30 to 100 days after calving, with nutrition and cow age contributing to the anestrus length. In beef cows, the uterus returns to its non-pregnant size by around 30 days post-calving. Before cows are ready to cycle normally, an additional 10 days is required to complete the uterine involution. Beef cows that calve early in the season and cycle early have better chances of fully completing their uterine involution and returning to their normal cyclicity before the start of the breeding season. Cows that are cycling before starting the breeding season are most likely to conceive on first breeding — and within the first 21 days of the breeding season. Research has also shown that the nutritional requirements for beef cattle in late gestation affect the cow’s health and return to normal cyclicity. The importance of body condition scores and nutrition in relation to conception and pregnancy rates has been thoroughly studied, with results indicating that: Cows need access to sufficient protein and energy to calve with a BCS between 5.5 and 6. Not only is being in the proper condition important for allowing the cow to produce high-quality colostrum, but this BCS must then be maintained throughout the breeding season. Underconditioned cows are slower to cycle, skewing the 365-day calving cycle, and cows that lose condition between calving and breeding are significantly less likely to conceive. Immediately following calving, the cow is using the nutrition she is provided with to recover from the stresses of the gestation period and calving, as well as to produce milk for her new calf. Only after those needs are met will the cow redirect her energy and nutrients toward preparing for the next breeding season. A significant body of external work supports the use of fat supplementation to enhance reproduction, generally in relation to managing cattle BSC and/or avoiding a negative energy balance in transition animals. In these cases, oleic acid (C18:1) may be the preferred fat source, as it boosts energy being partitioned toward the cow’s body reserves. Alternatively, stearic acid (C18:0) is preferentially used as an energy source, and dietary supplementation may reduce the cow’s reliance on mobilizing her body reserves. All fat feeding should be carefully considered — especially the type of fat and the timing of the feeding, as there are instances in which supplemental fat has reduced reproductive efficiency by increasing anestrous, reducing intake and, in turn, the energy balance, or inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. Conception success and embryo mortality A lot of attention is given to conception rates in beef cattle. However, research from Ft. Keogh in Montana indicates that 90–100% of cows will conceive at first breeding and that it is actually early embryo mortality that gives rise to many open cows. Approximately 25% of cows suffer embryonic loss before the 28th day of their gestation period, with a further 8% of pregnancies lost before day 42. Unlike late-term pregnancy losses, early embryo mortality is often not noticed on the farm. These losses are often miscategorized as cows that didn’t catch on the first round of breeding. Embryo mortality is estimated to cost U.S. cattle producers $1.4 billion annually as a result of open cows, lost productive days and rebreeding costs. Embryo survival is affected by a variety of factors, including maternal and fetal nutrition, genetics, maternal stress, parity and health. As a result, research examining this issue is limited, and often, no clear answer for reducing embryonic loss is determined. How nutrition affects reproductive success Balancing energy and protein in cow diets is important, as lower conception rates are often observed in cows with very high dietary protein intakes. Excess protein can increase the urea concentration in uterine secretions, which results in elevated prostaglandin levels. As prostaglandin is a signal for the body to return to cyclicity, this mechanism may be partly responsible for early embryonic losses in some herds. As with body condition maintenance, research indicates that fat supplementation may additionally have a direct impact on reproduction. Dietary fat has been reported to increase follicle formation in super-ovulated cows, possibly by increasing the serum insulin levels as a mediating step. Luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion, which triggers ovulation and CL development, is controlled in part by an animal’s energy status; thus, fat supplementation that enhances the energy balance will also aid in LH regulation. Dietary fat supplementation has also been reported to increase serum progesterone. A poor-quality CL or insufficient progesterone can both be responsible for pregnancy losses before implantation, particularly in cows that are bred on their first cycle after calving. This once again highlights the importance of early calving to provide cows sufficient time to complete their anestrus and return to normal cyclicity before the start of the breeding season. Beyond energy and protein, trace minerals — such as copper, zinc, manganese and selenium — play key roles in health, metabolism and the general nutritional requirements of beef cattle. Sub-clinical deficiencies in trace minerals can lead to reduced cyclicity and diminished reproductive health. Minerals impact colostrum quality and calf immunity, but their value for the cow should also not be forgotten. Optimizing trace minerals can aid in maintaining optimal uterine health by reducing the risk of: Metritis. Retained placentas. Other adverse events that lengthen the time needed for uterine involution and a return to normal cyclicity. Nutrigenomics research has also shown that minerals affect several metabolic pathways related to the preparation of the endometrium for implantation. Other factors affecting success The period before the start of the calving season is a good time to go over your herd health plan. Connect with your veterinarian and other experts to ensure that your management and vaccination programs are in line with the best practices for your region. This is also a good time to make sure that your recordkeeping is up to date. Diagnosing breeding and reproductive issues is often an exercise in looking back. Working from accurate records can make the difference in identifying the underlying causes and developing a plan to prevent them next year. The bottom line Beyond the importance of individual nutrients, timing the supplemental feeding of cows correctly is important. The last 50 to 60 days of the cow’s gestation period are well-known to be critical for colostrum quality, as well as calf health and growth — but preparation for calving and rebreeding go hand in hand. As it takes time for nutrients to be absorbed, metabolized and take effect in the animal, a feeding program to support reproductive soundness and breeding-related stresses should begin before calving and continue through the confirmation of pregnancy. A few key indicators to monitor are the percentages of mature cows calving during the first 21 days of the calving season and of late-season-calving cows. If either of these metrics run above average, it is time to take a close look at your calving and breeding season program. Simply put, cows need to be set up for successful rebreeding before calving. Waiting to think about the breeding season until after the calf hits the ground is too late to affect major change in your cow herd’s performance.

With estimates asserting that mammals contain around 10 times more bacteria than cells in their bodies — and 1,000 more microbial genes — the importance of a healthy gut cannot be overstated. While many of us have heard about prebiotics and probiotics for dogs and cats, the new term on the block is “synbiotics,” which are simply an effective and beneficial combination of pro- and prebiotics for cats and dogs. Current research shows that the right combination product could be a game changer in pet food diets. How do prebiotics and probiotics for dogs and cats work together? Here’s a quick refresher: Probiotics are consumable live microorganisms that have beneficial effects when fed in the appropriate concentrations. Prebiotics are fiber or fermented ingredients that pass through the GI tract undigested and positively influence the microbes in the gut. In simple terms, probiotics are good bacteria, and prebiotics help feed those good gut bugs. Synbiotics were created as specific combinations of pro- and prebiotics that work well together. Basically, synbiotics are selective strains of bacteria with specific prebiotics that best support those microbes. Once in the body, synbiotics can act in various ways to support health. What do prebiotics do in the body? Upon being ingested, prebiotics pass through the animal’s stomach and small intestine without being broken down by hydrochloric acid or digestive enzymes. Once they reach the large intestine, prebiotics get to work as the “fuel” for the good bacteria in the gut. Prebiotics work together with probiotics to maintain a delicate balance and diversity of organisms in the GI tract. As probiotics are fueled, the body reaps more benefits. Additionally, as prebiotics are fermented and used by probiotics, short-chain fatty acids — such as butyrate and other postbiotics — are generated. These postbiotics are used by the cells of the GI tract as a nutrient source, which further contributes to a healthy gastrointestinal tract. What do probiotics do in the body? Different probiotic strains have different mechanisms of action in pets. Some examples of how probiotics can influence health include: Competing with and displacing bad bacteria in the GI tract by attaching to the intestinal lining Producing antimicrobial substances like fatty acids Inactivating toxins Up-regulating the production of beneficial metabolites Enhancing immune system function Supporting the integrity of intestinal epithelial cells While many strains of probiotics are used in dogs and cats, some of the more common and widely researched include Enterococcus faecium, Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacterium spp. animalis. Multiple studies have shown that the gut bacteria composition of dogs experiencing digestive diseases, such as chronic diarrhea and inflammatory bowel disease, is altered compared to the gut bacteria of healthy dogs, which suggests that probiotics for dogs with diarrhea and other dysbiosis-inducing conditions may be one solution for better health. What benefits do synbiotics provide? As stated above, the whole point of synbiotics is to create one combination product that provides a net benefit for the animal based on synergistic pre- and probiotics. Research trials involving pre- and probiotics for cats and dogs that study the most effective mixture of strains are limited, and the results of the trials that have been conducted vary greatly due to the myriad ways to test changes in the gut microbiome, as well as the different concentrations of beneficial bacteria and fiber being offered and the timing of administration with respect to other foodstuffs or medications. That being said, let’s look at what we do know. One study in healthy, trained sled dogs found that a synbiotic that included E. faecium, Bacillus coagulans, L. acidophilus, and multiple prebiotics and vitamins led to an increase in Lactobacillaceae bacteria and the concentration of butyrate, as well as a decrease in diarrhea. In cats with chronic diarrhea, administration of a proprietary synbiotic blend improved fecal scores significantly after only 21 days. Several studies have investigated the use of synbiotics in cats in conjunction with clindamycin, an antibiotic known to induce significant GI changes and distress in both pets and humans. In one trial, the use of a synbiotic with clindamycin in previously healthy cats illustrated synbiotics’ potential ability to mitigate some loss of beneficial bacteria. Additionally, the cats receiving the synbiotic also seemed to have altered levels of polyamine synthesis. Polyamines aid in the repair of the intestinal lining and have anti-inflammatory properties, so this is particularly interesting and will require more research to fully understand. While the science continues to evolve, what we already know for sure is that supporting the microbiome and continually improving the gut ingredients available for pets will be hugely important in differentiating pet food brands. How to market synbiotics Adding a winning combination of probiotics and prebiotics to pet food diets is not only advantageous for good gut health and an optimal pet immune system but could also be profitable for businesses. With pet parents always looking for an “edge” for their pets, adding a custom combination product that fits your brand’s needs is crucial for brand awareness and recognition. In a crowded marketplace, the smallest ingredients in the bag are often the biggest market differentiators. Additionally, in the human nutrition marketplace, the idea of synbiotics is becoming more and more mainstream, which means that people will soon be looking for this word on pet food packaging. When marketing synbiotics to consumers, here a few tips: Identify the main reason why your company chose these particular strains of bacteria and supportive fiber. Boil your main “why” into less than 10 words for each strain or fiber source. Educate consumers so that they understand why your brand has selected these particular ingredients and why what you are offering is different from other brands. Communicate obsessively via your channels. If it feels like you are repeating the same language, then you are doing it right! Most people need to hear something at least seven times before it really solidifies as fact in their brains. As a company founded on science, Alltech’s technologies continue to be researched as extensively as they have for the past 40 years. We can help identify the custom blend of ingredients that would best serve your pet food brand based on your unique needs, processing techniques and marketing strategies.

He has consulted on farms throughout North America, focusing on everything from feed quality’s impact on animal performance to storage forage management and mold, yeast and mycotoxin management. He regularly visits farms for routine quality monitoring and to help with troubleshooting challenges. You may wonder what a day in the life of an on-farm forage specialist looks like, so I’m here to share my story. The late founder of Alltech, Dr. Pearse Lyons, always said everyone is in sales, and that is very true. We come from all types of backgrounds: Some grew up on farms; some didn’t. Some live far away; some live next door. I may not be a typical salesperson, selling products as I travel from farm-to-farm, as I’m more focused on providing a service and sharing information about products that can bring value to you as the end user. Life on the road My day may start a little different than most corporate salespeople, but similar to them, I spend more than 100 nights a year in hotels across the country. I wake up hoping to catch the free continental breakfast if I didn’t have a 3 a.m. farm visit scheduled, as we all know when working with animals: They don’t understand clocks. My truck is my office, and it greets me each morning with a smell I can’t really put a finger on, even though it is thoroughly cleaned each week if not daily. Sometimes the hotel will even leave a hose and bucket out for me when I arrive. My driver’s seat has a perfect fit to my backside, as I crank out 50,000-plus miles per year down the highways and gravel roads meeting new people, visiting customers and seeing the country through the windshield. A typical day for me will include multiple farm visits and many miles on the road. The first farm could be a forage audit where I’ll be checking the overall quality of the feed for the cows. This would be scheduled as a routine visit, and I’ll stop by every few months to make sure the feed going to the cows is clean and the cows are performing to the best level they can with what they have. I’ll spend some time evaluating the forages, looking and digging through feedstuffs looking for potential issues. We use correct infrared (IR) imaging for organic material to look for invisible hot spots, such as the growth of molds and yeast. I may have to shake out the forages or TMR to check processing and take manure samples to compare how the diets look to how it comes out the back end. After a brief talk with the owner of the operation about production and the upcoming harvest, samples may need to be pulled and sent off to the various labs to look deeper for any issues. Expecting the unexpected The next stop may be last-minute and unscheduled, as a vet or nutritionist saw my truck at the gas station and needs a second set of eyes on why a group of cows had a hemorrhagic bowel syndrome (HBS) outbreak or a butterfat crash, or maybe weights on the feedlot steers took a slump and the pens are all getting loose and they went off-feed. Troubleshooting has become a big part of my day-to-day work. Spending many years watching, learning and working with other experts and understanding why certain contaminated feeds cause specific issues, you become an expert your customers can call on and trust. Now sometimes Mother Nature can throw a curve ball into feed quality, and that’s where all the travel can come into play. I have been fortunate to see things all over the continent, even the world, and work with an extensive group of international colleagues, so when an issue arises that may not be common in your area, and suddenly it is, hopefully I can be of help. After a busy morning and a few farm visits, it’s lunchtime. Sometimes I’ll enjoy lunch at a small-town cafe with good home-cooking instead of fast food, and sometimes I’ll be joined by a manager, vet, nutritionist and/or other experts for a working lunch to discuss challenges and issues we’ve been seeing. Part-time pilot After lunch, I’m off to fly a drone. I have been flying drones commercially for over three years, focused on forage inventories and crop quality checks. Working with cloud computing systems, I utilize high-end technology and bring it to the farm level to gain a better understanding of silage tons in a pile or shrinkage from harvest on. Then, while I’m at the farm, the owner might mention they are planning an expansion and are wondering if they need to build a bigger feed pad, what the layout should be and what can fit. After taking measurements, 3D modeling and elevations with the drone, I can put together a plan for future feed pad needs. After leaving that farm, I realize I haven’t had a great cell signal all day and, as I make my way down the road to the new hotel for the night, a bunch of phone calls, voicemails and emails from multiple time zones come in, so I start returning calls. The day doesn’t end with a late arrival to the hotel because all of the work that went into today now has to be recorded and sent back in reports and follow-ups to the customers. Cows need milking, cattle need growing, and time doesn’t stop to get the needed information out to each operation. At the end of the day, I hope the services and information I share can bring some value and support to your farm. Your livelihood is in your operation and your animals, and if it wasn’t for hard-working producers, our tables would be empty. You are the ones who grow the food to feed the world, and I can’t imagine doing anything else other than working with the greatest folks out there, you the farmer.

Only when these factors are all accounted for can we begin to see optimal plant production. Proper nutrition plays a key role here, giving the plant metabolism everything it needs to function efficiently. But producers need to find the right balance, as leaving a crop deficient in any of its essential nutrients can leave it susceptible to disease and other debilitating issues. The productive potential of every plant depends solely on its genetic characteristics. In order to reach this potential, plants have specific requirements that must be met. These criteria include: Temperature. Light. Water. Nutrients. Furthermore, each of these factors must be provided to the plant in the quantities and proportions suited to each stage of development, from germination to harvest. In crop management, we use practices that provide the best conditions for plant development. Among these, we ensure that the plant is provided with: Adequate irrigation. Phytosanitary and weed control. Physical preparation of the soil. Correct adjustment of fertility. Finally, we supply the specific nutritional quantities and balances required for each phenological phase of the crop and the productive potential of the chosen genetic material. There are specific mineral elements considered essential for plant nutrition. They participate in some structural or physiological functions of the plant. Without these elements, development and productivity are compromised. In terms of macronutrients: Nitrogen provides more vigorous growth and boosts productivity. Phosphorus maximizes root development and plant longevity. Potassium, magnesium and sulfur intensify photosynthesis and the transport of photoassimilates, favoring a greater filling and maturation of fruits, tubers, pods, stems and grains. Calcium participates directly in the development and growth of plant tissue structures. When it comes to micronutrients, one of the main players to consider is boron. This participates in the formation of the polynic tube, the firmness of the peel of the fruits, the transport of carbohydrates and greater leaf growth. The same can be said for copper, manganese, zinc, chlorine and iron. These also participate in the metabolism of photosynthetic activity. The picture above shows a visual representation of the effect these elements can have on plant production. Of the pictured soybean crops, those provided with the necessary macro- and micronutrients, through the use of Alltech Crop Science products, have a notable greener and more robust appearance. Next, we need to think about the action of the enzyme reductase nitrate, which acts in amino acid production. Amino acids act as a natural chelate or complex. They bind to minerals and other molecules and facilitate increased absorption within the plant. To help promote this action as much as possible, molybdenum is fundamental. This trace mineral also contributes to the germination of pollen grains and helps to optimize fruit maturation and tissue resistance. Nickel is also crucial for similar reasons. It is an essential catalyst for numerous enzymatic activities related to carbon and nitrogen metabolism. In secondary metabolism, deficiency or imbalance of any of these elements will trigger negative processes. Some elements, such as copper, manganese and zinc, are directly related to the activity of antioxidant compounds. These compounds act by reducing reactive oxygen species. The same elements also contribute to better lignification of tissues and lead to metabolic activities related to the defense system of the plant. Deficiency or imbalance in required nutrients will restrict growth and the productivity processes in plants. There will also be adverse effects on the plant’s ability to defend itself, as it will become less resistant to diseases and pests. It is, then, essential to provide and improve the efficient absorption of the specific and balanced quantity of nutrients required at each of the crop’s phenological stages. Alltech Crop Science offers a range of products with amino acid complexing technology that allows increased nutrient absorption efficiency, both for root and foliar application. These will enable you to better meet the plants’ requirements and achieve higher crop quality and productivity levels. It is imperative to focus on the efficient supply of nutrients to plants, regardless of the crop, soil type and climatic conditions. Only when we address this issue can plants complete their production cycle adequately and aim at a more significant accumulation of assimilates. Ultimately, this will lead to them achieving a higher level of their productive potential. This will also result in greater final profitability for the producer.

Here, we will break it down step by step so that you can make sure your horses receive exactly what they need. 1. Determine your horses’ energy needs based on their exercise and training schedule. Before we get ahead of ourselves, it is important to take an honest inventory of your horse’s training regimen. The key word here is “honest” — but we’ll get back to that in a moment. According to The Nutrient Requirements of Horses (NRC), there are four categories of activity level and intensity: Light exercise: One to three hours per week of mostly walking and trotting. Moderate exercise: Three to five hours per week of mostly trotting, with some walking and cantering and some skilled work, like jumping, dressage, cutting or ranch work. Heavy exercise: Four to five hours per week of trotting, cantering, galloping and skilled work. Very heavy exercise: One hour per week of speed work and/or six to 12 hours per week. Generally, the only horses that fit into the “very heavy” category are racehorses, elite endurance horses or three-day-eventing horses, while most other horses fit into the light or moderate exercise categories. It’s very easy for us to overestimate our horses’ workload. Keep in mind that modern horses evolved from animals who often traveled 40 to 50 miles per day! They had to really work for their meals, which is not the case for domestic horses. The reason it is important to be honest with yourself about your horse’s activity level is that if you have a horse in the light or moderate category who you unintentionally feed at the heavy or very heavy level, you will likely be at risk for overfeeding, which can have detrimental and debilitating health consequences for your horse. You may be surprised to learn that some horses who do light to moderate exercise do not require energy in amounts much higher than what is needed for maintenance. On the other hand, some performance horses require up to twice as much energy as a horse at maintenance. It’s all about taking each individual animal’s unique blend of genetics, age and metabolism into account, as well as their exercise intensity and duration. A qualified equine nutritionist can help you determine the winning formula for your horse. 2. Always, always, always start with hay (and a hay test). Energy can be supplied in the diet by carbohydrates and fat. Carbohydrates fall into two categories: non-structural and structural. Non-structural carbohydrates (NSCs) come from sugars and starches, primarily from grain concentrates. Most performance horses require some form of NSC, and while there is no reason to fear feeding sugar and starch — sometimes glucose is necessary! — they do tend to be more problematic for our equine friends. As such, it is important to limit the NSCs in the diet to what the horse really needs based on its age and exercise intensity. Structural carbohydrates, on the other hand, include fiber from forage sources and are one of the most critical components in making sure that the horse’s hindgut functions optimally. Remember: A happy hindgut equals a happy horse. The large intestine in the horse’s digestive tract is home to billions of beneficial microbes that digest fiber and produce volatile fatty acids (VFAs), which are used as a source of energy. This is the reason why hay alone can meet the energy requirements of some horses. Fiber helps keep the large intestine at the correct pH balance and greatly reduces the risk of colic. After all, forage is what horses were designed to eat and should always be fed at a minimum of 1% of the animal’s body weight per day. The forage component of a horse’s diet also takes pasture grasses into account, so be sure to factor in how much turnout your horse receives. If you are feeding performance horses, invest in a hay test, which will tell you the exact nutrient levels and help you determine which nutrients need to be added to the diet (based on equine requirements) in the form of grain and horse supplements. We should also note that good-quality fat is an easy — and, often, safer — way to increase energy in a performance horse’s diet. Fats will be used by the horse’s body during aerobic exercise, which can help save the glucose from NSCs for high-intensity or long-duration exercise. 3. Remember the importance of water and salts. While these nutrients are often overlooked, adequate access to fresh, clean water and iodized salt is crucial for all animals, but especially for performance horses. When exercised in hot, humid weather, horses could lose up to four gallons of sweat per hour! Additionally, horse sweat is hypertonic, meaning that it contains higher levels of electrolytes than what is circulating in the body. Human sweat, in contrast, is hypotonic, meaning that there is a higher concentration of electrolytes circulating in the body than what is in our sweat. This means that giving a sweaty horse plain water will only further dilute the concentration of electrolytes in its body. Given that electrolytes are required to maintain the fluid balance and electrical activity of each cell, they are hugely important for performance! In normal circumstances when a horse is only emitting small amounts of sweat, an iodized white salt block or loose salt, in addition to hay and grain, will do the trick. If weather and exercise — or some other form of stress, like long-distance travel — lead to prolonged, excessive sweating, providing a high-quality electrolyte supplement with potassium, sodium and chloride is a very good idea. 4. Don’t overdo protein. Many horse owners accidentally misunderstand how protein should be used in their horses’ diet. As mentioned above, adding energy (or extra calories) to the diet is done with carbohydrates or fat. While protein and, more specifically, levels of certain amino acids are required for growth, muscle and the maintenance of body systems, protein is an inefficient energy source. Horses have requirements for essential amino acids, the most important of which are lysine, methionine and threonine. This is another reason why investing in a hay test will help you to balance your performance horse’s diet. Horses doing light work can often meet their protein requirements (approximately 10% of their diet) from hay and pasture and the use of a ration balancer. Horses doing moderate to heavy work have higher protein requirements, which can typically be met with commercially fortified grain and/or the addition of alfalfa hay. In general, a protein deficiency is not common in most domestic horse diets; in fact, it is more common for protein to be fed in excess, which will end up as a waste product. If you begin to notice a heavy smell of ammonia in your horse’s stall, this is a telltale sign that you may be overfeeding protein. 5. Help minimize and manage stress. It’s no secret that performance horses endure stress. What we sometimes forget, however, is that this stress can impact almost every system in an animal’s body, from its digestive system to its musculoskeletal system. A well-rounded approach to managing performance horses includes taking all of these systems into consideration. Joint and hoof health: The concussion and force that a performance horse’s limbs must endure is substantial. Providing joint-specific nutrients, like glucosamine and chondroitin sulfate, and hoof nutrients, like organic zinc and biotin, can help protect joints and hooves before damage occurs. Antioxidants: Vitamin E and organic selenium are hugely important components in the performance horse’s diet to help combat muscle damage from the free radicals associated with exercise and metabolism. Immune function: Organic trace minerals are important constituents of joint and hoof health — not to mention that they help promote normal nervous system function and a healthy immune system. Gut health: The stress that performance horses are subject to in the forms of training, travel, new environments and more can absolutely impact their microbiome and cause digestive upset. Additionally, the need for glucose (i.e., NSCs) to power exercise is a reality for many performance horses. Gut nutrients, such as pre- and probiotics, can help minimize digestive distress and maximize safe feedings, travels and training days. The key to feeding performance horses is moderation. No one ingredient or nutrient is beneficial when there is either a deficiency or an excess. Use common sense, pay attention to your horse’s behavior and cues, and seek balance with an equine nutritionist. Alltech’s new line of premium equine supplements was formulated to assist with that balance. Lifeforce Elite Performance was designed to be the only horse supplement you’ll need in a performance setting to promote a healthy, whole-body stress response.

Making time to do the proper planning prior to the start of calving can improve overall animal welfare and can save producers both time and energy. One of the keys to successful calving planning is the anticipation of any possible health challenges that could impact calf and/or overall herd health. Management protocols designed to prevent disease exposure should be considered and implemented prior to the start of calving, and producers should contact their local veterinarians about the potential treatment protocols in the case of widespread disease. One disease complex that producers should develop management strategies for is calf scours, also known as calfhood diarrhea. Scours is the leading cause of early calf death. This illness is the result of inflammation of the intestinal tract, which can be caused by a variety of infectious agents, including bacteria (E. coli or Salmonella), viruses (rotavirus or bovine viral diarrhea virus) and parasites (coccidia). The occurrence of scours can impact profitability via both direct and indirect costs. Direct costs include revenue loss due to calf death, additional labor and medicinal costs, while indirect costs include reduced performance in calves that got sick but recovered. Implementing preventative management practices can prove to be an effective tool for preventing scours infections in a new calf crop. Here are a few strategies to help control scours events: 1. Properly manage calving areas The period of greatest risk for a calf to get scours is the first 10 to 14 days after birth. As such, maintaining clean, dry calving areas is essential for minimizing calf exposure to causative agents. Many causative agents — such as E. coli, Salmonella and coccidia — are found in manure. Avoid overcrowding in calving areas to minimize manure contamination. If the environmental conditions make it hard to maintain dry calving areas, it is essential to provide manure-free, dry bedding areas that are large enough to allow both the dam and the calf to get out of the mud. This is important for maintaining the health of both the cow and the newborn calf. Minimize commingling among herds after calving, especially during the first month of the calf’s life. This will prevent the spread of infection from apparently healthy older calves to younger calves, whose immune systems are more naïve. Keeping calving heifers separated from the older cow herd can also help reduce scours. Heifers tend to have lower-quality colostrum, which can leave their young calves at a higher risk compared to calves from older cows. 2. Isolate sick calves quickly Many causative agents are contagious, so quickly identifying and removing sick calves and their dams is essential to preventing widespread infection. To be able to successfully and quickly remove animals from the herd, producers must first be able to recognize the signs of a scours infection. Diarrhea is the most easily identifiable symptom. Diarrhea is classified as loose, watery stool and may be brown, green, yellow, white or even blood-red in color. Other symptoms to look for include weak suckling reflexes, depression and dehydration, which can manifest as sunken eyes or abdomen. 3. Quickly provide treatment Once sick calves are identified, addressing dehydration should be prioritized as the first method of treatment. Fluids and electrolyte solutions need to be provided to rehydrate calves, as diarrhea can quickly dehydrate young calves and, if left unaddressed, can be deadly. 4. Maintain the proper dam nutrition Establishing the proper dam nutrition begins prior to calving. Meeting their nutritional requirements — including energy and trace minerals — is necessary for dams to be able to produce quality colostrum. Colostrum is the mother’s first milk and is high in nutrients and maternal antibodies. At birth, calves are born with a naïve immune system, so the proper transfer of maternal antibodies to the calf is critical for establishing early calf immunity. 5. Establish a vaccination program Work with your local veterinarian to develop a vaccination protocol that fits your herd and its specific challenges. Scours vaccination protocols can include both dam vaccination (to promote the transfer of antibodies through colostrum) as well as calf vaccination at birth (to support the calf’s naïve immune system). 6. Promote gut health Scours are the result of an unhealthy gut environment — an environment where the beneficial bacteria that reside in the gut are outnumbered by pathogenic bacteria. Supplementing the herd with yeast cell wall products, which are classified as prebiotics, can help promote the growth of the beneficial bacterial and support healthy immune function. The goal of calving season is to produce healthy calves — and the production of healthy calves starts prior to calving. Implementing preventive health management strategies can prove to be both effective and economical for producers.

An inability to dissipate heat causes heat stress in beef cattle and can lead to reductions in growth rate, health, milk production, reproductive efficiency and survival associated with heat stress. These contribute to significant losses to producers. While the cost of heat stress to the livestock industry is difficult to calculate accurately, several estimates have been made. St-Pierre et al. (2003) estimated up to $2.4 billion dollars in heat stress-related losses across all species within the US, with more than $350 million associated with the beef industry. Typically, feedlot cattle are more susceptible to heat stress than cattle on pasture. In the feedlot, heat stress-related animal death costs ~$5,000 per head (Mader, 2002). Since those estimates were made, heat waves have become more frequent. A heat wave in 2006 resulted in the death of 25,000 cattle in California (Nienaber & Hahn, 2007), costing the dairy industry $1 billion (CDFA, 2006). In June 2009, more than 2,000 cattle died during a heat event in Nebraska. Farmers in Iowa reported upwards of 4,000 head of cattle lost in a 2011 heat wave. There have continued to be heat stress related incidents affecting cattle. As research has delved into the effects of heat stress that reach far beyond production measures, it has become clearer that even when cattle do not show signs of heat stress, they may still be negatively impacted. Some hidden costs of heat stress include greater incidence of rumen acidosis, laminitis and dark cutting beef. Further, conception rates, sperm quality, milk yield, gut barrier integrity and immune function are adversely affected. What factors can lead to beef heat stress? While beef cattle are more resilient to heat stress than many other species, they still suffer negative effects. Even cattle exposed to the same environmental conditions and management practices vary widely in their ability to handle high environmental temperatures. Below are some key areas identified as indicators of an animal’s ability to cope with heat stress and suggestions on how to address them. 1. Genetics Bos indicus breeds have greater heat tolerance than continental breeds. Choosing location-appropriate breeds or crossbreds and timing breeding to best suit local conditions can mitigate many heat stress problems for calves. Cattle with dark hides are more susceptible to heat-related issues. In a group of closely related cattle with different hide colors, researchers found a 2°F higher core body temperature in cattle with dark hides. Hair length is considered a moderately heritable trait. The slick gene found in Senepol cattle and Spanish-origin breeds results in a shorter coat and correlates to heat tolerance in cattle. In addition to coat length, the timing of shedding is also a factor. Adjusted 205-day body weight was 24.1 pounds higher in calves from dams that shed by May in a trial by researchers at Mississippi State University and North Carolina State University. Calmer cattle have been shown to be more heat tolerant than excitable ones. This is likely due to reduced stress response to handling, leading to lower metabolic activity and heat production in the animal. 2. Health As cattle do not sweat effectively, they primarily use respiratory cooling to regulate body temperature. Thus, respiratory health is critical to managing a high heat load. Research at the Meat Animal Research Center (MARC) shows that cattle treated for pneumonia any time between birth and slaughter have a 10.5% higher respiration rate under stressful conditions in the feedlot. Cattle undergoing heat stress are more susceptible to illness, but the converse is also true. Cattle in poor health going into a heat event may not have adequate energy reserves to adjust metabolic activity to facilitate body cooling. 3. Production stage A feedlot is generally hotter than pasture due to radiant heat from dirt and concrete pads and the lack of shade and water typically available to pastured cattle. Heavier cattle are at more risk. The development of fat cover reduces the efficacy of heat dissipation mechanisms, with more heat from digestion and metabolism retained in the body. Cattle at the end of finishing should be watched closely for heat stress, as should cows with higher BCS. Adult animals can become heat-stressed at temperatures as low as 80°F if there is high humidity or little air movement. While calves are more heat-tolerant than mature animals, they are still susceptible to heat stress-related reductions in feed digestibility and energy redistribution, leading to lower growth and immunity. 4. Previous exposure to heat Cattle previously exposed to high temperatures are better able to tolerate additional heat events. Cattle producers in southern regions should be aware that cattle brought in from northern areas are likely to be much more sensitive to heat stress. Heat stress can negatively affect the immune function, growth, milk production and metabolic resiliency of cattle, even after the high temperatures have passed. The local environment also plays a role in how well cattle handle the heat. Cattle do not dissipate heat as effectively as other species when temperatures are high. They accumulate a heat load during the day and dissipate heat at night as temperatures decline. When making management decisions in hot weather, remember that a cow’s core temperature peaks two hours after environmental temperature peaks, and it takes at least six hours for cattle to dissipate their heat load. Thus, if nighttime temperatures do not drop sufficiently, cattle will accumulate heat they cannot disperse. Therefore, a temperature-humidity index (THI) alone may not predict cattle heat stress because it does not account for this accumulated heat load. How to manage heat stress in beef cattle The best ways to manage heat stress in cattle involve planning practices that limit stress and provide cattle with cooling methods when needed. The USDA-ARS has excellent resources for forecasting and managing heat stress. Below are some suggestions to keep in mind: When possible, a shaded area should be provided to allow 20–40 square feet per animal, with the shade placed at least eight feet above the ground to allow good airflow. Cattle increase respiration with temperature rises, necessitating higher water intakes. For growing animals, a temperature increase from 70–90°F nearly doubles water requirements. Ensure clean, cold water is available, with at least three linear inches of water space per head. Heat production from digestion peaks 4–6 hours post-feeding. Adjusting feeding times to provide 70% or more of feed in the evening allows cattle to digest during the coolest portion of the day. While windbreaks can be beneficial in the winter, if possible, they should be removed during the summer to allow for better air circulation. Similarly, limiting brush height in pastures can aid in keeping cattle cool. Heavy fly loads will cause cattle to bunch together, exacerbating heat issues. A strong fly control problem is critical for management during hot weather. Watch the weather and, when possible, avoid working cattle on the hottest days and limit holding times where they are bunched or away from shade and/or water. If cattle need to be worked, do so in the early morning while they have low body temperatures and work slowly and calmly to help them manage the multiple stressors of heat and working. Sprinklers can be used to soak animals and aid evaporative cooling. Sprinklers should have a large droplet size, be used intermittently to limit mud formation and positioned away from bunks and feeders. Sprinklers should be considered preventative and require acclimation (once used, they must stay in use). Some aspects of nutrition can also be considered to aid cattle in managing hot weather. Dietary protein should be examined as urea/urine production from excess protein is energetically costly and heat-generating. Similarly, high-forage diets can be problematic, as the heat produced from digesting fibrous material is much higher than that from grains and concentrates. However, cattle are more susceptible to acidosis during heat stress, so concentrate intake should be closely managed. Research indicates that lowering the energy content of the diet will decrease the heat load on the animals, with a general recommendation to reduce the diet energy content by 5–7%. Some feed additives have been proven to aid cattle during heat stress by helping maintain rumen pH balance, supporting digestion and through other actions. These additives can help maintain feed intake and health during heat stress. Ultimately, managing beef cattle is a multi-faceted challenge that requires balancing the specifics of the cattle, environment and facilities of each individual production program.

Many countries have banned the use of antibiotics in animal feed as growth promoters due to concerns about antimicrobial resistance. In other countries, antibiotics that are medically important for humans have been voluntarily or regulated to be removed or significantly reduced in poultry production. There are also places where veterinarians prescribe antibiotics, and sick poultry can still be treated if a veterinarian deems it necessary. With the reduced use of antibiotics in poultry production, many countries have decided to allow the use of chemical and ionophore anticoccidials to help offset some of the common challenges that arise in poultry production. Chemical and ionophore anticoccidials help manage a common and costly parasitic disease in poultry, coccidiosis. Some restaurants and retailers have chosen to only use antibiotic-free poultry (e.g., “raised without antibiotics,” “no antibiotics ever,” etc.), in which no antibiotics can be used during poultry production. Whether antibiotics are reduced or eliminated in poultry production, producers who manage poultry in these systems share the major goals of: 1. Ensuring good intestinal health in poultry to optimize growth performance as well as prevent poultry diseases, such as necrotic enteritis and coccidia. 2. Producing safe, healthy food for the growing global population. How are antibiotics used in global poultry production? The three main programs regarding antibiotic use in global poultry production are: 1. “No antibiotics ever” or “raised without antibiotics”: Poultry that has never been fed any antibiotics (including ionophore anticoccidials). Products from these systems are clearly labeled to differentiate them from other production systems. 2. Reduced antibiotic use: Allows antibiotics not used in human medicine (e.g., chemical and ionophore anticoccidials), excluding medically important antibiotics. This type of production may label the meat in some countries, while it may be the standard production system in others. 3. Antibiotics used as growth promoters (AGP): Some countries still use antibiotics at lower levels with the intent to support poultry growth. However, if producers from these countries are exporting to markets with reduced antibiotic use/“no antibiotics ever” production policies, then they must meet those specific criteria. Why is antibiotic-free poultry production becoming increasingly popular? Consumer concerns about antibiotic resistance: Decades after the invention of penicillin by Sir Alexander Fleming in 1928, antimicrobials came into wide use in the global poultry industry in the 1940s to treat parasitic diseases and specific bacterial infections, as well as to improve growth and efficiency. According to World Health Organization (WHO), antibiotic resistance occurs naturally, but misuse of antibiotics in humans and animals accelerates the process. Antimicrobial resistance can impact both animals as well as humans. Antimicrobial resistance (to anticoccidials and antibiotics) can be found in the poultry flock and create issues when managing or treating an illness within the flock. There is still a debate as to whether antibiotic resistance in agriculture or companion animals strongly influences antibiotic resistance in humans. There is an acknowledgment that human medicine is the primary driver of antibiotic-resistant infections in humans. However, “no antibiotics ever” poultry production in many developed countries has become increasingly popular due to a consumer perception that antibiotic-free produced poultry is superior to conventionally raised poultry, even if that poultry is raised with reduced antibiotic use. Recent regulations to ensure human safety: From a regulatory standpoint, many countries across the globe have introduced policies regarding AGP due to antimicrobial resistance concerns. Some countries brought in overall regulatory change for all poultry production practices; several have made some regulatory changes, while in other countries, the industry voluntarily made changes. Some retailers and restaurant chains around the globe have chosen to produce or purchase poultry meat raised with reduced or no use of antibiotics. Overall, these examples show that the poultry industry continues to do what is needed to meet consumer demands. What are common challenges of antibiotic-reduced or antibiotic-free poultry production? Common challenges that poultry producers face when switching to antibiotic-free are poor gut health, reduced bird immunity and a decrease in growth performance. 1. Gut health One of the producers’ top concerns about not using AGP is leaving the birds more susceptible to gut health issues. A healthy gut is more than just the absence of clinical diseases; it is about sustainably producing birds to reach their full genetic potential. Below is an infographic of a healthy gut that efficiently absorbs nutrients (top image) compared to an unhealthy gut (bottom two images). 2. Poultry immunity and growth performance Another challenge when considering switching from traditional to antibiotic-free poultry production is poultry diseases, especially enteric diseases such as coccidiosis and necrotic enteritis (NE), caused by species of Eimeria and Clostridium perfringens, respectively. Consideration must also go to viral challenges, which may lead to secondary bacterial issues that take advantage of the weakened immune system. In addition to disease, overall poultry health, growth and immune function can be negatively impacted by other stressors, such as feed, water, environmental and behavioral. These stressors, if significant, can themselves create issues. But problems can also develop if there are many small stressors, especially if these are combined with a low, moderate, or high disease challenge. Depending on the challenge levels, the bird’s natural immunity will not be enough to manage the threat. Because of this, it is always better to work on a preventative rather than reactive basis. Prevention must be a holistic approach that considers feed, water, environment and bird management, as well as an implementable feed additive program. Typically, in antibiotic-reduced or antibiotic-free poultry production programs, a combination of non-antibiotic additives are included in the feed or water as alternatives to antibiotics. Examples of alternatives to antibiotics: non-antibiotic feed additives Probiotics (“direct-fed microbials,” “viable microbial products”): Live microbial supplements with defined microorganisms that beneficially affect the host by improving its intestinal microbial balance. Enzymes: Substances produced by a living organism that help convert a less digestible component of feed (e.g., sugar, fiber, protein) into a more easily absorbed form for animals to utilize. Prebiotics: “A selectively fermented ingredient that results in specific changes in the composition and/or activity of the gastrointestinal microbiota, thus conferring benefit(s) upon host health” (ISAPP, 2008). Yeasts: There are 1,500 different yeast species, with a few being used as agriculture feed additives. Saccharomyces cerevisiae can be used in many different forms, including a whole live yeast, the outer yeast cell wall, the inner yeast cell wall and the yeast extract. Mannan Rich Fraction (MRF): A second-generation form derived from nutrigenomics analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae mannan oligosaccharides. Research has demonstrated that MRF can support immune defense, gut microbial health, gut function and development. Organic acids: Acids with weak acidic properties that do not separate completely in the presence of water. Some examples of organic acids are citric acid, short-chain fatty acids (e.g., acetic, butyric acid) and medium-chain fatty acids (e.g., lauric, caproic acid). Each type of organic acid has unique properties and can be used for different purposes in poultry production. Inorganic acids: Mineral acids that contain no carbon atoms and break down completely in the presence of water (e.g., phosphoric acid). Often used to make the pH of water or feed more acidic quickly. Phytobiotics: Plant compounds and extracts from herbs and spices with multiple benefits, including antimicrobial, anticoccidial and immune support. Postbiotics: Soluble, non-viable metabolites produced by a bacterial or probiotic metabolic process that can reduce the gut pH, prohibit opportunistic pathogen proliferation and enhance host health (Aguilar-Toalá et al., 2018). How can producers address the challenges of antibiotic-reduced or antibiotic-free poultry production? Reducing antibiotic use with the Seed, Feed, Weed concept Imagine sowing seeds of crops you want to grow, fertilizing the crops for optimal growth and weeding out other plants that may prevent your crop from growing optimally. Applying this concept to poultry, the Alltech Seed, Feed, Weed (SFW) program aids in reducing antibiotic usage by: Seeding the gut with favorable organisms for improved performance in young poultry. It is crucial to first seed the intestine with the correct bacteria as soon as possible after hatch. Feeding a favorable environment to provide a competitive advantage to favorable bacteria, which are tolerant to acidic environments, unlike most pathogens. Once a beneficial microflora community and intestinal ecology are established, the villi will flourish. The healthier the villi a bird has, the more efficiently nutrients are absorbed, which leads to a better feed conversion rate. Weeding out unfavorable bacteria by selective exclusion. The gut can also contain harmful pathogenic microbes, which can damage the villi. It is necessary to weed them out before they can attach to the gut lining and replicate enough to cause disease. While antibiotics still have a crucial role in disease outbreak incidences, effective gut health management using the SFW program has been shown to reduce the need for antibiotic use in many commercial flocks, as well as enhance performance across several measures. Ultimately, the SFW program helps ensure poultry producers achieve more efficient, profitable and sustainable production. As some producers have demonstrated, focusing on gut health is the foundation for performance and profitability in poultry production. Paired with effective biosecurity, bird, water and farm management, the Alltech SFW solution helps producers get one step further on the path of improved performance and reduced antibiotic use.

Recently, during the Alltech ONE Ideas Conference, Dr. Carlo Sgoifo Rossi gave a presentation titled “Receiving With Ease: Minimizing Stress During the Adaptation Phase.” Dr. Sgoifo Rossi is currently an associate professor in the department of veterinary science and technology for food safety at the State University of Milan. Utilizing his perspective and knowledge of the European beef production system, Dr. Sgoifo Rossi shared some information about the various considerations related to stress and adaptation that producers should keep in mind when implementing feeding programs and management practices. When cattle are undergoing a transition like weaning and receiving, they experience stressors, including: Transportation Interactions with other cattle Interactions with humans Changes in nutrition These stressors can have a major impact on cattle and can lead to such issues as changes in their immunodeficiency, reduced rumen motility, altered nutrient absorption, increased nutrient requirements and an upsurge of mineral excretion by the kidneys. Receiving stress can lead to BRD Regarding immune function, one common but highly concerning issue is bovine respiratory disease (BRD), which can strongly affect the performance of cattle. As illustrated in Figure 1, cattle who arrive and are treated for BRD can exhibit a decrease in average daily gains. It is also important to understand that animals who experience BRD often produce meat with lower marbling and quality grades. Considering all of these factors, mitigating BRD is important not only for the animal’s quality of life but for the producer’s bottom line and the consumer’s satisfaction. Appropriate sanitary conditions make a difference While the health of newly arriving animals is impacted by their location of origin, it is also greatly affected by the sanitation and management of the receiving location. According to Dr. Sgoifo Rossi, “The type of vaccination, the type of antibiotics used (and) the type of anti-parasitic product can affect the sanitary conditions of our animals.” Dr. Sgoifo Rossi encouraged producers to approach sanitation with an understanding of their specific herd and facilities and posited that, for some beef production systems, the strategy of going “all-in and all-out with cleaning and disinfection” is the best approach. Nutrition is critical in the cattle business When talking about management, we must be sure to properly feed and rehydrate the cattle upon arrival. Ensuring that clean drinking water is readily available and being conscious of the arrival diet are both crucial. Feeding the arrival diets in small amounts multiple times a day is recommended, as this will reduce competition among the animals, giving each of them an opportunity to receive adequate amounts of protein and energy. Arriving cattle can sometimes be considered high risk, making this a critical period for helping them recover properly and get back to normal rumen functionality. Studies have shown that the appropriate arrival diet should have a crude protein and dry matter composition of less than 13%. “Several studies show that if we improve the crude protein level of adaptation diets or the energy level of adaptation diets, we increase not only the incidence of morbidity but also the severity of morbidity and, consequently, the risk of mortality,” Dr. Sgoifo Rossi said. Additionally, with the arrival diet typically being richer in forage and higher in fiber, reducing the chop length of the fiber will also reduce the likelihood that animals will sort through the ration. This is important, because sorting can cause cattle to eat too much starch or protein, which can lead to fluctuations in the pH level. Consider all of the nutritional needs of arriving cattle Unsurprisingly, it is also important to consider the nutrients available in the arrival diet. Providing new-arrival animals with the proper nutrients will improve their immunity, digestibility, and energy and protein balances. To recover rumen and immune system functionality in newly arrived cattle, it is important to consider diets that include the following: High levels of digestible fiber Yeast Mannan oligosaccharides (MOS) Slow-release nitrogen Vitamins Minerals As mentioned previously, the arrival period is so critical for getting cattle right. Vitamins, minerals and other supplements can help improve their feed and can be fundamental in helping these cattle adapt to their new home. In his presentation, Dr. Sgoifo Rossi mentioned that studies have shown that organic zinc and selenium, live yeast and mannan oligosaccharides can be huge players in the reduction of morbidity and mortality in these potentially high-risk cattle. Too often, producers and nutritionists underestimate the importance of these ingredients, leading to negative results. Dr. Sgoifo Rossi shared a study completed in Italy that examined the mineral status and mineral plasma levels of cattle after arrival. This trial focused on the evaluation of various mineral levels in the blood immediately after arrival. As shown in Figure 2, 83% of new-arrival beef cattle were in a deficient or sub-deficient condition regarding their copper availability, and 30% displayed deficient or sub-deficient zinc availability and reserves. Weather can be a stressor Weather can play a significant role in cattle stress, and more thoughtful management practices should be implemented with the weather in mind. Spring, summer and fall are less of a concern when it comes to sanitation management, but winter is a critical period for sanitation. Producers often forget to consider the relationship between temperature and humidity during the winter and how it can lead to cold stress. This can create a potentially dangerous environment for cattle and can result in increased incidences and more severe cases of BVD. As shown in Figure 3, low-temperature, high-humidity environments can create a risk area where sanitation conditions are an issue, leading to a slower adaptation for arriving animals. As previously mentioned, there are challenges leading up to and during the receiving period that can result in the highest risks of morbidity and mortality. Implementing the proper sanitation and vaccination protocols, providing sick animals with antibiotics, being proactive about their nutrition, and understanding which management practices to use based on the origin of your cattle, as well as their transportation details and the time of year, are all effective ways to mitigate any potential challenges associated with receiving cattle.

Africa is getting educated now. Africa is where you need to be. Africa is where you (should) look to grow your food.” That’s what Dr. Ruth Oniang’o, a keynote speaker at the 2021 Alltech ONE Ideas Conference (ONE), used to tell her fellow board members when she served on the board of Nestlé. A professor of nutrition and former member of Parliament in Kenya, Dr. Oniang’o has spent her career advocating for food and nutrition policies that will feed the world’s fastest-growing continent and increase access to food across Africa. Over the past several decades, many African countries have made great strides in reducing chronic hunger, malnutrition and weight loss — but with one in five African people still “chronically undernourished,” including millions of children, there is much more work left to be done to help turn African communities into examples of food security. Dr. Oniang’o’s approach is a holistic one. Beyond her focus on growing healthier crops and strengthening food assistance, her work is transforming society through avenues that most people may not think of when it comes to food and nutrition. 1. Empower women The first step to transforming how Africa grows and eats is identifying who’s behind the continent’s current food production. “In Africa, it’s mostly women who are producing food,” said Dr. Oniang’o during her keynote address at ONE. “And I said, ‘No wonder we are a hungry continent. Women are already overworked. They bring up children, many children. They have to farm. They have to feed them.’” We cannot solve hunger in Africa without women, Dr. Oniang’o argued. By elevating their value in society and providing them with the education and resources they need to manage their farms, their families and their health, we can create conditions that will allow African women to grow more food, feed a greater number of people and share their knowledge with others. 2. Promote adult literacy One major key to that empowerment is literacy. According to data from the United Nations, the adult literacy rate in sub-Saharan Africa is around 63% — meaning that one in three adults in the region, or some 182 million people, cannot read. And while some African countries have higher literacy rates, many are actually lower: South Sudan’s 35% literacy rate is among the lowest in the world. Promoting adult literacy, both via governments and NGOs, leads to more educated adults across Africa, which has positive, long-term effects related to food, nutrition and families. “Adult literacy is so important,” said Dr. Oniang’o, “because when women are educated, they will not want too many children. They'll want to do other things. They'll take good care of themselves, take care of their family, and therefore, their children will survive better. They want a better life for themselves, and they know what foods to provide to the family.” 3. Provide resources directly No matter where they are in the world, farmers need resources of all kinds, from education and research to funds to help purchase seeds, nutrients and supplies. Providing resources directly to farmers is one of the fastest ways to improve their conditions and crop yields, as well as the health and nutrition of their families and communities. And providing resources to farmers doesn’t just help build individual and community food security — it can help alleviate poverty, too, since extreme poverty and hunger have “a cyclical relationship” in Africa, according to the United Nations. Hungry people have a hard time working, and people who can’t work have a hard time affording food. “If we do agriculture properly — if we distribute our resources properly — we can get people out of poverty,” said Dr. Oniang’o. “As someone who has worked with farmers right on the ground, it doesn't take a whole lot. It doesn't take a whole lot to transform a community and to make them have more food and to have them eat better.” 4. Look after the soil We can’t increase the production of food sources without addressing soil health. Unhealthy, malnourished soil leads to malnourished crops that wither instead of thriving. Finding ways to improve soil health — like rotating in legumes to boost the nitrogen in the soil and supplementing malnourished soils with nutrients — helps foster healthier crops and establishes farming practices that will be more sustainable over time. Dr. Oniang’o first realized the importance of soil health when she saw crops that looked weak and frail, mirroring the effects of malnutrition in adults and children in Africa. She advocates for ways to help farmers improve their soil health, starting with technologies like rapid soil tests to help farmers identify deficiencies within their soils — a prerequisite to growing stronger, healthier crops. After all, as she said, “If the soils are not healthy, human beings cannot be healthy.” 5. Build and support smart partnerships “Nobody can do this alone,” said Dr. Oniang’o. “(The) private sector has a role to play. Public-sector government has a role to play. Civil society has a role to play. Everyone has a role to play.” Implementing change on a continental scale cannot be done alone. It takes local groups and national governments to put all of the practices outlined above into place in support of individuals, communities and countries. National and local governments, NGOs, scientists, farmers and private-sector companies all have a role to play. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) notes that “increasing yields for staple crops (in Sub-Saharan Africa) will require greater investment, both domestically and through assistance from donors and international research organizations.” Local groups across Africa know what local farmers need. By listening to these stakeholders, private companies, national governments and international collaborative efforts can find ways to be good partners, bringing about change on a scale that local groups can’t accomplish alone. These partnerships can help decrease food insecurity across Africa and transform the future of the continent for the long term. The future of food in Africa Imagine it: a farmer in Kenya learns to read. She’s able to take advantage of educational materials and research that help her grow her crops more efficiently, with higher yields and healthier soils for her specific growing conditions. She’s given the resources she needs to put these findings into practice, thanks to partnerships between her local government and private companies. She’s able to feed her family and even has a surplus to help feed others, contribute to a food bank or sell for a profit. She’s valued and respected as an expert; she shares her knowledge with other farmers nearby, and she helps build communities that are more food-secure — and the ripple effects continue to spread. By investing in her, we invest in the future of Africa. That’s how we transform the future of food: one farmer at a time. Visit one.alltech.com for more information.

Ebeling’s company, Not Impossible Labs, was born of necessity out of a chance meeting with the family of a locally renowned street artist known as Tempt One. The start of something amazing Tempt was suffering from the debilitating effects of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and had lost the ability to move any part of his body aside from his eyes. His family was desperate for the chance to effectively communicate with him again. When Ebeling learned of this, he asked them why Tempt didn’t have a speech-generating device (SGD) like the one used by theoretical physicist Stephen Hawking. Tempt’s brother informed him that owning such a device was only a possibility if you were wealthy (they weren’t) or had excellent insurance (they didn’t). So, Ebeling — a successful video producer and entrepreneur — offered to buy Tempt an SGD. Naturally, the family was thrilled, and Ebeling, admittedly a bit caught up in the moment, told them he would also figure out a way for Tempt to draw again. Although they were elated, Ebeling was initially worried he had overpromised. Despite this, he began to set things into motion, inviting a proclaimed team of “misfit geniuses and mad scientists” from around the world to live in his home while they worked on a solution, and the EyeWriter was born. It was truly life-changing, giving Tempt the ability to draw for the first time in seven years. Ebeling and his team quickly made plans to open-source the technology associated with the EyeWriter, initially thinking that they’d simply go back to their regular lives afterward. But then, something incredible happened: Time Magazine named the EyeWriter a Top 50 invention of 2010. The Museum of Modern Art asked to put it on display. Award after award started coming in. And Ebeling realized that he could do more to help others in need. Commit, then figure it out Ebeling is on a mission to provide “technology for the sake of humanity.” His mantra? “Commit, then figure it out.” Working with a unique team of innovative thinkers, doers and creators, Ebeling’s Not Impossible Labs designs devices to better the world by giving accessibility to everyone. Driven by the belief that “impossible is a fallacy,” Ebeling began to seek out other ways to help the disabled. And so, Project Daniel — initiated by the story of a 12-year-old Sudanese boy who lost his arms to amputation following a bombing near the field where he was tending his family’s animals — came to life. Worried about being a burden to his family, young Daniel sadly admitted he would rather be dead than alive without arms. Upon hearing this story, Ebeling, who had a 12-year-old son of his own, realized that he had to solve this problem. So, the Not Impossible team set to work and, just a short while later, flew to an active war zone in Sudan, armed with 3D printers, laptops, spools of duct tape and more — all with the goal of building Daniel some arms. This concept had been hatched on July 11, and just four months later, Daniel was able to feed himself for the first time in two years. The Not Impossible team went on to create the first prosthetics laboratories powered by 3D printers. Most prosthetic arms cost around $15,000; Daniel’s cost $100. As Time Magazine said, “It’s hard to imagine any other technology doing more to make the world a better place.” Enlightened capitalism Ebeling reached out to Intel to ask for funding to keep Project Daniel going. They agreed and provided a modest amount in comparison to what they’d spent on other marketing and branding projects. And yet, the thing that ended up doing the most for the company was that little investment in doing good. This led Ebeling to realize that doing good is — quite simply — good. It’s good for companies. It’s good for branding. It’s good for growth — and it’s a great business strategy. The thing is that people want to make a difference. They want to do more. As Ebeling pointed out, “What have we learned in the last two years? It’s reminded us that life is fragile and that we could disappear, just like that.” Many are re-evaluating their priorities and are seeking ways to make an impact in their local communities and beyond. So, Ebeling challenged the audience to consider what they could do for others. “Will you help create advantages?” he asked. “[Because the reality is] when the world benefits, your business benefits. Everybody benefits. This is how you create [meaningful] change. This is [known as] enlightened capitalism.” Tackling future absurdities Since the inception of the EyeWriter and Project Daniel, the Not Impossible team has gone on to design several other astounding inventions that have changed the lives of many, including — but not limited to — a blind skateboarder, a group of deaf music lovers and a former pioneering avant-garde jazz pianist afflicted by the debilitating tremors associated with Parkinson’s disease. During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, Ebeling began to think about how big a problem food insecurity is, even in affluent countries like the United States. “[Over] 50 million Americans struggle daily to put food on the table,” he noted. “One in five kids in America struggles with food insecurity. This is absurd. Why are people going hungry? This makes no sense. We are a wealthy country. We have plenty of food. [I realized] this is a supply chain issue.” So, what happened next? You (probably) guessed it. The Not Impossible team created a solution known as Bento, a platform designed to connect people with readily accessible, nutritious, pre-paid meals from nearby restaurants in a stigma-free manner, all through discreet text messaging. And Time Magazine once again recognized Not Impossible on their best inventions list, making it the only company to ever win that award twice. The why behind the try As Ebeling closed, he remarked, “So, why do we do this? Why do we pull this stuff off? Because we shouldn’t! We don’t have the degrees or the credentials or the diplomas. There is nothing in who we are that drives us to do this aside from beautiful, limitless naivete. We simply didn’t get the memo that we weren’t supposed to be able to do this or pull this off.” “What are you going to do with the blessing of your life?” he continued. “You won the lottery! Are you going to keep it to yourself? Or are you going to try to make this world a little bit better in the short, brief amount of time that you’re here? The one question I want to ask you to consider as you go back to your lives later this week is, ‘Who is your one? Who is the one person in your life that, if you think about it, you could help? Who is your Daniel?’” This. This is how we can work together to make the world a better place. So, don’t wait. Start now. As Not Impossible has proven many times over, even a little effort backed by a passionate purpose can go a long, long way.

People brought and domesticated animals, began using natural resources for food production and required more land. As this growth was happening, global economies and continents became more connected through railways, highways and shipping lanes. Carbon became the main way to fuel the growing economy and growing planet. Consequently, carbon emissions have increased. Agriculture was growing. Scientific breakthroughs were leading the way to a more efficient food system and created the opportunity for the rise of brands and businesses that, today, we call the food industry. The need for agricultural productivity, as well as food production efficiency, led to new farming innovations and a realization about the carbon emissions produced by agriculture. In terms of meat, milk and egg production, farmers began making improvements, responding to the influences and demands of the market. Since the mid-1800s, the amount of fossil fuels being used has increased by 20,000%, while the human population has increased by 1,329%, and the animals being utilized to feed that growing population has increased by far less, at 524%. In fact, to date, 50% more beef is produced in the United States than was being produced in 1960 — but this increase in production is being accomplished with one-third of the number of animals that was required 60 years ago. Although scientific breakthroughs have led to a better understanding of our environment, there has not been an agreement about the culprits of climate change. This story is not unique to North America. Change is happening “One thing that is becoming crystal-clear is that a change has started, and it is going to continue,” said Dr. Lyons. “In fact, we saw that the pandemic actually accelerated this change and the acceptance of the changes that were happening around us. “We believe every challenge can be an opportunity — and, indeed, a gift,” Dr. Lyons continued. “Whatever we believe can become reality, but you won't do things differently unless you see things differently.” Let’s look at some of the innovations being dreamed of and implemented around the world: 1. Giant air purifiers: Nine out of 10 people around the world breathe polluted air, and this pollution accounts for almost 9 million deaths per year. Some engineers are thinking about how we can create giant outdoor air purifiers that are also pieces of art. Perhaps the true beauty is clean air and clean energy. 2. Cooling the planet by filtering excess carbon dioxide out of the air on an industrial scale: Giant air scrubbers in Texas — which could be a common sight by 2050 — use simple chemistry to capture CO2 and pump it into oil wells, which have been drilled dry in the last century. Some of the greenhouse gases that are heating up our planet could be removed with these types of innovations, potentially contributing to a reduced greenhouse effect. 3. Electricity generators using heat from the Earth’s mantle: This is being done on a small scale in Kenya, but it has great future implications for not emitting greenhouse gases into the air at all. 4. Using recycled plastic as a bitumen replacement in road construction: Among the fossil fuels that have already been taken out of the ground, a lot of them have been converted into plastics, which take over 1,000 years to biodegrade. Some of those plastics can be recycled and utilized in road construction, creating a smoother ride, fewer potholes and a longer road life. 5. Solar roadways: Technologies like Gorilla Glass can be used to create solar roadways by protecting solar panels that are used to pave roads, driveways and sidewalks. If these roadways covered the entire United States, they would produce three times the electricity that we need today. 6. Sonic fire extinguisher: As a result of climate change, we’ve seen more and more forest fires burning. To combat this challenge, scientists are working on a sonic fire extinguisher, which can be installed on a drone and works by using sound waves to separate oxygen from the fuel source. 7. Hydrogen as aviation fuel: Since 1990, the carbon dioxide emissions per passenger flight have dropped more than 50%. Nevertheless, the aviation industry is also evaluating new fuel sources, with hydrogen potentially serving as a new, clean aviation fuel. An Airbus commercial-scale hydrogen plane has already taken flight in the U.K. 8. A “blended wing” that serves as both a passenger compartment and a wing for aircraft: With the entirety of a plane generating lift, this could save 20–30% of the fuel currently required for passenger flights. 9. Green algae as a cleaner of the environment and a source of travel: The ability of green algae to eat bacteria is more prevalent than previously thought, and this finding could have important real-life uses related to environmental and climate science. In addition, green algae could also be a fuel source for many different types of travel, including both in the air and on the ground. 10. Gut microbiome genes are linked to array of human diseases: So much of what is happening within our microbiome is linked to human diseases. As we come to understand more about the science, there will be many new ways for us to overcome human health challenges. 11. An antibiotic alternative capable of treating resistant bacterial infections: Scientists at Durham University have improved the current standard alternative to antibiotics (called peptoids) by altering their chemical structure to enhance their delivery into cells and their effectiveness against bacterial infections. These alternatives could help combat the plague of antibiotic resistance. 12. Methane from animal waste can be used to grow single-cell protein for food: People are not only converting methane into energy with biogas digesters but are also utilizing a number of different nutrients and creating single-celled proteins that can go back into food for animals — and even humans. 13. An intelligent trash bin that identifies food types and encourages recycling: Food waste is an area of untapped potential. The intelligent bin could reduce one-third of our food waste before it even leaves the home. 14. A kitchen appliance that turns waste to compost: There are systems being developed today that will allow us to convert our food waste directly into compost that can be used in our gardens. With a single button, Lomi grinds and heats waste to break it down with no smell and turns it into nutrient-rich compost, reducing up to 50% of the waste that would otherwise be sent to a landfill. 15. Microbial tools could improve productivity while limiting environmental impact: There are new tools to help develop specific microbiomes in the gastrointestinal tract, soil and waste-processing systems. As a result, new nutritional and feed supplementation strategies are being created to improve production efficiencies while limiting the intensity of emissions. 16. Measurement tools to assess environmental impact and mitigation strategies: Tools like the E-CO2 farm audit systems, laboratory testing and feed evaluations (Alltech IFM™ and the Yea-Sacc® Value Test), as well as the use of supplementation and pasture management programs to control emissions and the mineral impact on the environment, are critical for reducing our overall environmental impact. 17. Biotic tools for mitigating agriculture emissions and emission intensity: New management systems use filtration to take out methane at the source and potentially use this methane in other agricultural production systems. Manure management, pasture management and pasture nutrition all get back into our understanding of the microbiome and the importance of seeing all of these areas as linked. 18. Using activating enzymes as biological catalysts: Enzymes can help us in many areas, such as improving digestion and feed utilization, beneficially modifying microbiomes in animals and soils, altering fermentation patterns to break down waste and mitigating environmental toxins. “I believe the agriculture industry will create climate-neutral food,” said Dr. Lyons. “We will continue to be one of those core industries that can sequester carbon, and we will be a big part of the answer to climate change.” In closing, Dr. Lyons asserted that no industry could have a more positive impact on the future of the planet than agriculture. “It’s the industry that I'm most excited about, and it’s a great honor to be working in this industry,” Dr. Lyons shared. “We can nourish the world while cooling its climate. We can leave not a footprint but a legacy. What an extraordinary opportunity as we all gather, working together for a Planet of Plenty™.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.

He had undertaken this adventure to support a climber with a broken back who was reaching 18,000 feet via a sled and a team of people all dedicated to helping him achieve his goal. Weihenmayer admitted that while the result of this trip was uplifting and inspirational, the process and path of getting there were literally exhausting. “Accomplishments are fun to talk about,” Weihenmayer said. “What I think doesn’t get talked about enough, though, is the struggle. Because for me, [honestly], it's been a struggle to live this life.” Weihenmayer is no stranger to overcoming obstacles. He began losing his vision at the age of 14 due to a disorder called retinoschisis, but that never stopped him from achieving his goals. He followed a passion for wrestling in high school, going on to represent his home state of Connecticut at the national level. He also discovered a love of rock climbing, which has led him down an exciting and awe-inspiring road — one that has seen him reach the peak of the highest summits on all seven continents, and much more. What he has learned from his life and accomplishments is that overcoming challenges is all about the approach. How we see and perceive these obstacles determines how we work through or past them. Camper or climber? Weihenmayer told the audience that while writing his second book, “The Adversity Advantage,” he learned that there are three types of people: quitters, campers and climbers. Deciding not to dwell on the quitters, he explained that campers are the people who start out with hope, optimism and excitement, but somewhere along the way, they stop. This can be due to fear of the unknown, a lack of confidence after making mistakes, cynicism toward the world or simply exhaustion from constantly running into life’s many barriers. Climbers, on the other hand, are the rare group that never stops going, growing and evolving. They are always moving forward onto the next adventure, challenge and idea, no matter what the world throws at them or the setbacks they endure. The question, however, is this: How do we continue to climb when it is so much easier — and makes so much more sense — to camp? Weihenmayer explained that his own personal journey to becoming a climber began when he first began to lose his vision. When his sense of sight was all but gone, he used what little he had left to watch television. It was then that he learned about Terry Fox, an amputee with a prosthetic leg who ran across Canada. Weihenmayer realized that what drove Fox was a light inside of him, a passion that fed off of the frustrations and challenges of life. From this point on, Weihenmayer decided to stop focusing on everything he had lost and chose instead to look inward, discover his own light and emerge as a stronger and better person. “I was tired of building walls around myself and protecting myself from loss,” he explained. “I wanted to break out of that prison partly constructed by my own fears.” This led to Weihenmayer learning rock climbing. But while he says that this path has proven to be exhilarating and exciting, he admits that there is an aspect that still scares him: the reach. The reach is the trust we must put into the unknown in order to keep moving onward. It allows us to take advantage of an immense number of possibilities that are never seen. However, Weihenmayer also admitted that when we reach, we bring adversity into our lives, and while it may be easier to avoid reaching, it is only by facing this adversity that we can achieve greatness. Weihenmayer continued by giving examples of people he has met who not only face their adversities but use them in incredible ways. He calls them alchemists. “What these alchemists do, I think, is different,” Weihenmayer explained. “They figured out how to seize hold of that storm of adversity that swirls around us to harness its energy and use that energy to propel themselves forward to places they would have never gone to in any other way.” Lava Falls Unfortunately, Weihenmayer explained that even when we have everything in the right place — the drive to succeed, the preparation for the task and a team backing us up the whole way — things still do not always go to plan. This was something he found as he tried to kayak through the Grand Canyon and, namely, the Lava Falls rapids. Weihenmayer explained that everything had been prepared. He had trained for months with his team. They had developed a communication system that would enable him to easily navigate the course. However, on the day they attempted Lava Falls, everything went wrong, and he ended up overturned from his kayak, swimming blind through the rapids. However, Weihenmayer said that he could not let this failure stop him, and that when we get knocked back, we all need to lean in, tap into the light inside us and try again. For Weihenmayer, this meant another — this time successful — attempt at the rapids, but for us all, it can mean the difference between achieving our dreams and never knowing what could have been. “It is not one step that makes a path on the Earth,” he said, quoting Henry David Thoreau. “Nor is it one thought that makes a pathway in the mind. Instead, we step again and again and again towards those thoughts we wish to dominate our lives.” To register for access to on-demand content and more from the Alltech ONE Conference, visit one.alltech.com.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/achieving-greatness-through-blind-faith","title":"\n\n                    Achieving greatness through blind faith\n                    ","date":"May 25, 2022","contentLength":974}},{"pageContent":"People interpret sustainability in different ways. Hence the uncertainty and divisiveness the topic can create in discussions. In contrast with other industries, the agri-food sector has the unique position of being a solution provider when it comes to mitigating emissions and supporting biodiversity in our local environments. Animal feed is integral to profitable and efficient dairy and beef farming. Therefore, feed production has a crucial role in how we lower the environmental impact associated with the food system. Strengthening the links in our chain COVID-19 has emphasized the need for such resilient food systems. Feed production capacity is directly correlated to the amount of food available for human consumption and, indeed, general food security. Alltech’s experience across 128 countries finds that sustainable and efficient feed supply chains are relevant to small-scale livestock production all the way up to some of the world’s largest integrators. A growing challenge for the feed industry is competition with humans for similar feed sources. This challenges the feed additive inclusion to improve rumen efficiency and exploration of bespoke feed ingredients that only ruminants can utilize. Sustainable animal feeding has and is being practiced. Through Alltech’s unique network of eight Alltech IFM™ (in vitro fermentation model) labs around the world, we can verify in greater detail diet efficiency and where scope exists to lower emissions and improve producer profitability. Can you verify that? It is no longer sufficient to simply claim a low carbon footprint for your livestock production system or animal feed. This needs to be supported by repeatable, measurable and verifiable evidence. Alltech E-CO2 has developed the Feeds EA™ model to help feed manufacturers and producers globally measure and lower the carbon footprint of their feed. Feeds EA measures the environmental impact of feed production at the feed mill level by assessing the effects of existing compounds or blends. This is determined by calculating greenhouse gas emissions from production, cultivation, processing, energy utilization and transportation in feed manufacturing. Feeds EA™ can calculate emissions from a database of more than 300 ingredients, including raw materials, soya products, byproducts and additives. In reducing food waste through circular agriculture-type initiatives, we can be confident about the resilience of our food production systems to embrace more efficient resource utilization. This is exemplified in initiatives such as supplementation of byproducts to ruminants and closing nutrient loops. By lowering food loss and waste in our livestock production systems in a verifiable way, we can continue to make a strong case for the sustainable solutions our industry offers in slowing the pace of climate change. Mitigating waste Precision agriculture and the application to animal nutrition has been proven in recent Alltech meta-analyses on dairy (Salami et al., 2021) and beef research (Salami et al., 2020) to lower environmental impact through improved nitrogen utilization in ruminant systems. Optigen® supplementation through dairy diets was shown to: Improve nitrogen utilization efficiency in dairy cattle by 4%, thanks to better nitrogen capture in the rumen. Reduce manure nitrogen excretion by 12–13 g of nitrogen/cow/day. This data suggests, for example, that the use of Optigen could reduce the annual manure nitrogen excretion from the U.S. dairy sector by an average of 51,509 metric tons of nitrogen based on the annual milk output. Simply put, this approach is trying to provide ‘the right amount of nitrogen, at the right time, in the right place’ to help in reducing waste on farms. Results from the meta-analysis also showed that the use of Optigen in dairy diets resulted in a carbon saving of around 54 g of CO2e per kg of milk. When extrapolated to the annual milk output of the German dairy sector, for example, this would be equivalent to a carbon emission reduction of 1.8 million metric tons of CO2e. Such a carbon saving represents 16% of the entire reduction target for German agriculture by 2030. A simulation analysis based on the results of the meta-analysis indicated that feeding Optigen to 1,000 dairy cows would: Increase income over feed costs by $18,000. Reduce the carbon footprint of the herd by 647 metric tons of CO2e. That carbon reduction is the same as taking 424 cars off the road or 436 houses’ use of electricity. The meta-analysis on beef research highlighted how the partial replacement of vegetable protein with Optigen exhibited a consistent improvement in the liveweight gain and feed efficiency of beef cattle. The many positive effects included an average higher liveweight gain (by 8%) and better feed efficiency (by 8%), with the inclusion of corn silage enhancing the effects of Optigen. A simulation analysis based on these benefits indicated that feeding Optigen to gain 440 lbs. in 1,000 cattle would: Reduce the time to slaughter by 9 days. Reduce feed costs by $18,000. Support a reduction in the carbon footprint of the beef unit by 111 tons of CO2e. That carbon saving is the same as taking 73 cars off the road or 75 houses’ use of electricity. Sustainability does not have to come at a cost Lowering the environmental impact from animal feed does not imply lowering revenues for food system stakeholders. From large dairy farms in the U.S. to the 300 million dairy cows predominantly spread across small farms in India, Alltech has firsthand experience of how sustainable solutions have become the non-negotiable in animal nutrition. Profitable farming understandably leads this agenda. With animal feed typically representing the most significant variable cost in producing animal products, there is a business responsibility to ensure we minimize food loss and waste. Animal feed production has humbly underpinned the food system that has enabled global population growth over the last 150 years. It is now time to recognize this unique contribution and how it also serves in discovering and implementing technologies that lower the environmental impact of animal products and support the circular economy. Considering sustainability efforts need to make both environmental and economic sense, don’t miss our related blog 6 tips to stretch protein supplies and lower your feed costs.

It is well-known that supplements containing live yeast can improve rumen fermentation and the digestive process by stabilizing rumen pH and stimulating the growth of beneficial microbial populations. These positive changes can be attributed to growth factors, including peptides, and the effect on the rumen anaerobiosis to create optimal conditions for the rumen microflora. Good rumen function will ensure optimal feed intake and digestive efficiency in dairy cows, while poor rumen function can negatively impact feed intake, health and overall cow performance. Formulating the ration correctly and understanding how the individual ingredients in the ration work together can help keep the dairy cow’s rumen and digestive system functioning properly. How can you ensure that good formulations will lead to the expected results? Published research and decades of use in the field suggest that most dairy diets respond positively to Yea-Sacc®, a yeast culture based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae that stimulates the growth of fiber-digesting and lactic acid-utilizing bacteria in the rumen. These microbial changes directly result in: A stable rumen pH, which is conducive to better fiber digestion and a reduced risk of rumen acidosis Improved feed intake Enhanced milk yield and components However, not all formulation strategies react the same way. As a result, there may be instances in which supplementation with Yea-Sacc does not yield the expected results. To quantify the efficacy of Yea-Sacc for improving rumen fermentation and nutrient utilization for specific dairy TMRs, allowing for greater precision when feeding Yea-Sacc, Alltech created the Alltech IFM™: Yea-Sacc® Value Test (YSVT®). The response of dairy TMRs to Yea-Sacc supplementation may vary depending on the feedstuffs. Formulation models are limited in predicting the effects of non-nutritive feed additives on rumen fermentation, which limits the precision of ration formulation and the prediction of the efficacy of a given additive. A quick lab-based test that evaluates the potential of Yea-Sacc in a particular situation can help improve the nutritive value of a given TMR. Building on Alltech IFM, an in vitro rumen fermentation model used to characterize feed digestion kinetics, YSVT is a unique approach to rumen fermentation analysis. Standard in vitro rumen simulation techniques are usually conducted over a shorter period spanning 48 to 72 hours of fermentation. As a result, these techniques do not allow for an accurate evaluation of the efficacy of yeast supplements, as the effects of yeast on rumen populations are not readily evident until supplements like Yea-Sacc have been included in the diet for at least 4 to 7 days. As the animal adapts to the presence of Yea-Sacc in its diet, the rumen microbial population changes to comprise higher concentrations of fiber-digesting and lactate-utilizing bacteria. YSVT utilizes rumen fluid both from animals that have been adapted to Yea-Sacc and their counterparts that are fed the same basal ration without Yea-Sacc. This allows for the adequate adaptation of the rumen microbial populations to Yea-Sacc without the need for long-term incubation in the lab. The YSVT test measures key fermentation indicators, including: Digestibility Lactic acid concentration Useful energy (i.e., energy produced from the fermentation of carbohydrates) Rumen energy efficiency (i.e., useful energy per pound of feed digested) To date, more than 200 dairy TMRs have been analyzed using YSVT. More than 93% of the samples showed a positive response to Yea-Sacc supplementation in terms of useful energy and rumen energy efficiency, with an average response of +13%. In approximately 50% of all samples, the increase in the useful energy released was not correlated with improvements in digestibility. This indicates that Yea-Sacc increases the efficiency by which feed nutrients are converted into useful energy for the animal, most likely through a more efficient and healthier microbiome. The lactic acid response was more variable, with more than 60% of the samples showing decreased concentration, indicating a reduced risk for a lower rumen pH and acidosis. In conclusion, the YSVT helps nutritionists and producers understand the value of yeast in improving rumen fermentation. As a result, feed additive supplementation strategies can be tailored to maximize the energy produced from rumen fermentation and improve digestive efficiency in dairy cows. future developments of this tool will focus on better understanding the interaction of ingredients, the nutrient composition of the TMR and the response to Yea-Sacc — and on developing predictive models to quantify the expected animal performance based on the outcome of a given fermentation profile.

Data from the USDA (2015) shows that in the United States, the average post-weaning pig mortality is 3.6% in the nursery and 4.1% in the grow-finish stage. Combined with an average pre-weaning mortality of 10–15%, it is not uncommon to observe overall mortality rates of 15–20%. That represents a significant inefficiency in our system that must be addressed if our industry wants to become more profitable and more sustainable. The first point that must be addressed is understanding the causes of mortality. As part of the Improving Pig Survivability project, Gebhardt et al. (2020), a team effort from Iowa State University, Kansas State University and Purdue University, conducted a review of the most relevant data and observed that the vast majority of pigs die because of respiratory disease (caused by agents such as PRRS virus, influenza A virus, circovirus and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae), followed by scours/diarrhea (caused by E. coli, PED virus and rotavirus, among others). Figure 1. Percentage of mortality causes adapted from USDA, 2015. Source: Gebhardt et al., 2020. A few strategies have been shown to produce a significant positive impact on pig survivability. Management tools such as biosecurity, pig care, temperature and ventilation control, water availability and quality, cleaning and disinfection, and increasing the weaning age can drastically change mortality and removal rates (Main et al., 2005; Faccin et al., 2020, Gebhardt et al., 2020). Additionally, novel technologies such as feed mitigants (Dee et al., 2021), microbiome modulation and gene-edited pigs are promising tools for the future. However, as nutritionists, we must ask ourselves: Are there any strategies that we can implement through the feed to help alleviate the losses in performance or reduce the number of pigs our customers lose to any given challenge? Crude protein in pig nursery diets Crude protein is probably the most researched and consistent nutritional tool against enteric challenges in pigs. The newly weaned pig — at around 21 days of age — has a relatively limited digestive capacity, as its gastrointestinal tract is adapted to digest milk exclusively. When piglets are fed a high crude protein diet, in addition to all other stressors of the weaning process, there is a good chance that a significant portion of that protein will not be digested in the stomach and small intestine and, as a result, will reach the large intestine, where it can be used as a substrate for bacterial growth. Consequently, that may lead to diarrhea, poorer performance, increased mortality and an increased need for antibiotics. Research shows that feeding a diet with 18% or less crude protein can: reduce the amount of protein fermented in the large intestine and improve fecal consistency (Nyachoti et al., 2006; Htoo et al., 2007) reduce the inflammatory response after an E. coli challenge (Opapeju et al., 2010) reduce the E. coli population in the gastrointestinal tract (Opapeju et al., 2009) It is important to acknowledge that performance can potentially be impacted by feeding low crude protein diets. It is critical to ensure that the pigs’ amino acid requirements are being met. If diets are formulated with synthetic lysine, methionine, threonine, tryptophan, and valine, the next limiting amino acid is likely isoleucine. If synthetic isoleucine is also being used, then histidine likely becomes the limiting amino acid. Research suggests that nursery pigs require around 32% histidine:lysine (Cemin et al., 2018), and a typical nursery diet can easily go below that value. Protein for the synthesis of non-essential amino acids can also be a limiting factor. It is important to use a lysine:crude protein ratio in the formulation software to understand the maximum inclusion rate of synthetic amino acids. Finally, pigs have a remarkable ability to compensate for poorer performance in the nursery during later stages (Menegat et al. 2020). Feeding a low crude protein diet may result in a slower start, but given the appropriate time and diet formulation, in the later stages, pigs will exhibit compensatory growth and can achieve excellent overall performance. Fiber in swine nutrition Carbohydrates can generally be classified as storage or structural carbohydrates. Storage carbohydrates typically refer to starch, which is easily digested by the pig and readily available as an energy source. Fiber, therefore, can be defined as all structural carbohydrates that resist digestion and are fermented in the hindgut (Kerr and Shurson, 2013). Additionally, fibers can be further classified based on several characteristics, such as viscosity and fermentability, but the most common way they are discussed in swine nutrition is based on their solubility in water. Soluble fibers are rapidly fermented by the pig to produce volatile fatty acids: acetate, propionate, and butyrate. These components can be used as energy sources by the enterocytes, resulting in the proliferation of the epithelium. They also have a prebiotic effect by enhancing beneficial bacteria fermentation while reducing the pH to eliminate pathogens. However, soluble fibers do increase digesta viscosity, which, in turn, reduces the passage rate and predisposes colonization by pathogens. Insoluble fibers, on the other hand, are more resistant to fermentation and do not contribute significantly to the production of volatile fatty acids. However, the main benefit of insoluble fibers is that they increase the digesta passage rate, therefore preventing the colonization of pathogens in the gastrointestinal tract (Agyekum and Nyachoti, 2017). Considering the differences between fiber sources, what exactly should be fed to the newly weaned pig? Some research suggests that soluble fibers can increase the incidence of diarrhea in early nursery pigs (Pluske et al., 1998). However, it is important to note that this negative effect is driven by the increased viscosity of the digesta and not because of the fermentability of soluble fibers. Therefore, it appears that insoluble fibers are a better recommendation, particularly for weaned pigs (Molist et al., 2010). However, some reports suggest that a combination of both soluble and insoluble fiber could provide a synergistic effect as long as the soluble source has no impact or only a small impact on viscosity (Wellock et al., 2007; Molist et al., 2014). Soybean meal for health-challenged pigs The effects of soybean meal on PRRS-positive pigs have been previously demonstrated by several researchers (Johnston et al., 2010; Rocha et al., 2013; Rochell et al., 2015). Their studies generally agree that pigs challenged with the PRRS virus have improved performance and/or a reduction in serum viral load when fed high levels of soybean meal. The reasons for the benefits of this ingredient are not fully understood, but one of the hypotheses argues for the presence of bioactive components, such as isoflavones and saponins. These components have several beneficial properties, such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and antiviral properties (Smith and Dilger, 2018). Recently, Smith et al. (2020) observed that PRRS-infected pigs fed high levels of isoflavones had a significant reduction in mortality rates. When considered altogether, the data suggests that soybean meal or components of it have the potential to provide some protection, especially against respiratory challenges. Figure 2. Mortality rate of PRRS-infected weanling pigs fed high levels of isoflavones. NEG = negative control, uninfected pigs. POS = infected pigs. ISF = infected pigs + isoflavones. Source: Smith et al. (2020). Functional amino acids in swine diets It is generally accepted that pig diseases may cause a repartition of nutrients from growth to their more active and demanding immune system. It is also recognized that certain amino acids have important functions in the immune system, and as such, their requirements can increase during a health challenge. This group of amino acids is known as functional amino acids. For instance, threonine is one of the main components of mucin in the gastrointestinal tract (Wang et al., 2010), methionine is a methyl group donor and tryptophan has the ability to impact the inflammatory response and improve the intestinal barrier (Liang et al., 2018). Rodrigues et al. (2021) challenged a group of nursery pigs with Salmonella and provided diets low or high in crude protein and with two different amino acid ratios: 1) control ratios or 2) control ratios with 20% higher threonine, methionine and tryptophan. The authors observed that in a situation where there is no health challenge, pig performance was not affected by increasing functional amino acid ratios. On the other hand, when pigs were challenged with Salmonella, those fed the increased functional amino acids saw a significant improvement in performance regardless of the protein level. Therefore, it appears that health-challenged pigs may benefit from significantly higher ratios of certain amino acids, although more work is required with different pathogens and stages of growth. Figure 3. Performance of pigs fed increased functional amino acid ratios under a Salmonella challenge. Adapted from Rodrigues et al., 2021. On-farm tools As part of the Improving Pig Survivability project, Wensley et al. (2021) conducted a series of trials to identify and quantify the benefits of on-farm tools. The authors evaluated mat feeding, a strategy that consists of spreading a small amount of feed on a mat near the feeders with the objective of stimulating feed intake. Utilizing this strategy for 10 days after weaning resulted in a significant decrease in the mortality and removal rate in the nursery. A second study was conducted to evaluate the effects of creep feeding, which consists of supplementing the piglets’ diet by offering feed while they are still with the sow. The authors found improvements in the overall nursery mortality and removal rates by offering creep feed for four days before weaning, particularly if provided in a large pellet format. These two studies show that simple tools can be effectively used to improve pig mortality, although it is important to consider the extra labor involved in implementing these strategies correctly. Summary Pig mortality is a tremendous challenge for our industry. It is a complex issue that will require a concerted multi-disciplinary effort and that must include swine health, management, nutrition and new technologies to obtain the best possible outcome. As nutritionists, we do have tools available; it is critical that we understand and reevaluate crude protein levels, the utilization of fibers, the potential benefits of soybean meal and the use of higher levels of functional amino acids. Additionally, practical strategies such as mat feeding and creep feeding should be considered. Finally, it is important to consider that each system is unique in its challenges, requiring a complete understanding from the nutritionist to tailor solutions for individual situations.

We spoke with various poultry specialists about antibiotic-free production in poultry, feed additives in poultry nutrition and flock health to help us clarify the facts. Here is what they think about a few of the most frequently asked questions. 1. Is it possible to raise animals completely antibiotic-free? Yes, it is possible to raise animals completely antibiotic-free in the poultry industry. However, when an animal is sick and requires an antibiotic, we must do what is necessary to keep animals, humans and our food system safe. According to Dr. Richard Murphy, research director at the Alltech European Bioscience Centre in Dunboyne, Ireland, while the use of antibiotics in agriculture cannot and should not completely stop due to significant animal welfare implications, this needs to be done judiciously. He says that the industry should look at completely removing antibiotic growth promoters (AGP), and many countries have already introduced policies regarding AGP due to antimicrobial resistance concerns. Dr. Kayla Price, poultry technical manager for Alltech Canada, also agrees that the judicious use and reduction of antibiotics in poultry production is here to stay. “I think it is really important when we are starting to look at general bird health that we make sure we are taking on a holistic approach,” she explained. “Specifically, we really have to think of the intestinal system from hatch to finish.” Price highlights that there is no one silver bullet solution for removing antibiotics; nutrition and biosecurity are both crucial to ensure success. Dr. Dulmelis Sandu, poultry veterinarian for Alltech US, states that as stewards to the animals that we grow for food production, it is necessary to ensure that there are options available to support what is best for the animals at each stage of production — some of which may require antibiotic support or intervention. “It is our responsibility as an industry to provide the right management and best rearing practices to avoid, or at least reduce, the amounts of antibiotics used in animals,” said Sandu. “This is mainly due to the potential implications related to animal welfare, the economic impact related to the expense of antibiotic usage and the overall enhancement of animal health .” There are many approaches to reduce or eliminate the use of antibiotics from poultry production. A preventative approach, such as using a feed additive program, can help reduce the challenges faced when antibiotics are not used and aid long-term flock health and wellness. 2. Does animal consumption of antibiotics affect human resistance? According to the National Academy of Medicine, “antibiotic usage in livestock results in the direct spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to humans.” Specifically, antibiotic resistance can transfer between bacteria, and these bacteria can move between people, animals and the environment. Even though removing antibiotics from animal production will not stop resistance when considering human misuse of antibiotics, our responsibility is to reduce this risk as much as possible. Regardless of the extent to which animal consumption is connected, we need to focus on strategies that minimize the overall risk of resistance. Antibiotic resistance has the potential to become one of the greatest challenges of our generation due to the ever-increasing rise in bacterial strains that are progressively less sensitive to existing treatments. A drawback to the use of antibiotics is their non-specific effects on the gut microbiome. In fact, their use can lead to an overall gut microfloral diversity reduction, allowing for the continued proliferation of resistant species. This can have negative impacts on both flock health and performance. One strategy includes using nutritional supplements such as mannan-rich fractions (MRF) to rehabilitate microfloral diversity. This approach will have significant practical value in commercial production and also beneficially impact consumer health and well-being. 3. Could an animal be treated with antibiotics for illness and still go to market? Yes, even on farms and ranches where they focus on raising animals without antibiotics, if an animal is sick and needs antibiotic treatment, it is separated from the herd and can continue to go through traditional markets. However, a withdrawal period would be required to ensure that no traces of the antibiotic remain in the poultry meat/egg products. In meat production, an animal that has been treated with antibiotics is not put back with the same herd or labeled as raised without antibiotics. In conclusion, antibiotics can assist in maintaining overall animal production, performance and productivity. In countries that banned antibiotics as a growth promoter in production systems, other alternatives must be explored to meet the population’s growing demand for food. Increased biosecurity and enhanced nutrition are two areas that require attention. Nutrition is critical to ensure the animal’s health and productivity. To protect our animals and our food supply, every producer’s operation will need to place a strong emphasis on providing nutrition that strengthens gut health and immunity.

Many owners and trainers in the horse industry consider joint health a top concern for their management programs. This is warranted; after all, the average horse weighs around 1,000 pounds and is supported by four relatively thin legs with very little protection. Understanding equine joints becomes increasingly important for each horse owner, as musculoskeletal injuries are classified as the number-one reason for loss of performance. What’s really going on in the horse’s joints? There are three types of joints in the body, but the type that is most influenced through nutrition (and the type that we typically think of when we think of a joint) is called the synovial joint. Synovial joints are those that allow for movement and help transfer the load between bones, including the elbow, knee or wrist — or, in the horse’s case, the knee, hock or fetlock joint. Synovial joints are composed of: Cartilage, which covers the ends of the two bones that meet at the joint. The joint capsule, which is the space encompassing the entire joint with an inner synovial membrane housing synovial cells and synovial fluid. Ligaments, a type of connective tissue that connects bone to bone. Cartilage is one of the most important aspects of the joint We hate to play favorites, but when it comes to joints, we are partial to cartilage for the role it plays in handling the compressive and concussive forces that joints deal with on a minute-to-minute basis. Cartilage is a metabolically active tissue composed of chondrocytes, the main cells in cartilage, as well as type II collagen and a proteoglycan network. You can think of cartilage as a small, remote town — “Joint Town,” perhaps. In basic terms, the chondrocyte cells produce collagen fibrils, which undergo an extensive cross-linking process during development. Collagen is the road system of “Joint Town.” Proteoglycans are molecules that aid in the shock absorption properties of cartilage. They are made up of a core protein linked to a glycosaminoglycan chain, such as keratin or chondroitin sulfate. Proteoglycans are similar to the houses and buildings that comprise a town. Cartilage is a largely avascular structure, meaning that it receives a limited blood supply, and as a result, repair and renovation is a slow process. This is a small, remote town, after all. While the proteoglycans can be replaced completely after 300 to 1,800 days, the collagen network is considered to be a once-in-a-lifetime building process — in fact, it is estimated to only be replaced every 120 years in dogs and every 350 years in humans! You know how road construction goes. Can you even imagine how long it would take to completely replace a town’s road system? Let’s just say that remodeling a home or building (i.e., the proteoglycans) is enough of a task for the construction workers (i.e., the chondrocytes), who receive limited resources. That being said, it is important to understand that cartilage, being a metabolically active tissue, will vary based on its location within the joint and how much of a load that area experiences. The load in different areas is dependent on the type of exercise that the horse does on a regular basis, as well as on that animal’s unique conformation. Daily “wear and tear” impacts the horse’s joints When a foal is born, it is believed to be born with “blank” joints. The foal’s bone, cartilage and overall joint makeup will develop based on its activity level, and the foal’s early life will set the animal’s joints up for a lifetime of success (or not). This is where balancing the exercise cycle comes into play. Based on this information, we know that exercise is a critical component of equine joint health. On the one hand, exercise builds strength and stimulates blood flow and the “pumping” of synovial fluid in and out of the joint. Synovial fluid not only acts as lubrication in the joint, but it is also an important communication medium between many pieces of the joint, carrying nutrients into the cartilage and waste out. More movement means more nutrients coming in and waste being removed. Think of exercise as traffic control; it helps keep the one-way street in and out of the remote town working, so that resources can continue to be brought in or traded out. On the other hand, too much or chronic, repetitive exercise can strain certain areas of the joint, resulting in “wear and tear” of the cartilage, inflammation, damage and, in the worst-case scenario, osteoarthritis. While some of these effects may be unavoidable, there are certainly preventative measures that can help protect the joints and maximize performance — and nutrition may be one of the least invasive ways to protect horse joints. Which joint supplements for horses actually make a difference? There are many questions about whether joint supplements are useful, and frankly, conducting research that investigates the effects of joint nutraceuticals is challenging, to say the least. While there is always more research to be done, we can honestly say that the evidence does support the fact that joint supplements provide many benefits — especially if you choose the right ones. When shopping for a joint supplement for your horse, consider four key nutrients: 1. Glucosamine Glucosamine is an amino sugar that is a natural component of the horse’s cartilage. Glucosamine is a precursor to building glycosaminoglycans, which, as you know from earlier, are important players in the proteoglycan network. Glucosamine is like “joint food”; it is believed to help prevent cartilage degradation, inflammation and pain in the joint while also supporting cartilage growth. 2. Chondroitin sulfate While glucosamine is a precursor to glycosaminoglycans, chondroitin sulfate is an actual glycosaminoglycan, which bolsters the strength and resistance capabilities of the joint. Research has found that using a combination supplement of glucosamine and chondroitin in horses with osteoarthritis improved flexion tests while decreasing joint volume and lameness scores. 3. Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) Methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) is an organic sulfur compound necessary for the production of connective tissue. Perhaps one of the lesser-understood joint nutrients, research in horses has shown that MSM may help protect the body from free-radical damage due to exercise, and it also appears to play a role in the glutathione pathway, which is an important antioxidant in the body. 4. Hyaluronic acid (HA) Hyaluronic acid (HA) is most well-known for its lubrication and comfort-inducing properties as a major component of synovial fluid. HA is also found in cartilage and helps aid in absorbing shock. Studies have found that HA plays an important role as a protective and anti-inflammatory agent in the joints, decreasing the breakdown of cartilage and synovial fluid. Key points to remember Performance horses are prone to joint disease as a result of their normal activity. While some of this may be inevitable, especially as the joints’ regenerative ability decreases with age, there are various therapies and technologies that can help promote equine joint health. First and foremost, asking your horse to perform a variety of different exercises at various intensity levels and on different surfaces can help keep your horse moving and can help balance the load on the horse’s joints, as well as the inflammation cycle associated with training. Additionally, do not underestimate the power of nutrition. While it is human nature to always seek new information, research offers convincing evidence that high-quality joint supplements can help protect and restore joints throughout a horse’s life. Alltech’s new Lifeforce Joint supplement was designed to provide all four key joint nutrients in one scoop, helping support and maximize your horse’s joint health and long-term performance.

Every facet of the agri-food industry is working hard toward sustainability, and it is especially high on the agendas of all players across the egg supply chain. Noble Foods is the U.K.’s leading vertically integrated company striving to serve the egg industry sustainably, from care and welfare to carbon and waste. Noble Foods entered the world of eggs over 100 years ago, under the name ‘Deans Foods.’ Way back in 1920, William Dean took the rather rustic and entrepreneurial approach of door-to-door egg sales by a horse and cart. Today, Noble Foods is still under the ownership of the third and fourth generation of the Dean family, producing 400 metric tons of egg products every week, 58% of which are free-range. Company facts: Manufactures around 750,000 metric tons of feed every year from five feed mills. Rears around four million pullets per year across 14 rearing sites from 1–16 weeks old. Has 280 laying farm sites, both company-owned and contracted independent farmers. Noble Foods is a leader in vertical integration of the poultry industry in the U.K. Noble Foods has proven and is proud of its forerunning proactiveness, from being the first to trial Salmonella vaccines back in the 1990s to sitting at tier 1 within the BB4 model (a regulated welfare program). Developing a vision and an approach Noble Foods has set some ambitious sustainability goals in recent months, making it the main company driver. Graham Atkinson, Agriculture Director for Producers at Noble Foods, was tasked with making it happen. In Graham’s opinion, sustainability means different things to different people and different businesses. There is no clear right or wrong way of “doing it.” He was not sure how or where to start. However, he had a fair idea of what Noble Foods was trying to achieve and where Alltech could help. So, he asked the question: Could we partner together to make the sustainability challenge an opportunity via the Planet of Plenty partnership program? While Graham and the leadership team accept that the journey will change direction and they will be thrown some curveballs along the way, they have now clearly and proactively defined their vision and focus into four areas: Carbon footprint: reducing the impact of feed regimes. Food loss: restoring and recovering more usable first-class eggs. Land use: reducing and replacing the raw materials. Animal welfare: increasing, developing and driving the fulfillment of the life of laying hens. Now, the hard part: doing it! Putting some meat on those bones. To do this, Graham is busy building a collaborative council of key players to come together and share expertise. A journey joined by others For a while now, Graham has been hunting for partners who share the same vision and who can act as consultants and facilitators. Partners who can deliver the required infrastructure, skill base, science and knowledge to travel fast. Partners who can safeguard their leadership status. Noble Foods has committed to 100% cage-free production by 2025. Alltech, like Noble Foods, is a family-owned and operated business, sharing similar sustainability ambitions and values. These shared common values and ways of working are really what sparked and solidified the partnership — the idea of making a bigger and quicker difference by working together. Through the power of science and nutrition, Alltech is now working very closely with Noble Foods’ supply chain, from start to finish, to help produce more quality eggs from happier birds and with less environmental impact. The Planet of Plenty partnership between Noble Foods and Alltech is still in its infancy. The first pilot project has just begun, and the excitement of the partnership’s impact on future egg production is radiating from within the supply chain. Visit one.alltech.com for more information.

Part 1 of this 3-part series discussed the use of ZnO in piglet feeds, the rationale behind its widespread use and the emerging environmental and health concerns from prolonged ZnO utilization. The key to ensuring that pigs can thrive and survive in a post-zinc oxide era is for EU pig producers to adopt a multi-faceted approach that encompasses optimal nutrition, management, health and welfare practices (see Figure 1). Part 2 of this blog post series will discuss several of these factors, which, when used in combination, should be capable of alleviating PWD in young piglets and lowering ZnO dependency. Figure 1: A holistic approach to achieving optimal pig performance without the use of therapeutic levels of zinc oxide Adopting a holistic approach Unfortunately, there is no ‘silver bullet’ replacement for ZnO. Instead, pig producers across the EU will need to adopt a combination of novel nutritional and management practices to manage PWD in young piglets. Let us take a look at some of these practices: 1. Nutrition Lower protein diets: Reducing the dietary crude protein level for a short period after weaning will reduce the incidence of PWD and improve the intestinal health of piglets by preventing an excess of undigested protein from reaching the large intestine. Advantages of feeding a low crude protein diet include: Decreased proteolytic bacteria populations Decreased pathogenic E. coli Decreased PWD symptoms However, it is critical to ensure that essential amino acid levels and/or ratios are not reduced below the requirement of the pig. High-fiber diets: Fiber in the post-weaning diet plays an important role in controlling the intestinal morphology and microbiota of piglets and improving gut health. Advantages of high dietary fiber feeding include: Decreased PWD symptoms Decreased E. coli shedding Decreased retention time of digesta in the gastrointestinal tract Fibers can also increase the activity of some digestive enzymes, such as lipase. Organic acids: Organic acids have been used successfully in pig production as a useful tool in controlling PWD symptoms and supporting piglet growth, particularly around weaning. The benefit of organic acids comes from their powerful antibacterial, antiviral and antifungal properties. Advantages of dietary organic acid inclusion include: Increased nutrient digestibility Increased growth performance Decreased PWD symptoms Decreased inflammation However, the response to organic acids can depend on several factors, such as organic acid type, inclusion rate, the health status of the pigs and hygiene and welfare standards on the unit. 2. Management Sow and piglet gut health: Getting piglets off to a healthy start in life will help to maximize their lifetime growth performance and minimize antibiotic use. The key to achieving this involves promoting gut health and development as soon as possible after birth. Alltech’s Seed, Feed, Weed (SFW) program supports gut health in sows and piglets by modifying the swine gut microbial population to establish favorable and more diverse microbial populations, reducing E. coli attachment to porcine intestinal cells and optimizing gut structures to ensure optimal nutrient absorption. High-quality colostrum: Unlike infants, piglets are born without maternal antibodies, making them vulnerable to infection. Pig producers need to ensure that newborn piglets have an adequate supply of good quality colostrum because colostrum is rich in immunoglobulins. These immunoglobulins provide piglets with their first line of defense, helping to build their immune system and protecting them until they actively produce their own antibodies. Incorporated into Alltech’s SFW program are feed materials such as Actigen (Alltech), which have been shown to increase colostrum quality and, subsequently, support the gastrointestinal integrity and stability of the piglets that consume it. Creep feeding: Creep feeding is not a new concept by any means, but not all producers think it is worthwhile due to the small amount eaten before weaning (typically 200–250 g/piglet). However, the goal of creep feeding is to: Increase the percentage of eaters in the litter because the pigs that actually eat creep have greater growth rates in the first seven days post-weaning Achieve the recognition effect of solid feed once weaned Support the weaning transition by preparing the piglets gut to digest solid feed Creep feed should be offered from around 4–10 days of age, as the earlier creep feed is offered to piglets, the more significant the proportion of the litter that will be eating creep by weaning. The recommendation is to start by feeding roughly 80 g/day and then increase the amount given as appetite increases. Feeder hygiene is critical when offering creep feed, so keep feeders clean and remove stale and dirty feed daily. Age and weight of pigs at weaning: A significant challenge producers face is getting piglets to have an early intake of solid feed after weaning. To ensure consistently high feed intake post-weaning and, consequently, high lifetime growth, weaning an older and heavier pig should be practiced. Producers are often limited by weaning age, but it is important to note that one extra day at weaning can result in +0.8 kg/pig at the end of the nursery stage and +1.7 kg/pig at slaughter. Weaning an older pig also means weaning a heavier pig, and this will affect mortality and longevity within the herd and reduce the number of days to slaughter, which will reduce the overall cost of production. The SFW program in pre-weaning diets can help producers increase weaning weights by improving the ADG, feed intake and feed efficiency of suckling piglets. Drinking water quality: As water is an essential nutrient, it’s necessary to provide pigs with water of sufficient quantity and adequate quality. Furthermore, restricted water intake can reduce feed intake and ADG by up to 15%. For newly weaned piglets, it is recommended that you: Ensure adequate flow rate (0.5–1 liter/minute) One drinker per 10 piglets Correct location, position and height of drinker in pen is crucial Check/clean drinkers daily Check for salt — salty water reduces intake Test the quality of water for contaminants, microbes and minerals 3. Health Biosecurity in pig farms: Implementing strict biosecurity protocols is one way to manage bacterial infections. This can include ensuring that feed trucks and vehicles are sanitized before entering the farm, that pigs from different groups are never mixed and that producers operate a strict all-in-all-out policy. If strict all-in-all-out policies are implemented, the health status of pigs will improve over time as a result. Vaccination: Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is the most important pathogen responsible for PWD in piglets, and vaccination is shown to be an effective approach to reduce the incidence of ETEC PWD. Following a good vaccination program will reduce the infection pressure and increase the immunity of the herd. Hygiene: Dirty environmental conditions are also a contributing factor to PWD because poor pen and feeder hygiene can affect the health status of piglets. This can be prevented via correct sanitation (i.e., follow strict washing and disinfecting protocols, disinfect rooms with a chlorocresol product, allow rooms to fully dry before new pigs are moved in and ensure that all staff is properly washing their boots). 4. Welfare Social stress and the environment: Pigs are exposed to several different stress factors around the time of weaning (e.g., moving to new nursery accommodation, mixing with unfamiliar pigs, separation from the sow, a change in diet). Because pigs experience a high level of stress so abruptly, it results in intestinal and immune system disorders and, ultimately, piglets suffer with PWD. However, pigs are less prone to disease and intestinal upsets if they are not stressed. It is, therefore, important that producers look at ways of reducing social and environmental stress at weaning by focusing on several aspects, such as feed and water provision, floor and feeder space allowances, the mixing and movement of pigs, temperature and ventilation. As June 2022 draws closer, it is now time for EU pig producers to start making the necessary changes on their units so that they can begin moving towards ZnO-free piglet production. Implementing a holistic strategy that combines optimal nutrition, management, health and welfare practices will be key to ensuring that pigs can thrive and survive in a post-zinc oxide era.

The Chaney family has been embracing innovation and change to ensure the continued success of their operation ever since. Carl’s family is still milking Jersey cows today, nearly 80 years later., However, Carl’s ancestors might be surprised to see some of the changes, including the thousands of people who flock to the farm now to get a tasty treat at Chaney’s Dairy Barn, which first opened in 2003. Despite low milk prices in the early 2000s, Carl and his wife, Debra, saw an opportunity for diversification and took a risk by opening the Dairy Barn, an on-site ice cream shop. That risk has been reaping rewards for nearly 20 years, and Chaney’s Dairy Barn currently goes through 1,200 gallons of ice cream a week. The Chaneys are humbled by the support from the community and the burgeoning interest in what once seemed like a crazy idea — and yet, the popularity of the Dairy Barn is not especially surprising. “Ice cream makes our world go round,” Carl says. Tours give visitors a peek at life on the dairy farm The Chaneys’ farm has more to offer than just ice cream. Visitors can take self-guided tours of the dairy barn, where they can watch and learn about how cows get milked. “They get to see what real agriculture is all about,” says Carl. In 2019, 15,000 people walked through Chaneys’ dairy barn. Carl and his family see this as a critical component to educating the average person about the dairy industry and food production in general, as many people no longer have a direct connection to agriculture. “It is always about education and making the connection,” says Carl. “Connecting with the consumer is what we’re continually trying to do.” The success of the Chaneys’ dairy operation is especially notable when considered in the context of the dairy industry at large. In 2001, Kentucky was home to 2,900 dairy farms — but by February 2022, that number had dwindled to 398. The Chaneys, however, continue to break the mold. In 2016, they installed their first Lely A4 robotic milking system, and they subsequently founded the J.R. Chaney Bottling Co. in 2017. Now, Chaney’s is processing its own milk, which is sold in multiple locations throughout Kentucky. Reaching the next generation of dairy shoppers The Chaneys are especially excited about the availability of their milk because there has been a dramatic change in the way people consume dairy in recent years. While the consumption of some dairy products, like cheese and butter, is currently on the rise, the way people drink milk has transformed. “We are losing ‘long’ milk drinkers because of the change in young children’s habits,” says Elizabeth Lunsford, Carl’s daughter and the fifth generation of her family to work on the dairy farm. “Some of that is based on changes in school milk and quality and the introduction of so many alternative beverages.” Elizabeth and Carl have both seen children who say they don’t like milk light up at the first taste of milk from Chaney’s Dairy. “Cow comfort and milk quality are our specialty,” Carl says. The Chaney family intends to continue introducing quality dairy products to people who visit their farm and, in the process, play a role in building demand for dairy in the next generation of shoppers. Being successful in the dairy business requires resilience, and the Chaney family’s dairy operation is thriving thanks to their willingness to embrace change. They continue to find new ways to connect people with agriculture, whether that’s by hosting movie nights with films projected on the side of the barn or welcoming thousands of students in school groups every year. When it comes down to it, though, the Chaneys contribute their continued success to the stars of the show: their cows, who they value above all else — and it shows. “We truly do have some of the happiest cows in the state of Kentucky,” says Carl.

Inflammation is the basis of any disease that ends in “-itis” — which, unfortunately, accounts for a large percentage of presenting medical conditions. What is inflammation? In and of itself, acute inflammation is not a bad thing. Inflammation is the body’s way of responding to any type of foreign invader or event. The immune system initiates an inflammatory response in order to handle anything and everything, from a wound or infection to bacteria and viruses. There are five cardinal signs of inflammation: Redness Heat Swelling Pain Loss of function All of these signs indicate that the body is working to repair any damaged tissues and remove the potential danger. Inflammation goes wrong when it becomes chronic, meaning that it is a longer-term issue in which the immune system responds inappropriately. In this case, the body is often on a loop of constant low-level inflammation that involves excessive levels of inflammatory cytokines and other proteins that can cause cellular damage at a microscopic level. This chronic inflammation is what puts us and our dogs at a higher risk of developing serious health conditions, ranging from immune diseases in dogs (such as inflammatory bowel disease, hypothyroidism, etc.) to skin and coat issues to heart disease and osteoarthritis. In many cases, chronic inflammation is a common cause of premature aging and a shorter lifespan because of its impact at the cellular level. What causes chronic inflammation? Chronic inflammation in dogs can be caused by environmental toxins or irritants, obesity and, perhaps most notably, an unhealthy diet. While it can be difficult to control or remove every inflammatory agent in today’s world, the good news is that science has made strong links between digestive tract health and inflammation — and nutrition is something that we definitely have the power to change. In both human and animal medicine, the case for using natural, anti-inflammatory ingredients as a means to combat chronic inflammation is growing quickly. In the animal industry, this field of science is often referred to as immunonutrition, or the study of how specific nutrients can impact the immune system. For example, any food that your dog may be allergic or sensitive to can cause inflammation, as can synthetics, toxins and other chemicals. In contrast, some anti-inflammatory ingredients in pet food diets include omega-3 fatty acids, pro- and prebiotics and other functional nutrients, such as antioxidants. What are the signs of chronic inflammation in dogs? A chronic immune response in dogs can manifest as: Low energy and fatigue Unwillingness to walk, play or exercise Weight management issues (i.e., dogs becoming overweight or obese or suddenly losing weight) Itchy, flaky or dry skin, which may lead to infection Pain and discomfort Loss of appetite Vomiting, diarrhea or gastrointestinal (GI) distress The link between the gut microbiome and inflammation A dog’s gut microbiome is immediately affected by its diet, as food acts as the fuel for the living organisms in the digestive tract. As such, our responsibility as pet lovers is to provide our furry companions with nutrients that play a long-term role in their health. In senior pets, especially, inflammation and the buildup of oxidative stress can negatively impact the aging process and can even lead to premature aging. The ability to prevent premature aging — or “inflammaging,” as it has been coined — through the diet is key to canine longevity. For dogs, science has learned that the smallest ingredients, or micronutrients, often make the biggest difference. One example of the micronutrients that are gaining attention from both scientists and consumers is pro- and prebiotics for senior pets. A 2019 study in senior beagles looked at the microbiome-related effects of a control diet versus a diet that included NVGEN, a proprietary blend from Alltech that includes prebiotics and other gut health promoters. The dogs that were fed NVGEN showed higher levels of the bacteria that are associated with a healthy digestive tract, while the dogs fed a control diet had higher levels of the bacteria associated with inflammatory conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis. Additionally, the dogs that were fed the diet that included NVGEN displayed significantly lower levels of C-reactive protein, a standard measurement of inflammation in the body. Feeding a diet that contained NVGEN resulted in a decrease of the amount of C-reactive protein to a normal level — which is a big deal for promoting healthy aging in dogs! The anti-inflammatory pet plan Inflammation is one of the most insidious symptoms of many chronic health conditions in pets. Inflammation can begin to manifest in pets in their younger years and can negatively affect the aging process as they become seniors. An anti-inflammatory lifestyle is important for dogs at every life stage and includes: Managing the dog’s weight Feeding an age-appropriate, high-quality diet Regular exercise and activity Proper levels of mental stimulation (without creating excessive stress) Protecting and supporting the microbiome The bottom line is that promoting a healthy inflammatory response and immune system in pets starts in the gut. Protecting the GI tract with ingredients such as the Alltech NVGEN pack is a critical step in improving pet food diets and, as a result, boosting the longevity of our beloved dogs.

It is a hot topic around the globe right now, and beef industry sustainability is at the center of the conversation. As Dr. Jude Capper puts it, “all of us within the industry, regardless of what our role is, have to think about and have to be talking about [sustainability] going forward, because it really isn’t an issue that is ever going away.” Capper, who has been working in the sustainability space for about 15 years, shared some thought-provoking insights into what should be considered going forward in the world of sustainability during the Alltech ONE Conference (ONE). Let’s discuss four key points Capper made in her presentation. 1. We need to define “sustainability” “There are honestly as many definitions of this word as there are people in the universe, almost,” Capper stated. “But from a scientific point of view, and particularly when we’re talking about food and farming systems, it’s generally considered to be a balance between three things. And those are environmental responsibility, economic viability and social acceptability. And all of those things, in the long term, have to balance.” Right now, however, the global focuses are clear: greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and net zero. This is demonstrated by companies worldwide regularly announcing some degree of net-zero-type commitment. However, what this has led to, according to Capper, are graphs and metrics being produced that attempt to measure sustainability but that neglect to accurately represent the global beef industry and its various systems around the world. “We see a huge variation,” Capper said. “We can’t make global averages, or global commitments or globally say we’re going to implement practice ‘x,’ whatever that might be because there’s so much variation in the system.” To further this point, she cited some data from Gerber et al. in 2013, showing a global lifecycle assessment of beef systems. The bar chart is partitioned out by region and represents greenhouse gas emissions/carbon footprint in terms of carbon per kilo of deadweight. True representation is difficult here — when you look at the world average compared to each region, it supports the opinion that we cannot expect the same systems and practices to work globally. “We can have very clear goals, but the way that we achieve those goals is always going to vary according to the system, the region, the market, the culture and the opportunities we have there,” Capper explained. “We should always see, if we do it in a carefully considered, well-thought-out way, the positive correlation between improving efficiency, having lower carbon footprint, lower resource use and at a lower cost as well. So, there’s a positive correlation between the economics and the environment. “But the thing that we always have to bear in mind is that just because it’s environmentally beneficial or at a lower economic cost doesn’t always mean that it’s socially acceptable.” 2. Beef producers are utilizing sustainable practices Capper went on to lay out ways to improve the productivity of our systems and stated that most producers are already actively pursuing these goals. However, she reiterated that there is no “one size fits all” system. When it comes to system efficiency, Capper touched on a few data points to put it into perspective. In her calculations, one cow in a cow-calf system needs just under 4,000 kilograms of feed, takes in just over 20,000 liters of water, and emits almost 2,500 kilos of carbon dioxide every single year. With this in mind, it could be easy to promote cutting cattle numbers and assume the world would benefit. But, as Capper states, we must consider all of the positives that we get in terms of biodiversity, landscape maintenance, soil quality and using land where we simply cannot grow anything else to produce high-quality, nutritious food. The opportunity for showing the benefit cattle have on the environment is hard to quantify right now, but it is there. And even so, there are still ways beef producers can improve sustainability (converting crop land to grazing land, focusing on genetics, etc.). 3. Cattle can contribute to global cooling Capper shared some data from Oxford University that clarifies some of the differences between methane and other greenhouse gases. “In the past, we assumed that, as with carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide, any methane that we emitted into the atmosphere just builds up and builds up and builds up over time,” Capper explained. “So that was under a metric called ‘Global Warming Potential,’ or GWP 100.” GWP 100 got us one step closer to standardizing the effects of greenhouse gases. However, it did not consider the differences between methane (a short-lived climate pollutant) and carbon dioxide (a long-lived climate pollutant). GWP*, the new metric, is seen as an improved way to measure the effect individual greenhouse gases have on global warming. This is important as methane emissions from beef production are recycled as part of the biogenic carbon cycle. To keep it simple: the biogenic carbon cycle is when plants take in and store carbon dioxide that is consumed by cattle and released as methane. Then, after a dozen years or so, that methane is converted back into carbon dioxide, and the cycle continues. Because plants need carbon dioxide and cattle can consume plants like grasses, cattle are vital to this cycle. And it is even possible that cattle can contribute to global cooling through this. “Methane can only contribute to global cooling if methane emissions actually decline over time,” Capper stated. “And it only has to decline by a tiny bit, but they have to keep coming down rather than getting more and more and more every year (…) So that means that if we do things to improve productivity, fertility, pasture management, all of those things that I talked about earlier, such that we can make the same amount of beef, for example, with [let’s say 1% fewer cattle], then we could have a really positive effect in terms of global cooling.” Even with this approach, it is important to account for beef cattle's vital role in balancing our ecosystem and utilizing otherwise unproductive lands. 4. We need a standard carbon footprinting tool A challenge the industry faces is creating a standard carbon footprinting tool. Ideally, one that can transcend across global regions and various production systems. There are tools out there, but we need one that is standardized and more all-encompassing.

By 2050, it will be home to a quarter of the world’s population. With a land mass more than 3 times larger than that of China, it contains roughly 60 percent of the world’s uncultivated arable land! Rich resource potential coupled with an emerging consumer class. Dr. Damien McLoughlin, Dean of the Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School, University College Dublin, encouraged participants at Alltech’s 30th Annual International Symposium to seriously consider business development opportunities in Africa, and he shared important lessons for success: Pathfinder firms are already conducting business in Africa. Dr. McLouglin shared the success stories of the VP Group in Kenya, Zambeef in Zambia, the agricultural giant Olam, and the world’s largest premium spirits company, Diageo. He emphasized the importance of building your knowledgebase before investing, managing the problem of too much opportunity, and of thinking first about routes to markets in a land with little or no retail infrastructure. He underscored the importance of tailoring innovation to meet the needs and desires of the African consumer, who are known to already like many western brands. Lastly he described what he called a “war for talent” and discussed the importance of developing local talent to build management teams and the necessity for stakeholder engagement. Consider Zambeef Products PLC. Incorporated in 1994, Zambeef and its subsidiaries now represent one of the largest, integrated agribusinesses in Zambia and as such are involved in the production, processing, distribution, and retailing of beef, chicken, pork, milk, dairy products, eggs, edible oils, stock feed, flour and bread. Zambeef’s core strategy has been to offer consumers the most accessible and affordable quality protein by expanding retail and wholesale distribution to increase regional market penetration. Zambeef has achieved its success by pursuing a vertically integrated business model that provides a strong foundation of growth through margin capture, securing supply chains, and reducing risk and earning volatility. According to Dr. McLoughlin, “It is not too late for new investors to get involved in Africa.” He contends that the private sector has the power, in cooperation with nongovernmental organization, government agencies, and universities, to tackle tough developmental challenges now.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/africa-unparalleled-agribusiness-opportunities","title":"\n\n                    Africa: Unparalleled Agribusiness Opportunities\n                    ","date":"August 19, 2014","contentLength":372}},{"pageContent":"With the changing global climate, many people are becoming more aware of how they impact the environment on a day-to-day basis. And the same goes for horse owners, as more and more equestrians explore sustainable horse farm management practices. While achieving sustainability in the equine industry may seem daunting, the good news is that there are many avenues for us to explore, and each one makes a difference! If your horse is boarded at a facility, you may not have control over some common environmental pitfalls, such as manure management or preventing overgrazing of horse pastures. However, almost every horse owner has some say in their horses’ nutrition, and luckily, with a few easy changes, your horses’ diet can become more environmentally friendly. Trace mineral supplementation in horse feeds Since they only make up around 2% of a horse’s diet, minerals are often underestimated — but they are actually responsible for hundreds of thousands of functions within the horse’s body, from the development of joint cartilage to maintaining healthy hair and hoof quality. In the equine digestive system, the bulk of the vitamins and minerals included in the diet are absorbed in the small intestine and taken into the bloodstream to be distributed throughout the body for use. Macrominerals or major minerals, such as calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, sodium, potassium, chloride and sulfur are required in larger amounts than the microminerals or trace minerals, which include copper, zinc, manganese, iron, selenium, cobalt and more. But while the requirements for trace minerals might be smaller, they are majorly important for horse health. While hay and pasture grass contain vitamins and minerals in varying levels, depending on the soil quality, processing, region, etc., horses often require additional supplementation for optimal health, which is why grains and other supplements are generally formulated with minerals. Providing adequate amounts of minerals — but not too much — is best for the environment Interestingly enough, horses are unable to store large amounts of excess minerals in their bodies, and research has shown that exceeding 100% of their mineral requirements results in higher mineral excretion (i.e., mineral-rich manure), which has important environmental implications. In her presentation at the Alltech ONE Ideas Conference in June, Dr. Mieke Holder explained what happens when excess minerals are fed to horses. In a brief nutshell: Horses produce about 50 pounds of manure per day. That manure sits outside in pastures or is picked out of stalls but is then left to compost outside. When fecal material gets wet from any type of precipitation, the minerals that have been excreted begin to solubilize. Excess minerals can run off and join surface water or move through soil layers (which is known as “mineral leaching”) and end up joining the underground water supply. The other piece of the mineral puzzle lies in fecal microbial organisms. Recent research from Dr. Holder’s lab has shown that the bacteria in the feces accumulate some of the minerals that are excreted. Providing minerals in a form that encourages accretion, or “feeding,” by fecal bacteria should continue to be explored, as that appears to decrease the amount of minerals leaching into soil and water. To bring it all together, Dr. Holder’s research has shown that providing increased levels of trace minerals in horses’ diets also increases the levels of phosphorus that leach from those diets. Given that phosphorus is an element of great environmental concern, it is crucial that minerals are not only fed at the appropriate levels but in bioavailable forms as well. Organic minerals for horses Dr. Holder defines organic minerals as minerals that are bound to a ligand carrier, such as a protein or amino acid chelating agent. Several examples of organic trace minerals are those offered by Alltech as Bioplex® (copper, zinc, manganese, cobalt and iron) and Sel-Plex® (organic selenium). In contrast, inorganic minerals are complexed with a compound, such as a carbonate, chloride, sulfate or oxide. While research over the years has shown varied results in terms of the differences between organic and inorganic minerals in horses’ diets, several compelling studies have shown that organic minerals are absorbed at higher levels and are more readily usable by the horse’s body than their inorganic counterparts. When organic minerals are absorbed at higher levels, that also means that fewer minerals are excreted, which can help protect the environment. For example, glutathione peroxidase, a selenium-dependent antioxidant enzyme, showed increased activity after exercise in horses fed Sel-Plex® versus horses who received inorganic selenium (in the form of sodium selenite). Other recent research has shown that supplementation with organic trace minerals can help improve joint cartilage indicators and antioxidant activity in growing horses. Given that we want our horses to be around for many more years than the typical production animal, the fact that there is evidence indicating that organic trace mineral supplementation can help maintain horses’ health, development and performance is notable. Minerals as an equine management tool Thanks to Dr. Holder’s presentation, we know for sure that: Horses have mineral requirements that are often unmet by forage alone. Trace minerals, despite only being required in small amounts, have great value in preventing health problems. Feeding excess minerals to horses is not only financially wasteful but also has a negative impact on the environment. Prioritizing high-quality mineral nutrition for our animals may not be the most common or well-known route for minimizing our environmental impact, but it could make a huge difference. As a horse owner, you can read your horses’ feed and supplements labels to learn whether the trace minerals included are offered in an organic form, which can be identified by names that often include the words “proteinate,” “chelate,” “amino acid complex” or “methionine.” Seek to feed the best-quality nutrition, not only for your horses’ health and performance but to help mitigate any environmental hazards as well. To learn more about the benefits of equine trace mineral nutrition, watch Dr. Holder’s entire presentation at the 2021 Alltech ONE Ideas Conference.

Nutrition is something that pet owners have the ability to influence every single day, so while we may be biased, we believe that nutrition is one of the most important ways to care for pets through every stage of life. Some of the most important elements — literally! — of premium nutrition are trace minerals. What are trace minerals? Trace minerals are elements, such as zinc, copper, iron and manganese, that are required in very small amounts in a balanced diet but that have a wide range of health benefits, including supporting your cat’s or dog’s immune system, musculoskeletal health and skin and coat condition, to name a few. In pet food diets, there are two important considerations when it comes to trace minerals: The form of the mineral offered (inorganic vs. organic) The amount of trace mineral provided (to ensure that there are no nutritional deficiencies) Both of these factors will significantly influence the mineral’s bioavailability, or the impact that a particular trace mineral has on your pet. Trace minerals for cats and dogs are not created equal The nutrition marketplace has many different options when it comes to supplying trace mineral supplements for pets. These can be broadly classed as either inorganic (ITM) or organic trace minerals (OTM). The latter are so-called because the trace minerals are complexed — that is, they are associated with organic bonding groups. These bonding groups include amino acids, small peptides and organic acids, all of which influence the strength of the mineral binding. Many factors need to be considered when trying to compare OTM products, but ultimately, the strength of the interaction between the mineral and the bonding group is the most important factor influencing bioavailability. Enhanced OTM bonding can ultimately increase the mineral’s bioavailability and effectiveness in the animal’s body. The choice of bonding group is, therefore, critical to the effectiveness of OTMs, and research over the last number of years has highlighted the differences that exist between individual products. A poor choice of bonding group can result in the creation of products that offer no benefit over inorganic sources of minerals. Inorganic trace minerals come from mined sources. Safety and traceability must be part of the quality assurance process to avoid the inclusion of heavy metals that, if present in a diet, can be deleterious to the long-term health of dogs and cats, especially as their lifespans increase. In essence, not all trace minerals are created equal, but not all OTM products are created equal either. How does the mineral form affect the nutrients that pets receive in their diets? Keeping the nutritional balance of minerals in pet food can become rather complicated, because inorganic sources of trace minerals have variable absorption rates, and their bioavailability may be influenced by factors such as other dietary nutrients and the physiological condition of the animal, to name a few. To counteract their poor bioavailability, it is common practice to add higher-than-recommended levels of inorganic trace minerals to commercial foods. Bioplex® organic minerals, an alternative to the use of inorganic mined mineral sources, provide a number of benefits, from improved bioavailability to the support of the proper metabolic and physiological processes, which may not be carried out at full capacity when the trace mineral elements are not adequately supplied. The amount of the mineral provided in diets will differ based on its form As noted above, inorganic sources of trace minerals have variable absorption rates due to their structure. The absorption rate is a measurement of how the minerals are “taken up” by the digestive system and recruited into areas of need, such as the immune response and tissue repair. When inorganic trace minerals are included in pet food diets, the amount that a pet consumes does not reflect the amount of trace minerals they actually absorb. After a pet eats, the food is broken down by their digestive system to make nutrients available for absorption and use. The structure of the inorganic mineral causes it to interact with other components during this process. This results in the inorganic mineral forming an indigestible complex that ultimately ends up on the lawn or in the litterbox. We describe this as poor bioavailability because, even though you are providing your pet with trace minerals in their food, those minerals are not able to be properly put to use and benefit your pet. To counteract this problem, it is common to add higher-than-recommended levels of trace minerals — but doing so is simply disguising one issue with another. There are three ways that mineral form can influence nutrient absorption in the gut: 1. Food and feed antagonisms Increasingly, the interactions between food components and trace minerals have come under scrutiny, with the possibility for negative interactions and antagonisms. Credit: https://orthomolecular.webs.com/Elements/MineralWheel1.jpg 2. Impact on vitamin stability The oxidation of vitamins, such as vitamin E, can lead to reduced vitamin function and can be caused by the oxidation of fats and, often, the actions of trace minerals. The type and, particularly, the form of the trace mineral will influence its effect on vitamin stability. Studies examining vitamin E stability in the presence of inorganic or organic minerals demonstrate that, in the inorganic form, minerals can be detrimental to the stability of the vitamin molecule. Depending on the OTM source, however, the use of chelated minerals for dogs and cats may not cause such a dramatic decrease. 3. Compromised antioxidant function Additional research assessing the effect of minerals on food components has established that commonly used antioxidants can be compromised by inorganic minerals. The data further indicates that, in cases where OTMs have shown weak mineral bonding, there is a significant negative impact on antioxidant activity. The choice of OTMs, therefore, plays a role in ensuring the quality and stability of food components. Bioplex® organic trace minerals for pets are superior Organic trace minerals are made differently. Organic minerals have a ring structure, which gives them protection and allows them to successfully pass through the digestive system. From there, the minerals can go through the gut wall and into the bloodstream to do their work. This is where inorganic trace minerals get left behind, as they stick to the gut instead of passing through it. Think of the gut as a gate; it either allows nutrients through or it doesn’t. Inorganic forms of trace minerals are still used in pet food, but we are beginning to see more pet food manufacturers moving to better mineral nutrition, such as Bioplex® organic trace minerals. Organic trace minerals make for healthy pets While only required in small amounts in the diet, organic trace minerals play a large role in the body, and mineral deficiencies can be detrimental to an animal’s health. For example, zinc is directly utilized for the hair and skin, favoring processes of cellular integrity. A zinc deficiency may manifest as a dysfunction of the epithelial tissue, dermatological conditions, coat problems and gastrointestinal tract injuries (due to damage to the microvilli). Copper and manganese are directly deposited in the bones, joints, liver and muscle, and they are greatly important for the formation and homeostasis of the bone structure, making these especially important minerals for puppies and kittens. Copper is a cofactor of the enzyme lysyl oxidase, which is necessary for the cross-linking of collagen and elastin during cartilage synthesis. Manganese is a cofactor of glycosyltransferases, enzymes that are important in the formation and elongation of the glycosaminoglycan chain, which forms the basal substance of the cartilage model. We could go on and on, but when it comes to mineral choice in pet food diets, organic trace minerals are far less likely to negatively affect other essential nutrients than inorganic sources. However, not all forms of organic minerals react in the same way. Therefore, we encourage diet formulators to pay greater attention to their choice of ingredients to maximize not only nutrition but the quality and stability of pet food. Optimizing trace mineral nutrition will create healthier pets with more robust immune, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal systems. Not only will your pet food be a superior option on the shelves, but pet parents will see the difference and will surely continue buying your products.

Selenium is an essential trace element that plays an important role in preventing selenium-dependent diseases that impact thyroid, cardiovascular and fertility functions. But did you know that selenium also plays a positive role in agriculture? In addition to its antioxidant benefits in humans and animals, selenium has also been found to decrease the negative effects of soil pH on plant growth, to support plants’ tolerance to environmental stressors and even, potentially, to increase plant protection. When selenium is not available in the soil and the area surrounding the root system, it can be added to nitrogen-rich fertilizers, allowing the plant to convert the selenium into more bioavailable forms that can be easily consumed by humans and animals, bringing selenium and its benefits full-circle. What is selenium? Discovered in 1817, this trace element takes its name from selene, the Greek word for “moon,” because of its similarities to tellurium, which was named after the Greek word for “earth”. It also is similar in nature to sulfur and features uptake pathways comparable to the pathways found in that element. Selenium, unfortunately, is an element with a sordid reputation. Much like the bear family in Goldilocks, the amount of selenium included in the diet must be “just right” for optimal health. Too much results in death; too little ends in disease and deficiency. The availability of selenium in the soil is dependent on the pH levels and the amount of organic matter in that soil. Other factors include the microbial activity, moisture and texture of the soil, as well as its temperature. There are three forms of selenium that are most commonly found in soils: Selenite: Found in more aerobic soils with a neutral pH Selenate: Useful in soils with a lower pH and lower oxidation reduction potential; it is taken up more readily and transported from the roots to other parts of the plant Selenide: More dominant in soils with very diminished conditions Selenium is also found in three amino acids (called seleno-amino acids) that have also proven to be toxic in large doses but that are beneficial in smaller amounts. Studies have shown that seleno-amino acids — especially selenomethionine (SeMet) — have antimicrobial properties that improve plant health and can decrease the potential for mycotoxin production. How does selenium improve plant production? In adequate amounts, selenium has been found to have several positive effects on plants, including: An increased tolerance to environmental stressors, such as drought and salinity stress. A decrease in the uptake of toxic metals, as well as in the dangerous effects of those metals on plants. Improved plant development. Potentially increased yield. Improved fruit or grain quality Improved availability of selenium in fruit and grain for animal and human consumption. How do I know if I have enough selenium in my soil? Soil testing is the most efficient way of determining the amount of selenium in your soil. Additionally, testing will not only tell you if you have too much or too little selenium, but it will also note the pH levels in your soil, allowing you to learn which types of selenium are more prevalent there. What if my soil is selenium-depleted? Selenium biofortification is the addition of selenium through liquid fertilizers or through a slower-release option, which are applied directly to the soil or sprayed on the leaves at strategic times in order to increase the amount available to the plants. Dr. Luiz Guilherme of the University of Lavras in Brazil explored the effects of selenium biofortification during the crop track of the annual Alltech ONE Ideas Conference. In his presentation, Dr. Guilherme discussed the challenges of producing food with a high nutrient density. “With adequate nutrient management, we contribute a lot to global food security,” he said, noting that when dealing with selenium-deficient soils, it is rare to produce plants for human consumption that have enough selenium to meet our requirements without the addition of a supplement. The proper stewardship and management of both the soil and crops are key to achieving our cropping system goals, improving nutrient uptake and minimizing nutrient and environmental loss. In his presentation, Dr. Guilherme related the importance of nutrient management through “The 4 Rs of Nutrient Stewardship”: Right source: The fertilizer/additive types must match the crop’s needs. Right rate: Adding the specific amounts for the crop’s needs. Right time: Providing the nutrients needed by the crops when they need them and can best use them. Right place: Placing the nutrients where the crop can best utilize them (e.g., applying fertilizer to the soil, where it is taken up by the roots or sprayed directly onto the plants). By following these steps, growers are seeing increased levels of bioavailable selenium in their crops. For example, in some instances, applying selenium-fortified fertilizers to wheat during the vegetative and grain filling stage (instead of during planting or the initial take-off stages) has resulted in greater yields and has increased the amount of selenium in the grain, thereby adding to the daily selenium intake of humans and animals. According to Norman Borlaug, the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, “Food is the moral right of all who are born in this world” — but the word “nutritious” should be added to the beginning of that statement, Dr. Guilherme argued in his address. The many agricultural uses and health benefits of selenium are still being discovered, and promising results are being reported. As Dr. Guilherme noted, some exciting research is being done exploring the different selenium complexes and their applications for various crops, as well as what this means in the entire food chain.

We are sure that you have read the purpose statement on the feed tag identifying the grain that will best suit your horse’s stage of life. You have likely even studied the guaranteed analysis to determine the feed’s crude protein, crude fat and crude fiber levels. However, while this is a great start, there is a bigger story to be told from each bag’s feed tag — one that is more interesting than you may realize. Understanding what the guaranteed analysis tells you The guaranteed analysis is an excellent place to start when reading the feed tag because this table is all about what a feed company can guarantee is in their horse feed. This is important for maintaining consistency. If you think about all the different ingredients in a bag of horse feed, including forage and grain products, the reason why these guarantees are important becomes more obvious. Ingredient prices and fluctuations due to the weather, the season and other variables can easily change the composition of a bag of feed. Since rapid diet changes are not ideal for equine gut health, feed companies guarantee that certain nutrient levels (typically in a range, with a minimum and a maximum level) will be included in each bag. The guaranteed analysis also guarantees that the nutrient levels meet the requirements established by the National Research Council and the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO). For horses, guaranteed analysis requirements include: Crude protein Crude fiber Crude fat Acid detergent fiber Neutral detergent fiber Calcium Phosphorus Copper Zinc Selenium Vitamin A The guaranteed analysis on many horse feeds will also include lysine, which is the number-one limiting amino acid for horses. Sugar and dietary starch levels are also required to be guaranteed if a horse feed is marketed with any carbohydrate claims. While each feed’s guaranteed analysis will differ, many share similar ranges of nutrients to meet a horse’s particular stage of life. So, if many guaranteed analyses look similar, how does anyone manage to choose the best horse feed? As it turns out, there is quite a bit of information that cannot be found on the tag’s guaranteed analysis alone. Read the complete ingredient list The second piece to this puzzle involves reading the entire ingredient list on the feed tag. While this sounds boring — and sometimes daunting! — it can actually be quite eye-opening. Here are a few things to look for: Organic vs. inorganic trace minerals Organic vs. inorganic selenium Any bonus ingredients, such as added probiotics for horses Decoding minerals Minerals are the backbone (literally!) of the horse’s body, making up every organ, tissue and cell. They play a role in every single body system, from skeletal and muscular development to nervous system function and hair and hoof health. While only present in very small quantities in a bag of feed, they are crucially important for your horse’s overall performance. Trace minerals make up a very tiny percentage of a horse’s daily intake, which is why their bioavailability is so important. Bioavailability has to do with the rate in which they are absorbed AND utilized in the body. Organic trace minerals (e.g., zinc, copper, cobalt, manganese) are both absorbed at higher levels and are more readily utilized by the horse because they are presented in a form that mimics the form in which minerals are found in nature. On the feed tag, organic minerals will be listed as the mineral name, followed by the word “proteinate,” “methionine” or “amino acid complex.” You can easily spot inorganic minerals because they will be listed as the mineral name followed by the word “oxide” or “sulfate.” For instance, the ingredient “zinc oxide” is an inorganic version, which is both cheaper and less conducive for optimal horse health and performance. Read the feed tag to check the feed’s trace mineral status. Ideally, choose a feed that contains 100% organic zinc, copper, cobalt and manganese. The selenium connection Selenium is also considered a trace mineral, and in horses, it is especially noteworthy because too much — or too little — can be detrimental and even fatal. Selenium is a highly important mineral in the antioxidant pathway, which is why it is crucial for recovery, endurance and metabolism. Inorganic selenium is easy to spot on feed tags and will be listed as “sodium selenite.” Organic selenium, on the other hand, will be listed as “selenium yeast.” Be careful: Some feeds use a mix of both types of selenium. Choose feeds that contain only 100% selenium yeast for best results. Ingredients to support gut health for horses Your final task in reading the ingredient list on the horse feed tag is to check for any bonuses. Yes, organic minerals should be non-negotiable, but it is possible for your horse to get even more out of its feed! Think of this like the prize at the bottom of the Cracker Jack box. One example is added probiotics for horses. However, be careful how you interpret these, because not all probiotic supplements, or good gut bacteria, are created equal. You can always call the feed company to clarify how they source and add probiotics into their feeds to ensure their viability and efficacy. Look on the feed tag for ingredients such as “yeast culture,” “hydrolyzed yeast,” “dried brewer’s yeast” or any specific strain of probiotic bacteria. These ingredients can increase your horse’s ability to fully digest and utilize the feed — thanks to beneficial bacteria — while also potentially saving you from having to purchase additional equine supplements. A final word While there is a lot more information that you can glean from a horse feed tag, start by looking for these three pieces of information: trace minerals (zinc, copper, cobalt, manganese), selenium and any added ingredients that support gut health in horses. The guaranteed analysis is a good start, but it does not tell you anything about the quality or forms in which these very important nutrients are included. Start reading the feed tag ingredient list, and do not hesitate to call the feed company to ask more specific questions. Nutrition is the basis of every animal’s quality of life.

Can you actually train your brain to handle life’s greatest challenges without stress and negative emotions? According to Shirzad Chamine, neuroscientist and CEO of Positive Intelligence, Inc., you can do both — and when you do, you will be happier and more successful and will perform better. This may sound aspirational, but Chamine has the research — and methodology — to prove that mental fitness is the key to unleashing your true potential at work and in life. More than 500,000 people from over 50 countries have participated in Chamine’s Positive Intelligence research. Having coached hundreds of CEOs and their executive teams, as well as world-class athletes and students from Stanford University, he’s helped professionals worldwide make mental fitness a part of their daily routine. What is mental fitness? Mental fitness is our capacity to respond to life’s challenges with a positive mindset, rather than a negative one. It’s measured by your Positive Intelligence Quotient, or PQ, which is the percentage of time your mind spends serving you as opposed to sabotaging you. As a conscious method for avoiding self-sabotage, your PQ can be built and strengthened over time. Independent researchers have validated the many benefits of a higher PQ, ranging from higher salaries to greater success in work, marriage, friendship and more. Additionally, project teams with a high PQ are shown to perform 31% better on key performance metrics. Chamine’s approach to boosting PQ, which he recently discussed during his keynote address at the 2021 Alltech ONE Ideas Conference, begins with learning the behavioral neuroscience behind two very different components of the mind: the Saboteurs and the Sage. This might sound complex, but understanding the roles that Saboteurs and the Sage play in the way we experience life is one of the simplest, most effective ways for overcoming long-term patterns of self-sabotage. Identifying your Saboteurs Saboteurs are the negative voices and limiting beliefs and habits that stand between you and the potential you actually fulfill. Saboteurs motivate you through negative emotions like fear, stress, anger, guilt, shame and insecurity. There are 10 Saboteurs responsible for the most common ways that we self-sabotage. The most common is The Judge, or the voice that tells us to find fault in ourselves, in others, and in our situations and circumstances. It’s constantly judging what’s wrong and fails to see what’s right. Imagine Saboteurs as a cast of characters in your mind that keep you in a place of negativity, reaction and self-doubt. Finding your Sage By contrast, the Sage is the Saboteurs’ positive counterpart that motivates us through emotions like curiosity, empathy, creativity and calm. Whereas the Saboteur fuels self-sabotage, the Sage brain tells us that every outcome or circumstance can be turned into a gift or an opportunity. The strength of your Sage is what determines your PQ and enables you to take clear-headed, laser-focused action. Understanding the differences between your Sage and your Saboteurs — and identifying which one your mind is serving — is the first concrete step to self-mastery. “You're not just of two minds; you are of two brains. You have two entirely different wirings in your brain, with different neurochemicals that get produced and very different functioning,” said Chamine. “A big question at any given time is: Which part of your brain is activated right now? That determines everything about how you handle life's great challenges.” By understanding which part of your brain is activated and the power of Positive Intelligence to determine your response, you can train yourself to recover and switch from negative to positive at a faster pace. How to strengthen your PQ 1. Intercept your Saboteurs When you feel a negative emotion, stop to observe and label your Saboteurs. By simply bringing them into awareness, you’ve already weakened their power. 2. Power up your Sage brain Now that you’ve confronted your Saboteurs, it’s time to shift into Sage mode. Practice PQ reps to activate your Sage mind. PQ reps are simple exercises that involve shifting your attention to your body and your senses for at least 10 seconds. These practices strengthen the self-command muscle that helps you regulate your emotions. You can do PQ reps anytime, anywhere. 3. Choose Sage responses Now, you can explore, empathize, innovate, navigate and activate to respond with the Sage perspective. “When your Sage comes in and says, ‘You know what? I can and I shall convert this into a gift and opportunity,’ imagine what emotions you’re going to be experiencing,” Chamine suggested. “You're going to be feeling optimistic. You're going to be feeling curious. “When you ask ‘How do I turn this into a gift? What could the gift be?’, you're activating a positive region of your brain that's wired for creativity, for resourcefulness,” he continued. “You're creating a positive foundation — not just in your own head, but amongst others.” With this knowledge, Chamine wondered: What if you focused on building the powers of your mind with the same determination you bring to our improving your physical fitness? Can you imagine the possibilities? “Moment by moment, one day at a time, that muscle of positivity builds,” Chamine reminded viewers at ONE. “And then, the contagion effect that you create in the world — you have no idea how powerful that is. You create a contagion, (but) rather than a contagion of negativity, you intercept that, and you create a positive contagion.

This phrase has adorned coats of arms and emblems for families, teams and societies throughout world history, advocating the virtues of bravery and the prosperous rewards that can come from it. While this proverb may not be the official motto of Andrea Stroeve-Sawa and her family business, Shipwheel Cattle Feeders Ltd., the story behind this agricultural enterprise — from its humble yet extraordinary beginnings to its current innovative successes — embodies the same message. “My Great-Grandpa (Albert) Green started farming in 1893, and he was 17 years old,” Andrea said, explaining the origins of her family’s business in Taber, Alberta, Canada, about two hours from the U.S. border. “The eldest of three sons, he grew up in a time in Sweden of massive drought, poverty and famine, and the story goes that, one night, he overheard his parents talking about the famine and poverty and how they were going to have to send somebody out to work, because they couldn't afford to feed all the mouths that they had to feed. “So, in the middle of the night, Albert just took it upon himself to go down to the boat docks and board a ship, and he landed in America in search of a better life, in search of starting his own farm and in search of a different life and to send money home to his family,” Andrea continued. “And so, he arrived in Michigan and then worked his way up to Skiff, Alberta.” Nearly 130 years later, Albert Green’s courage and bravery continue to reap rewards. Shipwheel covers about 900 acres of grassland and comprises a yearling grazing program, a 5,500-head cattle feedlot, bee pollinators, pasture-raised chickens, a no-till “chaos” garden, a fruit orchard and agricultural compost production. Andrea is the fourth generation of her family to manage the operation, but in the same spirit as Great-Grandpa Green, she still searches the horizon for unforeseen opportunities. Shipwheel defines a “chaos” garden as the following: “The basic idea behind a chaos garden: Mix the seeds in a bag, scatter in loose soil and then sit back and see what happens. As long as you start with soil that’s somewhat loose and bare on the surface, some will sprout and take root. We choose to use cattle to ‘disturb’ the land instead of some means of mechanical tillage because with mechanical tillage we would definitely destroy the habitat of the millions of microbes that take residence in the topsoil.” “I feel an immense responsibility for the way that I not only maintain what we currently have, but now, I feel like I have to push past where we are and do more,” Andrea said. “Do better. Be bigger.” Paddocks lead to productivity boost When Andrea says she feels the need to “do better,” she is not just talking about economics. Sustainability and caring for the land are important aspects of Shipwheel’s modus operandi, and she credits her father, Blake, with implementing this ethos. In the early 1980s, Blake — with baby Andrea in tow — attended a conference on holistic farm management held by Zimbabwean ecologist Allan Savory. The sparsely attended talk touched on topics that were considered radical at the time but struck a chord with Blake. “Everything that he was saying made completely logical sense in Dad's brain, and it was different than anything he'd ever done in agriculture thus far,” Andrea said. “But it was logical: working with the ecosystem, allowing the plant to rest and photosynthesize — and, I mean, we didn't know as much then as we do now about what happens underneath the ground as far as microbes and storing carbon and mycorrhizal fungi and the functional glomalin and all those things, but we knew about photosynthesis, and we knew about ecosystems and the water cycle and mineral cycle, and all those things made sense.” Blake went straight to work on converting their long-established continual grazing operation into 65 different paddocks and three separate grazing cells. While this move may have been seen as peculiar, or even ridiculous, by their peers, for the descendants of Albert Green, decisions like this were what drove the success of the family business. After adopting holistic land management practices — or what Andrea personally refers to as “adaptive multi-paddock grazing” — the benefits were soon obvious. Improvements in the physical look of the land, the water cycle and the mineral cycle told the family that they were becoming more productive and definitely better than average. These changes also brought more wildlife and forage to the land. But it was not until many years later, when Andrea took her place at the helm of the operation, that the family saw the proof of just how much these radical changes had boosted their business. Digging out and poring over faded, yellowed grazing charts and pictures dating back to 1982, Andrea traced the farm’s stocking days, revealing that they had gone from an initial 2.36 stock days per acre to reaching around 110 stock days per acre this year. From where they started, this is an increase in productivity of a staggering 3,862%. “I had to do the math four times to convince myself,” Andrea admitted. “When I looked back to the Ecological Suggested Stocking Rate, which was for our soil type in our area, I realized that we were stocking cattle at six times the suggested stocking rate.” Of course, there are bigger-picture benefits to multi-paddock grazing. Moving the cattle between paddocks allows the natural vegetation to flourish and, most importantly, to photosynthesize. Plants use energy from sunlight to build carbohydrates from CO2 and water. Most of the carbohydrates plants produce go into growth, but they also release exudates into the soil, which helps build up soil carbon and creates a healthy soil microbiome. Even with cattle feeding on any given day, Andrea says that 30% of the vegetation is able to photosynthesize. Overall, this means that, along with significantly increasing production, Shipwheel has also managed to integrate natural carbon sequestration methods into the operation, reducing greenhouse gas emissions. From feedlot waste to fertilizer: Creating nutrient-rich compost Another environmentally friendly procedure established by Blake was the upcycling of Shipwheel’s feedlot waste into nutrient-rich compost. This idea again came from a class he attended, after which Blake immediately integrated a process for utilizing the 20,000 metric tons of organic matter — namely, manure and bedding — from the feedlot. According to Andrea, through this process, the operation produces an average of somewhere between 10,000 to 15,000 metric tons of compost. Half of this is used on Shipwheel land as an organic fertilizer, while the other half is sold to local farmers, who are more than happy to use it on their own land. “We see the compost as a tool to (impact) many acres of land,” Andrea said. “Over the last few years, we have seen that the demand for compost has increased to the point that we can’t meet demand with our current supply.” With the popularity of their compost products, the Shipwheel team has not only found another way of successfully gaining profits through sustainability, but it has also managed to demonstrate the advantages of using sustainable practices to their peers. In four generations, the business has gone from one person taking a determined shot at building a better life to an enterprise that is now showing others how bold moves can create positive change. Looking at what Shipwheel has grown into and where they could go from here, Andrea is confident that her Great-Grandpa Green would look fondly on his legacy. “He had the dream that he was going to be a farmer, but he didn't necessarily know how successful he was going to be,” Andrea surmised. “He didn't know that the fourth generation was even going to be here, right? “And I don't know what the eighth generation is going to look like,” she continued, “but I think he'd be immensely proud of what he started.” The Shipwheel blueprint The name Shipwheel Cattle Feeders only hints at the scope of the entire operation. Over four generations, the farm has implemented and developed a whole host of innovative projects. Taking an all-encompassing look at Shipwheel, the blueprint incorporates: Multi-paddock adaptive yearling grazing A 5,500-head cattle feedlot Beekeeping Pasture-raised chickens A no-till \"chaos” garden A fruit orchard Manure compost production Vermicompost What sets Shipwheel apart is their unwavering dedication to their holistic management goal of continually improving their land base, the animals entrusted to their care and the community. Let us take a deeper dive into some of the innovative activities on the farm. 1. Low-stress handling (especially during the receiving period) In 2014, Shipwheel was approached by a customer who wanted to feed cattle without added hormones or antibiotics. They jumped on the opportunity, looking to the knowledge, skill and cattle handling principles taught by rancher Bud Williams. Named one of the “Top Ten Innovations” in the beef industry by Beef Producer in 2011, Bud’s revolutionary stockmanship, combined with high-quality feed and focusing on individual animal care, aligned with the customer’s needs. This philosophy highlights the importance of focusing on the animals’ emotional well-being, outlining a direct correlation between it and performance. Shipwheel took the knowledge of cattle handling that Bud taught and used it to help boost depressed immune systems and maintain healthy cattle. “Cattle are herd animals,” explained Andrea. “They far prefer to move as a herd. Our job as caregivers or handlers of the cattle is to gain the trust of the herd through our posture, position, distance and angles while handling. When the cattle have confidence in us as their caregivers, we are then actually able to take the herd for a walk. “Proper exercise for the herd releases their stress, which will decrease (their) cortisol response, thus increasing the suppressed immune system and breaking the negative cycle of stress,” she continued. “Just as humans would reduce stress through movement individually — by going for a walk, for example — cattle can release stress with proper exercise, but (they) need to do this as a herd as opposed to individually.” In 2017–2018, Shipwheel fed more than 3,500 ranch-direct cattle. The average weight of the heifers and steers was 451 pounds and 508 pounds, respectively. They were not treated with antibiotics on arrival, were not fed ionophores and did not receive implants. Only 4.74% of the heifers and 6.06% of the steers were treated with antibiotics by the time they weighed 850 pounds. Every member of the Shipwheel crew must understand Bud's cattle handling concepts and continually practice and apply them. The other leading figure in stockmanship research is Colorado State University professor Temple Grandin. While Bud and Temple differ on their approach and application, ultimately, both have the same goal of working with cattle’s natural tendencies to minimize stress and improve animal welfare through handling. Temple’s research work has changed how we handle cattle across North America and has provided the science to back up what Bud found in the pen — low-stress handling just makes good sense.

Composting Fifteen years ago, Andrea’s father took a composting class. He came home and started to compost the 20,000 metric tons of manure and bedding from the feedlot to produce an upcycled feedlot waste product. Shipwheel operates a wind-row composting system in which a mixture of raw materials is placed in long, narrow piles or wind-rows. The team observes and monitors the temperatures of the rows, and when they get to 150–160 degrees Fahrenheit, they turn them with a compost turner. This process helps to aerate the composting materials. The end product is a natural fertilizer high in nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, calcium and sulfur. Compost helps increase the biological health of the soil, and it also helps decrease the need for synthetic fertilizer. In one teaspoon of compost, there are 1 billion microbes (e.g., bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, protozoa and nematodes), which are invaluable for boosting soil and plant health. In Taber, Alberta, Canada, Shipwheel is surrounded by high-value irrigated land used to grow crops such as corn, onions, potatoes, pumpkins and canola. Because of their proximity to this land, they can sell a high-value byproduct to the farmers. “Every year, in the spring, we clean our pens and put the manure, bedding and whatever other green material we can get our hands on into wind-rows on our (National Resource Conservation Board)-approved compost pad,” Andrea explained. “On average, we haul out about 10,000 wet metric tons that will turn into approximately 5,000 dry metric tons for us to sell. “We will also sell small amounts of compost to members of our community as a community outreach project,” continued Andrea. “We like the thought of two neighbors comparing gardens (and) saying, ‘Oh, that Shipwheel compost made some great big tomatoes.’ It gives them good feelings about Shipwheel in their community and about regenerative agriculture.” Shipwheel also boasts a vermicomposting operation. This system of compost bins houses roughly 16,000 red wiggler and European night crawler worms that break down everyday household waste into vermicompost. This mineral-rich soil additive is full of beneficial microbes. Shipwheel sells their vermicompost product, as well as worms for others to make their own.

Carbon sequestration Andrea is passionate about increasing the storage of carbon in the soil, and Shipwheel has been involved in a study of technology that measures exactly that. This project has seen Andrea work with soil microbiologist Dr. Kris Nichols, a leader in the movement to regenerate soils for healthy soil, crops, food, people and the planet. Andrea has also collaborated with Kim Cornish, director of the Food Water Wellness Foundation, an organization that works with farmers, ranchers and researchers to understand how soil can be used to mitigate climate change, droughts and flooding, increase biodiversity and, most importantly, produce healthy food.​​ “I am very grateful to Dr. Kris Nichols and Kim Cornish,” she said. “These two outstanding women leaders have helped me learn about soil health, mycorrhizal fungi, glomalin and their role in storing carbon and building soil aggregates.” The Shipwheel team hopes that by working with organizations developing a carbon measurement system, they can put a value on the carbon that they have been sequestering. By maintaining the grassland, keeping the carbon in the soil and putting a value on that carbon, Shipwheel will potentially be able to increase their income per acre in order to compare with high-value cultivated crops, such as potatoes. Early indications from their participation in the study show that Shipwheel has stored an estimated minimum of 230 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per hectare and as high as 800 metric tons of CO2 equivalent per hectare. The current Canadian federal government has committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to 30% below the 2005 levels by 2030. “What if the cattle feeders, the beef producers and the agriculture industry were the solution to that?” asked Andrea. Shipwheel is a one-of-a-kind farming enterprise, but the principles they follow are being used throughout the world.

The sector is in its infancy compared to other areas of agriculture; however, this provides the opportunity to adjust quickly when necessary. Climate change is forcing the global food industry to find ways to be more sustainable, and the aquaculture industry has spent many years campaigning for change to ensure longevity and sustainability for future generations. It is necessary to look outside of our comfort zone to ensure that we are protecting our oceans and the aquatic species that live in them. At the same time, we must also provide food security for over 3 billion people who rely on seafood for their diet and employment and support its role in ending hunger and addressing malnutrition. 1. Protecting our oceans In 2016, the National Academy of Science, USA, predicted 50% of stocks could be sustainable by 2050. The last decade has seen considerable developments in fishery management limits, species quotas and reduced bycatch through advances in fishing gear and technological equipment. NGOs such as the Marine Stewardship Council have worked tirelessly to improve this situation, and globally, there is amazing conservation work taking place to ensure that aquaculture and fisheries are becoming more sustainable. Aquaculture is becoming more resource-efficient in terms of aquafeed, energy and water management. Indoor and land-based technologies are reducing water usage and gas emissions. By 2030, 62% of food fish will come from aquaculture (FAO). Sustainable aquaculture is part of the solution and will be the key to providing future generations access to healthy and sustainable protein options and employment opportunities. This is the part where each of us, as individuals, plays a role in protecting our oceans. We have a responsibility, we all play a part in climate change and we need to work together if we are to influence current practices. What can we do to support this? We can support companies, stores and restaurants that use sustainably sourced fish and seafood. We can research our choices to ensure we are choosing the most sustainable option to reduce environmental impact. 2. Fish in fish out (FIFO) Modern aquaculture has seen a significant shift in the last decade in terms of nutrition. Marine ingredients in aquafeed still exist, but some aquafeeds are made free of any marine resources while still maintaining the health benefits associated with omega 3 fatty acids and oils. The evolution of nutrition has allowed for the FIFO ratio to decrease significantly. The global FIFO factor for our industry is 0.27, which means we need 270 grams of wild-caught fish to produce 1 kilogram of farmed fish. This is calculated by dividing the fish caught for aquaculture feed production use by the farmed fish fed with these feeds. Looking at Alltech Coppens, the 2020 FIFO ratio was 0.10%, and 100% of the fishmeal sourced was from trimmings and/or certified. 3. Food security The 2021 FAO cites the importance of seafood for ending hunger and addressing malnutrition, and fish remains critical for food and nutritional security in so many geographies across the world. To cut out eating fish entirely would wipe out some rural communities who rely on fishing for their livelihood and primary protein source. Sustainable fishing must be implemented and promoted; fish stocks can recover and replenish when carefully managed for the long term. One of the greatest challenges we face in agriculture is to produce enough food for the increasing population while ensuring a plentiful and sustainable environment for future generations. Our population is growing exponentially, and we cannot continue to produce proteins in an unsustainable manner. This is not a new learning; both the agriculture and aquaculture industries have recognized this, and significant innovations and developments have been made over the past decade. Years of research have been invested in ensuring minimal impact on surrounding environments. Sustainable aquaculture is part of the solution, not the problem, with 62% of food fish coming from aquaculture by 2030 (FAO). This will be the key to providing future generations access to healthy and sustainable protein options and employment opportunities. As an industry, we have been campaigning and will continue to campaign for change for many years on some of the industry’s most important challenges. It is now up to each of us to educate ourselves and our communities to make the most sustainable food choices. We must take part for the change to have an impact.

It is impossible not to notice the increases in most items we buy, including horse feed. Instead of just accepting that everything is more expensive right now, I investigated the root causes of the increasing cost to feed a horse and can offer recommendations on making the most of the nutrition in your horse’s feed bag. We are currently experiencing three critical factors in world markets that directly impact the ingredients in a feed bag: 1. First and foremost, there is a trucking shortage. This is a hangover from the effects of COVID-19 that is still being reorganized, whether we want to admit it or not. With fewer trucks on the road and different mandates restricting how trucks can cross borders, the current reality is that the transportation industry is challenging. Many minerals and other commodities, such as wheat and oats, must be transported between countries and states. Additionally, as fuel prices have increased due to conflict around the world, freight charges have increased too. These input costs to get a bag of horse feed to your local dealer directly impact the price you pay. 2. The weather patterns over the last year, including drought, resulted in a poor growing season and caused dramatic price increases in oats, flax and horse hay, to name a few. To put it simply, fewer trucks and ingredients lead to increased hay and feed prices. 3. The world is interconnected. For example, Russia and Ukraine together produce approximately 14% of the world’s wheat crop and about 80% of the world’s sunflower seed production (some estimates are higher). This means that the current conflict is not just horrifying on a human level but also directly impacting agriculture and the commodities that are often used to formulate your horse’s feed bag. Is there any good news? Yes! Commodity prices are cyclical. As the human race, we have been through many difficult times previously, and we will make it through this period of history as well. The best things that we can all do right now include: 1. Do not panic: Perhaps cliché, but fear does not do anyone any favors. Do your best with what you have in this moment. Staying in a steady state will be your superpower during these times (i.e., let us not all panic buy like we did when COVID-19 came onto the scene). 2. Develop your curiosity: Rather than jumping to conclusions about increasing prices, I would encourage you to do your own research and really take the time to understand what is going on. Read articles and news sources that you would not normally read. Talk to experts. Embrace the fact that there is much to learn. 3. Give each other (including your local feed dealer!) grace as we all navigate the current challenges: No one is out to get you or your wallet. Having grace and understanding is what others require from you at this time. How horse owners can save money on feed The other good news is that there are a few ways to ensure that you are getting the most from your horse’s nutrition. Some things to try include: 1. Feeding efficient feed: Yes, prices are high right now, but you can make the most of each dollar by choosing high-quality horse nutrition programs. For instance, feeds that use science-backed pre- and probiotics can help improve your horse’s ability to digest and absorb nutrients, which means that less of the money you spend per bag will be excreted as waste. 2. Feeding hay in a slow feeder or hay net: As you know, hay is the most important part of a horse’s diet. Slow feeders and hay nets can help minimize hay waste by horses and also contribute to horse health by offering a consistent supply of forage. 3. Feeding organic minerals: As noted above, one component of increasing prices has to do with weather patterns. While we will never have control of Mother Nature, doing our best to minimize environmental impact is crucial. Organic minerals are better utilized by the horse, which means that fewer are excreted into the environment. Choosing horse diets with 100% organic minerals can help reduce your environmental footprint. In summary The point of this article is not to incite fear, start a political conversation or make anyone angry. The point here is that horse feed prices have increased, and many, including myself, are asking why. The reality is that the last few years have been challenging in many ways, and we are still experiencing the repercussions. If nothing else, I hope this article reminds you that we are all connected. It is not about one country, one state or even one city. The world relies on us in many ways, and it is more important than ever that we start to realize that. Maybe you feel disconnected from what is happening across the country or around the world, but it truly has an impact on our lives, even at the level of how much we pay for a bag of horse feed. My hope is that this blog opened your eyes a little bit more to the current world climate. I hope that you can start to see that everyone is doing their best right now, and maybe, just maybe, if we can offer one another the grace and compassion to navigate these times, we will come out stronger and more connected on the other side.

There, he reflects on his relationship with farming, which is rooted in a tradition going back almost forty years, beginning when his family made the move from their homeland in Holland to their current homestead in Canada. Upon making the choice to continue this farming tradition, VanDenAkker began farming full-time on his own land and tending his herd after earning a degree from the University of Guelph. Since then, he has grown his herd to over 100 head, added milking robots to modernize his operation, and is continuously seeking how to become a better, more efficient and sustainable farmer. Through his years of experience, VanDenAkker knows the importance of being cognizant of what goes into his dairy cows in terms of what they eat and the balance of nutrients required to maintain his herd health and optimal milk production. However, he was unsure if he would be able to support his herd with the yields from his own fields. Everything we grow goes into our cows “Everything we grow goes into our cows,” VanDenAkker noted when discussing the 250 acres of corn that is farmed and destined for his own silage. “I didn’t know if I could feed them enough to support the milk.” VanDenAkker has long used Alltech products such as Yea-Sacc and Optigen in his livestock feed, and five years ago, he was introduced to Grain-Set, an Alltech Crop Science product geared toward grain crops. He began applying it on 40 of his silage corn acres, and over the years since, he has seen consistent results at every harvest. “Year after year, we are seeing improved cob fill and an increase in the number of bushels we are getting from those fields when compared to the untreated area,” VanDerAkken said, adding that his average increase is more than 10 bushels per acre. This crop yield increase is formidable, but the data that really impressed VanDenAkker came after he began feeding his Grain-Set-treated corn silage to his cows. “They increased their milk production when we switched,” he said. “I saw a trend in the increase but couldn’t be sure (that it was totally related to Grain-Set).” Backed by Science VanDenAkker’s curiosity about the results prompted him to dig deeper into what he was seeing, and he decided to send samples of both his treated and untreated corn silage for analytical testing. The results spoke for themselves: The Alltech Crop Science-treated corn silage showed a 5.8% increase in neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility. This meant that the dairy cows were getting more energy and taking in more nutrients from the feed, allowing them to not only increase their milk production but to also have more balanced rumen health. These improvements help increase farmers’ profitability and make their systems more efficient. What is the science behind these results? Simply put: nutrigenomics. Gene expression helps corn silage crops better withstand environmentally stressful conditions, like drought or overly wet soils, and both biotic and abiotic stress. The plants respond by inducing their own resistance to these stressors and improving their own performance. Based on these results, VanDenAkker is enthusiastic about his plans to continue using Grain-Set on his silage corn. When asked about the difference he has seen in his cows, VanDenAkker smiled pragmatically and said, “I feed the cows myself, and I can see the results for myself. They are eating better and getting what they need from the feed. I always had good cows, but they are very decent now.” What is Grain-Set? Grain-Set is a unique blend of micronutrients and fermentation products and is specifically formulated for cereal, grain, forage and oil crop production.

Proud to call Vermont home since 1932, this fourth-generation family-owned business offers personalized service — including one-on-one animal nutrition consultations, lab-based forage analysis and customized recommendations — along with the manufacturing and delivery of premium animal feeds. Poulin Grain’s diverse customer base includes livestock producers and animal enthusiasts throughout the eastern U.S. and Canada. As noted by company president Josh Poulin, the nearly 90-year-old business “[has] always been committed to delivering high-quality animal nutrition products at a fair value, and taking care of [its] people, animals and customers.” Based in Newport, Vermont, Poulin Grain serves a wide range of customers throughout the eastern U.S. and Canada, including many dairy producers. Managing mycotoxins in feed and forage Poulin Grain maintains a steadfast focus on serving the animal and meeting their requirements, which is why they are consistently exploring new technologies that can help them implement superior quality control and produce animal feeds of only the highest caliber. The company’s northeastern U.S. location — a region often referred to as “mycotoxin central” — led to them initially building a relationship with Alltech. The two companies worked together to implement a mycotoxin control program at Poulin’s mills while also helping their nutrition teams and customers understand more about this dynamic problem on-farm, which includes a central focus on enhancing forage quality. Why mycotoxin testing is necessary A 2021 study from Weaver et al. highlighted the prevalence of these toxic compounds in U.S. corn grain and corn silage by analyzing the results of almost 2,000 grain and forage samples across seven years. Findings showed that the mean numbers of mycotoxins per sample were 4.8 and 5.2 in grain and silage, respectively. These findings are often replicated in the ongoing testing carried out by Alltech’s 37+® mycotoxin analysis laboratory network. For example, in 2021, over 7,000 tests revealed that an astounding 95% of samples contained two or more mycotoxins. In recent years, several factors have combined to exacerbate the mycotoxin risk in animal diets worldwide. More extreme weather patterns, such as droughts and floods, are creating extra stress on crops, which is one of the primary predisposing factors for mold and mycotoxin development. Additionally, the shift to no-till crop establishment and reduced crop rotation is leading to a greater buildup of crop residues, which only serves to increase the mycotoxin risk in subsequent crops. How mycotoxins impact animals Mycotoxins can be the root cause of numerous problems on-farm. However, some of the more common mycotoxin symptoms include: Digestive disorders, such as diarrhea. Reproductive challenges, such as decreased fertility and abnormal estrous cycles. Reduced animal performance, often linked to reduced feed consumption and nutrient utilization. Compromised health, related to suppressed immunity and increased disease risk. As demonstrated by the routine mycotoxin analysis mentioned above, the presence of multiple mycotoxins in grains and forages tends to be the norm rather than the exception. This may lead to additional or synergistic effects, further compounding the mycotoxin problem for livestock producers. Taking a proactive approach to mycotoxin management Although mycotoxins are often chemically stable enough to survive food and feed processing — meaning it is virtually impossible to eliminate them from the supply chain — there are some key steps that can be taken to enhance control efforts. John Winchell serves as Alltech’s Northeast U.S. territory sales manager, where he has worked with Poulin Grain for nearly two years. When working through mycotoxin challenges, John has always believed it’s best to take a more proactive approach. “When you think of mycotoxin management, I think it’s much more than just a product — it’s a program; [one that involves] looking at pre-harvest and post-harvest strategies, and [considering] different things, such as climate, population, and varieties,” John explains. “[This paints] a total picture as opposed to [taking a] reactive [approach].” Aided by Winchell’s support throughout the crop-growing season, Poulin Grain and their dairy nutrition customers have implemented steps to help enhance forage quality and produce superior quality dairy feeds. For example, to manage grain and forage quality post-harvest, John introduced Poulin Grain to both the Alltech 37+ mycotoxin analysis and Alltech RAPIREAD®. Alltech 37+ is a lab-based mycotoxin detection method that can identify up to 54 individual mycotoxins, including those in total mixed rations (TMRs). Alltech RAPIREAD utilizes a portable testing module to quickly detect six key mycotoxins. It is typically used directly on-farm or in the feed mill due to its ability to deliver quick results, often in less than 15 minutes. “Working with [Alltech] 37+ to look at the different samples on different commodities and forages has really helped us get closer to where we need to be on forage quality and cow health,” states Winchell, while also highlighting how Poulin Grain were early adopters of Alltech RAPIREAD, thereby allowing mycotoxin control decisions to be activated on the same day that a challenge is identified. Optimizing dairy forage quality is a key focus area for both Poulin Grain and Alltech. Maximizing livestock productivity Poulin Grain is no stranger to adaption and innovation, as noted by general manager and senior vice president Mike Tetreault, “One of the key things for Poulin Grain to continue to be leaders in animal nutrition is we must be innovative. And part of being innovative for us is having the right products, services and technologies [in place].” That is where John Winchell and Alltech come in. According to Tetreault, “[Winchell] has been a tremendous asset for us — he’s been really committed [to serving] all our customers and covering every area. He’s been a true source of support, education and growth for all our customers and [our] company. I don’t know what we’d do without this Alltech service.” From starting with a simple introductory webinar to today implementing the latest in mycotoxin detection, Mike feels the Poulin team has now become experts in managing mycotoxins and is far more able to make informed decisions. What lies ahead As Poulin Grain’s business continues to grow and develop the ways in which it serves its diverse customer base, Tetreault is excited about what lies ahead. “When we find problems that really need further investigation, Alltech’s 37+ [program] has been there to support us dramatically for the last year,” he says. “We’ve had several situations where we’ve been able to help and correct management [on-farm]. It’s really been a great run, and I know that going forward, utilizing these Alltech services, products and technologies will [continue to] truly be an asset for Poulin Grain.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/managing-east-coast-animal-feed-mycotoxin-challenge","title":"\n\n                    Managing the east coast animal feed mycotoxin challenge\n                    ","date":"August 18, 2022","contentLength":1132}},{"pageContent":"From June 2022, a zinc oxide ban, prohibiting the use of therapeutic doses of zinc oxide (ZnO) in animal feeds to control post-weaning diarrhea in piglets will come into effect in the European Union (EU). Although ZnO can still be used as a feed additive after this date, it will only be allowed at the maximum permitted dose rate of 150 ppm total dietary zinc. Before we discuss why all EU pig producers need to be ready to rear their pigs without pharmacological levels of ZnO by 2022, it is important to understand why the use of high levels of ZnO in swine nutritional diets has increased dramatically across the globe in recent years. Where it all began At weaning, piglets are subject to a multitude of stress factors over a very short period that contribute to gastrointestinal tract and immune system disturbances. These factors can be: 1. Nutritional: Abrupt dietary change from sow milk to a dry, pelleted, predominantly vegetable-based diet formulation. 2. Environmental: Moving to new nursery accommodation with different housing conditions. 3. Health-based: Loss of passive immunity from the sow. 4. Physiological: Abrupt maternal separation, being handled and transported and mixing with unfamiliar pigs from other litters. Because the pigs are under such stress, the early post-weaning period is typically characterized by poor growth performance (e.g., reduced feed intake) and increased susceptibility to post-weaning diarrhea. Traditionally, pig producers relied heavily on antibiotic growth promoters in pre-starter and starter feeds to control pathogenic infections (mainly caused by enterotoxigenic E. coli) and improve pig growth performance in the first few weeks after weaning. This was common practice until various governmental bodies banned the use of antibiotics as growth promoters, such as the European Parliament in 2003, due to growing concerns over increasing levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The continual spread of AMR has dangerous consequences for not only animal but also human health. Following this ban, pig producers had to seek alternatives to maintain optimal gut health and to reduce this post-weaning performance drop. As a result, the use of high levels of ZnO in piglet feeds (2,000 ppm or higher) became more widespread and was seen as common practice in the swine industry. It was shown to be an effective and relatively inexpensive tool for preventing and controlling post-weaning diarrhea, with subsequent improvements in piglet growth performance, feed intake and digestion. Although the precise mode of action of ZnO against post-weaning diarrhea in weaned piglets is not yet fully understood, it is believed to be related to a significant improvement in both intestinal morphology (i.e., improved structure and function) and nutrient digestion and absorption. Why ban pharmacological levels of ZnO? Though there are several benefits of using ZnO in piglet feeds (preventing post-weaning diarrhea, maintaining health and performance, etc.), recent reports have highlighted its environmental impact, and we became aware of its contribution to the spread of AMR. It is, therefore, not surprising that regulations around its use are changing and why the EU decided to ban the use of pharmacological levels of ZnO in June 2022. However, it is not all bad news for the European pig industry, as there are several potential benefits to the upcoming ban on ZnO. Some of these benefits are: 1. Reduced environmental pollution As previously mentioned, there are environmental concerns over the continued use of high levels of ZnO. This is primarily because zinc accumulates in soil after zinc-rich pig manure is applied to the land as an organic fertilizer. These high levels of zinc in the soil and surface water are deemed an environmental pollutant and health risk and may also impact the absorption of other trace elements, such as iron. 2. Preventing antimicrobial resistance Recent studies and reports have demonstrated ZnO’s contribution to the increase of AMR, as high levels of ZnO may increase the proportion of multi-drug-resistant E. coli in the intestines of piglets. 3. Avoiding zinc toxicity Zinc remains a heavy metal and is, therefore, toxic to many living organisms, including pigs. Studies show that prolonged use of pharmacological levels of ZnO may negatively affect piglet health and performance, as demonstrated by a marked decrease in feed intake. 4. Preventing nutritional interactions High levels of ZnO can have a negative effect on phytase activity (an enzyme that is included in piglet feeds to enhance digestion), whereby the phosphorous cannot be released from phytase due to the formation of a complex of zinc with P-phytate. When ZnO is removed from piglet feeds, it should have a positive effect on phytase efficiency. 5. Avoiding changes to gut microbial composition The use of pharmacological doses of ZnO may also cause changes to the gut microbial composition of piglets during the early post-weaning period by suppressing the growth of beneficial bacteria, such as Lactobacilli. Such changes may negatively affect intestinal development and health in young piglets. What is in store for pig-producing countries outside the EU? Canada: Until recently, ZnO was typically included in piglet feeds at 2,500–5,000 ppm in Canada. However, Canada is now in the midst of imposing similar restrictions to that of the EU, which will see the level of ZnO allowed in piglet feeds reduced down to nutritional levels of 350 ppm. China: The use of high levels of ZnO also came under scrutiny in China, and, as a result, China has drastically reduced its level of authorized dietary zinc supplementation, going from 2,250 ppm to 1,600 ppm in 2018. United States and some Asian countries: It is very likely that the United States and some Asian countries will also implement similar restrictions on the use of pharmacological levels of ZnO in piglet diets in the near future. Although there are no restrictions currently in place in these regions, it is vital that swine producers avoid over use and start the process of working towards ZnO alternatives so that they are prepared when a ban inevitably comes into effect. Until recently, ZnO represented one of the vital nutritional strategies for preventing and controlling diarrhea in young piglets and the associated detrimental post-weaning ‘growth check.’ However, increasing concerns over environmental pollution and contributions to the spread of AMR have led to an EU ban on the use of high levels of ZnO in piglet diets. Adopting a holistic strategy that encompasses optimal nutrition, management, biosecurity, health and welfare practices will be key to ensuring that pigs can thrive and survive in a post-ZnO era.

With pets living longer and a large percentage of pets classified as obese, it comes as no surprise that we are seeing a rise in associated health issues, including osteoarthritis, diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, certain types of cancers and cognitive decline. How can we address some of these challenges, especially those related to cognitive function in pets? 1. Take a preventative, nutrition-based approach. Providing proper nutrition is still considered one of the most effective and financially viable ways to decrease an animal’s disease risk. An important part of any animal’s health and diet is immuno-nutrition, which can be defined as the effect of providing specific nutrients — typically, a combination of certain amino acids, nucleic acids, vitamins and minerals — on the animal’s immune system. With the direct link between a healthy digestive system and immunity, the importance of gut health cannot be overstated. Gut health, immunity and the microbiome have also been shown to be linked to cognitive health. Research in this area has proven that the gut and the brain communicate regularly through a highly complex interactive system. This highlights the important role of nutrition, not only for the growing and developing puppy, but for the aging or senior dog as well. 2. Optimize gut health by increasing microbial diversity. Gut health can be improved and maintained in several ways, but increasing microbial diversity — as well as reducing pathogens and increasing beneficial bacteria, such as the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacteria species — is key. Adding prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics to an animal’s gut health program has been well-researched and established as important for maintaining good gut health. Furthermore, products such as mannan-rich fractions of yeast (MRF) and certain fermentation solubles — including mannan oligosaccharides (MOS) — as well as nucleotides and branched-chain amino acids are being incorporated into pet food for dogs and cats at a growing rate. Senior or geriatric dogs tend to have reduced concentrations of Bifidobacteria species, and studies of MOS have shown that they are correlated with significant increases in beneficial populations, which can help offset the negative effects of age on colonic health. MRF have also proven to be beneficial in pet diets in several ways. They basically provide a source of attachment for certain pathogens and escort them through the digestive tract, preventing colonization and reversing dysbiosis. MRF also support nutrient utilization, help maintain digestive function and enzyme activity and work to control inflammation. 3. Support immunity and cognitive health in dogs and cats with antioxidants. We’ve looked at how immuno-nutrients affect gut health, but what impact do they have on the overall immune system? Trace minerals are essential in many metabolic and physiological processes, and using the organic, more bioavailable form of these essential nutrients has been proven to be beneficial in multiple ways. Recent companion animal studies of Bioplex® and Sel-Plex® showed that, even when supplemented at much lower levels than their inorganic counterparts, these two products supported and promoted better trace mineral status, bone mineral density, growth and immune measures in both cats and dogs. Certain trace minerals, including selenium, are also known to be important antioxidants. Since antioxidants can help minimize free-radical formation and oxidative stress, including them in pets’ diets is often considered an important part of any immune-nutrient strategy to help prevent and managed age-related health issues. Some of the leading age-related health problems in pets include immune-related issues, joint health, cancer, diabetes and heart disease. Two other emerging concerns and interests for pet owners with older pets are cognitive health and function. When it comes to cognitive health, there have been several studies linking antioxidants and their role in counteracting oxidative stress to potential improvements in cognitive performance. It seems that impaired neuroprotection that results from oxidative stress has been implicated in neurodegeneration, and as such, inhibitors of oxidative damage — especially antioxidants — are considered very promising as potential preventatives. Selenium is considered to be not only a very powerful antioxidant but a major agent of immune stimulation as well. Several studies in humans, companion animals and other species have shown that selenium can reduce oxidative damage, optimize immunity and thyroid health, and even help prevent mental decline. The problem with selenium is that its availability, utilization and efficacy depend on the dietary source or form in which it is provided. Inorganic selenium (i.e., sodium selenate or sodium selenite), the most widely used form of selenium, is not only highly toxic; it is also poorly absorbed, can induce DNA damage and can have very strong pro-oxidative properties, making it a poor choice as an antioxidant. Because of toxicity concerns, inclusion rates for selenium are regulated, and the suggested levels are set with an eye toward preventing a deficiency rather than supplementing for optimized immunity and health. As such, it is worthwhile to reconsider our selenium supplementation strategies and find ways to maximize selenium status that, ultimately, support cognitive health as well. An animal’s selenium status can easily be improved by substituting inorganic selenium with the organic form of the mineral, such as that included in Sel-Plex. Studies of Sel-Plex have evaluated its potential antioxidant characteristics in several species, including transgenic mice, and the results have shown a substantial increase in glutathione peroxidase and significantly decreased levels of DNA and RNA oxidation. Poor selenium status, on the other hand, has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease. Selenium has been shown to lower markers of inflammation, indicating that it may help decrease an animal’s risk of heart disease by reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, which have been linked to atherosclerosis. Since pets are also susceptible to certain heart conditions, implementing nutritional strategies to improve selenium status and, in turn, reduce oxidative stress and any subsequent inflammation could potentially have positive benefits for geriatric pets as well. Conclusion Thanks to the growing trend of increased awareness and interest from pet owners about the overall health and well-being of their animal companions, we can expect nutrition to play an even more prominent role as part of a preventive approach to maintaining pet health. The importance of the pet microbiome cannot be underestimated, as it serves as the foundation of a healthy GI tract, immunity and overall health through all life stages. When looking at antioxidants, the opportunity also exists to make seemingly small changes — like switching from inorganic selenium to an organic source — that can actually have a significant impact on the overall immunity, health and cognitive function of the animal. Immuno-nutrients will continue to be an important part of a targeted nutritional approach to caring for pets, but it is also important to look for product-specific research and validation when creating your pets’ health plan.

Speaking at the Alltech ONE Ideas Conference in June 2021, Ben Lamberigts, manager of quality, research and nutrition at Alltech Coppens, offered his insight on nutrition for a sustainable future through the four pillars of fish nutrition concept. The current state of aquaculture feed production A rapidly growing aquaculture industry has led to increasing demand for good quality aquaculture feed. Yet, the availability of fishmeal is limited. Even if we reduce 50% of the world’s fishmeal inclusion, we still need almost 1.5 million metric tons of fishmeal by 2050, which is simply not available. “It’s a challenge that we have to solve before we can grow the aquaculture industry,” said Lamberigts. “But the industry is working on this, and we are doing a very good job.” In fact, we have already lowered the fish in fish out (FIFO) factor since the ‘90s. Still, we need more fishmeal alternatives, such as: Animal byproducts (hemoglobin, blood meal, poultry meal) Vegetable protein sources (sunflower meal, wheat protein, soybean meal) Insect meals (mealworm, black soldier fly meal) Byproducts from human consumption (fish byproducts or salmon) While the global aquaculture production has achieved a 0.27 FIFO rate, Alltech Coppens even lowered the FIFO factor to 0.10, which means only 100 grams of wild-caught fish is needed to produce 1 kilogram of farmed fish. How did Alltech Coppens do this? Understanding what fish really need “First, we need to understand the basics of nutrition,” noted Lamberigts. “No fish has a requirement for fishmeal or even a requirement for a specific raw material.” What fish require are: Essential nutrients, such as digestible protein, fat for energy, vitamins and minerals Palatable compound feed, so the fish eat the feed Good water quality in aquaculture, because fish swim, defecate and eat in the same environment “If we define the alternatives with these requirements, those alternatives are not alternatives anymore,” Lamberigts continued. “We split them up into single metrics, so we can compare them better between each other and to the fishmeal.” This has been done in human food items. An example is the nutrition score on food packaging. Nutritional scoring, as well as sustainability scoring, helps consumers compare between products. Through labeling and pictograms, the producers now make it possible for them to make the right decision. That is what Alltech Coppens has been doing for the alternatives to fishmeal by dividing them using different metrics that are categorized into four pillars: Palatability, Performance, Pollution and Planet. The four pillars of fish nutrition for a sustainable future 1. Palatability: The feed needs to be palatable for the fish “(Palatability) is the most important pillar because if the food is not eaten by the fish, there is no performance and pollution control is very bad,” Lamberigts explained. The graph below shows a trial with rainbow trout at the maximum feeding level. The y axis represents the feed intake in gram/kilogram metabolic rate, and the x axis shows the taste. There were two different treatments: Blue line: 100% of the protein came from fishmeal (fishmeal-based diet) Green line: 100% of the protein came from vegetable sources (vegetable diet) The diets for these two groups were switched on day four. Interestingly, there was a drop in feeding levels for both diets. That means that even the fish that received a vegetable diet before day four, that switched over to what was assumed to be a more palatable diet (the fishmeal diet), also had a drop in feeding level; nevertheless, that drop in feeding level recovered much quicker than the other group. From this trial, two crucial metrics regarding palatability were identified: The drop in feeding level after the diet switch The recovery period needed from the change “If we quantify this effect for all the alternatives, we can calculate and make the best combination between the alternatives to get the same performance as what we had with the fishmeal,” noted Lamberigts. 2. Performance: The fish has a need for essential nutrients Energy is the driver of growth. When the energy level increases, the feed conversion ratio (FCR) decreases and the growth performance of the animal rises. Furthermore, energy is responsible for 70% of feed cost. “So, if we increase the energy level of a certain feed by 10%, we also increase the price of that feed by 70%,” said Lamberigts. But what is energy? The gross energy is the energy that is available in that feed ingredient. If the animal can digest that energy, it becomes digestible energy. If the digestible energy is correctly transferred into the animal’s body or maintenance, it becomes net energy. Comparing the net energy of different types of feed, as well as considering palatability and sustainability, can help producers choose the best feed for performance. 3. Pollution: The fish requires good water quality Three main factors that affect water quality are: Uneaten feed Ammonia and phosphorus excretion Feces (how fast they sink, what part is settleable and what part is suspended) An example of pollution control is fat digestibility, which depends a lot on the water temperature. Pollution in terms of fat is becoming a big problem in trout farms with a low water temperature (below 8° Celsius), especially if the feeding level is high. A fatty acid with a low melting point, like linseed or soy oil, has high fat digestibility. In that case, even if the water temperature goes down, the effect is low. Alltech Coppens knows the fatty acid composition of their different alternatives to fishmeal and fish oil. Consequently, they can use this model to predict fat digestibility and prevent fat from polluting the water. 4. Planet: The environmental sustainability of the feed “Being sustainable and assuring that we can grow this industry further, it is becoming a necessity that we quantify the effect of our products, of our raw materials, of our fishmeal alternatives on the environmental impact,” said Lamberigts. Alltech Coppens has been doing this via the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). It is not only looking into the carbon footprint of a single ingredient but also the different parts of how a product is produced, used, distributed and how the waste is treated. Combining all these effects gives Alltech Coppens a total sustainability score of the different raw materials, which helps their customers to choose the right sustainable feed. “If we quantify and measure all these pillars and put them in a software system, we can make the best combination of our alternative protein sources in combination with the fishmeal at the lowest price for the best quality,” noted Lamberigts. Concluding the presentation, Lamberigts hoped he showed the audience that alternatives to fishmeal are not alternatives; they are ingredients. “Insect meal, soy protein, poultry meal; if we are able to quantify the metrics behind these ingredients, we are also able to use them in the proper way,” Lamberigts advised. “When it comes to sustainability, pollution control, performance, palatability, we are now able to use these different alternatives and these different fishmeals in the correct way to ensure the growth of our aquafeed industry.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.

Or, in fact, are you what your food ate?” With these thought-provoking questions, geologist and science writer David Montgomery opened his presentation as part of the Crop Science track at the Alltech ONE Conference (ONE) last May. The author talked at ONE in advance of the launch of his new book, which is aptly titled “What Your Food Ate: How to Heal Our Land and Reclaim Our Health” and is co-authored by his wife, Anne Biklé. “The big point that I’m trying to make is that soil health is our health,” Montgomery said during his presentation. “How we treat the land, in turn, affects how the land will treat us (…) in terms of what's in our food and what that actually may do in terms of supporting our health.” Montgomery explained the various ways that modern farming practices — including tillage and the overuse of commercial fertilizers — are unbalanced and can disrupt the necessary, healthy symbiosis between plants and the soil. “We traded away quality in pursuit of quantity as modernized farming chased higher yields, overlooking a farmer’s natural allies in the soil.” —David Montgomery and Anne Biklé, “What Your Food Ate: How to Heal Our Land and Reclaim Our Health” The roots of good health are planted on farms We know that our diet influences our health, and it’s safe to say that how we grow our crops and what we feed them plays a significant role in our overall health as well. “In general, we don’t think about a plant having a diet, when, in fact, they do,” said Montgomery. “Plants absorb a myriad of elements from the soil which we can consider to be their food, and how we feed them — the ‘diet’ we present them with — will reflect directly in the final outcome.” When determining the health of the soil, it is important to consider some basic elements of crop production, such as the NPK — or the ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in a product — of conventional fertilizers. Applying large amounts of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium can lead to larger crop yields. But what does higher levels of those elements mean for the health of the soil where we grow those crops and the health of the crops themselves? Currently, most farming operations are intensely focused on increasing yields, thanks in part to the pressure of needing to feed a fast-growing population. But if quantity is an important measure, quality — and, more notably, nutrient density — is equally important and, in modern societies, is increasingly worrying. Unbalanced farming practices can disrupt the partnerships between soil bacteria and plants and can have a negative impact on soil health. They also shape the types and amounts of health-promoting minerals, fats and phytochemicals in our crops, which are transferred to us through the foods we eat. Understanding and improving these connections could have profound implications for the food we eat and how we grow it, both now and in the future. Farming practices, soil health and all that it encompasses “Looking around (at) agricultural soil globally, a significantly large portion could be classified as ‘sick,’ if we thought about soil as a living ecosystem having health, which most of us probably don't,” Montgomery said during his presentation at ONE. According to the United Nations’ (U.N.) map of global soil degradation, most of the world's agricultural soils are listed as “degraded” or “very degraded”. Furthermore, the U.N. estimates that around a third of the world's farmland soils have been degraded to the point that their lower quality could have a profound impact on their agricultural productivity. This widespread soil degradation is partially the result of the two fundamental agricultural practices on which conventional agriculture has long been reliant: tillage and the over-use of chemical fertilizers. While tillage has deep historical roots, chemical fertilizers, on the other hand, are much more recent in terms of their development and application. Researchers like Montgomery and Biklé are increasingly acknowledging that these practices can thoroughly degrade the organic matter of soil — which is, in essence, the very life of the soil — and can alter the soil microbial community in ways that are detrimental to both soil health and fertility. The difficult reality, however, is that farmers rely on these practices to harvest much of the food we grow today. Another report from the U.N. released in 2015 projected that we're losing around 0.3% of our ability to produce food every year due to soil erosion and the degradation of organic matter — or, in other words, due to the loss of healthy soils. Montgomery put this statistic in perspective. “0.3% doesn't sound like a really large number on an annual basis, but if you play that out over the rest of this century, it adds up to degrading another third of the world's farmland in this time interval,” he explained. “As the world population continuously grows, that is something that we can't afford.” Harkening back to Montgomery’s application of the concept of health to soil, due to their remarkably low levels or lack of organic matter, many of the world's agricultural soils could be categorized as “sick”. Based on the statistics outlined above, a large percentage of soils simply cannot be called “healthy” in terms of their ability to foster soil biological activity and support strong root development, plant growth and crop productivity. Bringing life back to the ground Regenerative agriculture practices can contribute to rebuilding and revitalizing organic matter, which can, in turn, help rebuild soil health and fertility. Some of the most well-known and effective regenerative agriculture principles include: Low-to-no tillage: Minimizing soil disturbance Cover cropping: Maintaining a permanent ground cover and/or growing cover crops in between cash crops to always keep living roots in the soil Crop rotation: Maintaining a diverse rotation of five to six crops The combination of minimal disturbance, always having something growing in the soil and growing a diverse array of plants is essentially the antithesis of what many farmers and agronomists have been taught and are currently practicing in modern agriculture. “Over the last 100 years, we have emphasized tillage, the overuse of synthetic agrochemicals and specializing in one or two crops,” Montgomery said. “This idea of regenerating soil life and soil health is a different way to look at agriculture and think about soil.” Regenerative farming practices can rebuild soil health, bringing life back to the ground and fostering microorganisms’ communities, as well as their synergistic relationships with plants. These benefits can, in turn, suffuse the soil, the rhizosphere, the plants and the crops they grow with the elements they require in order to thrive, such as macro- and micronutrients, minerals and phytochemicals. Most prominently, regenerative farming practices can increase the amount of carbon in the soil — which basically means more organic matter, as organic matter is roughly 40–50% carbon. A dark soil reflects an increasing sequestration of carbon from the atmosphere into the soil. Photosynthesis is nature’s way of pulling carbon from the atmosphere to the plant, and regenerative agriculture practices are a way to “park” more of that carbon in the soil. Regenerative farming practices can also result in less off-site nitrogen pollution and better water quality as the result of a reduction in the use of synthetic fertilizers. And finally, using more regenerative farming practices could translate to more sustainable and profitable farming. Farmers can achieve comparable or even higher yields by using fewer inputs and fossil fuels — the biggest expenses of modern farming — while also safeguarding natural resources. \"Solutions exist right beneath our feet, if you take the time to read the story of soil.\" —David Montgomery and Anne Biklé, “What Your Food Ate: How to Heal Our Land and Reclaim Our Health” Soil life-focused farming practices hold the key to healing sick soils, allowing farmers to produce enough nutrient-dense food to feed us all and tapping into agriculture’s potential to improve human health. So, when it comes to soil, can we have both quality and quantity? Montgomery wrapped up his presentation at ONE with a sobering yet inspiring message: “What's good for the soil is good for us, too.” Key takeaways Soils have a diet, and healthy diets are required to foster healthy soils Billions of beneficial soil microorganisms foster the symbiotic relationship between soils and plants, making them our top allies for soil and crop health Just like people, soils can be in poor health or in good condition — and globally, our soils currently aren’t in top form The health of the soil impacts the health of our crops, our livestock and, ultimately, ourselves Reestablishing an underground feast for soils will alter what’s on our own plates","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/ripples-soil-health-ground-your-plate","title":"\n\n                    The ripples of soil health: From the ground to your plate  \n                    ","date":"October 18, 2022","contentLength":1478}},{"pageContent":"You may have heard that there are over a billion microbes in every gram of soil. That means that there are more microbes in one spoonful of soil than there are people in the world. An entire world in one small spoonful. What are microbes? When you think of a microbe, you probably think of your high school biology class or the last time you had food poisoning, but they have a hand in so much more. Microbes are microscopic organisms that are all around us. They can be found in soil, water, air, and even in places that would be inhospitable, such as volcanic areas. In agriculture, microbes are involved in various plant processes and form symbiotic relationships with the plants around them. Microbial communities and their products play a significant role in plant health, productivity and vigor. Microbes help plants by doing things such as playing a role in breaking down organic residue, neutralizing potentially toxic compounds in soils, enhancing root growth, improving plant metabolism, increasing a plant’s access to nutrients, providing some disease suppression properties, and not only increasing the plant’s defense mechanisms against stressors but boosting the plant’s resistance to environmental changes and extremes. On the other hand, soils that have less of the microbial presence that plants rely on will also have decreased soil fertility, less organic matter and little organic activity, resulting in a crop that will not reach its potential for growth and development. Microbes are able to provide such services to plants through the different metabolites that they produce during their life cycle. During their lifetimes, microbes — such as nitrogen-fixing bacteria — extract water and minerals from the soil. Once they die, they are broken down by other organisms and microbes, and the minerals that had been taken in by those microbes then become available to plants, combined with both organic and amino acids. What are metabolites? Metabolites are molecular compounds that result from the life cycle of microorganisms. Metabolites play a role not only in agriculture and crop management but in human health and many other industries as well. One of the most recognized metabolites is penicillin. Other antibiotics are also metabolites of various bacteria and other microorganisms. Metabolites produced from bacteria during the fermentation process have a wide range of uses in nature. They are not just a byproduct created during the growth and development of the microbe; they can also have beneficial properties — like plant nutrient availability and aiding in disease management — that promote symbiotic relationships. There are two types of metabolites that are created by the microbes. First, primary metabolites are those that are essential for the plant’s growth and development. Primary metabolites Amino acids: The building blocks of protein molecules Enzymes: Developed from the microorganisms themselves, they act as catalysts for various reactions without losing their own properties and characteristics Vitamins: Essential micronutrients required by plants and animals to function Organic acids and alcohols: These products of primary metabolism are predominantly used in industries outside of agriculture and range in their uses, from flavorings to fermentation, as well as many others Secondary metabolites are more geared toward helping a plant respond to stressors, such as drought, salinity and pest pressure, and inducing the plant’s resistance to both biotic and abiotic stressors. Metabolites have also been found to be linked to the nutrient quality and availability of crops. Secondary metabolite properties Pest management: Some secondary metabolites have biopesticide properties that target specific pests and weeds while decreasing environmental risks Plant growth regulation: These metabolites act on differentiating plant cells and promoting or inhibiting plant growth as needed Induced resistance: Secondary metabolites push the plant to form a response mechanism to stressors so those stressors have a diluted effect on plant growth, vigor and productivity What are some of the beneficial microbes found in soil, and what do their metabolites do? There are a multitude of microbial species that can help plant growth and productivity, most of which are still unknown. Some examples of the beneficial bacteria and fungi that have already been discovered include: Bacillus subtilis: With more than 200,000 identified strains, this microbe family casts a wide net to fight against pathogens such as Fusarium, Pythium, Rhizoctonia and others. Bacillus licheniformis: This bacterium is excellent in its ability to break down especially tough proteins in plant residues, and research has found that it is also effective at nematode suppression and the synthesis of plant hormones. Bacillus thuringiensis: Metabolites from these bacteria have insecticidal properties. Lactobacillus plantarum: Various compounds, including lactic acid, create a hostile environment for competing microorganisms. Trichoderma harzianum: This fungus builds a mutually beneficial relationship with a plant’s roots and can help protect against pathogens such as Pythium and Fusarium. Trichoderma longibrachiatum: Research has found that not only does this fungal strain act as an antagonist against nematodes and other disease-causing fungi, but it may also have a positive influence on plant nutrient uptake and the production of plant hormones. Aspergillus spp.: Strains of this mold have been known to produce enzymes that break down plant fibers, which, in turn, improves the soil structure and amount of organic matter and helps release energy and nutrients the plant can use for improved performance and productivity. How is Alltech Crop Science harnessing the power of these microbes and metabolites? The Alltech Crop Science mission is to provide unique, reliable and sustainable biological solutions to combat everyday agronomic challenges that occur in the soil, in the environment and in the plant. Alltech Crop Science’s expertise in fermentation technology and research-backed initiatives go hand in hand to create solutions that build on the characteristics of the microbes and their metabolites, as well as taking into account the relationship between plants and their environment. “What sets Alltech Crop Science apart is our technology,” said Dr. Steven Borst, general manager of Alltech Crop Science. “Particularly, it is our ability to utilize fermentation media and metabolites to our advantage, and having an understanding of how to incorporate these technologies into management strategies.” Beginning in the soil rhizosphere, microbial diversity is constantly in a state of change, depending on variables such as soil characteristics and plant developmental stages. In turn, the types of metabolites that are being produced change as well. Being able to manage the changes and deficiencies caused by the changing conditions that influence metabolite production and sources is key to maintaining plant health. Many products on the market today tout the use of live microbials. Their claim is that the introduction of these live microbes will aid in soil and plant improvement and development. However, researchers have found that some products claiming to include live microbials sometimes have difficulties meeting their guarantees. “Microbes are notoriously difficult to keep alive, and even small changes in temperature, light and moisture levels can kill them during transport and storage,” said Borst. “When the grower uses the product, the live microbials that have survived face other dangers from other chemical applications and even other microbial products.” In using metabolites instead of live microbes, Alltech Crop Science products provide the benefits of microbes without facing the same challenges. If this is the case, should I refrain from using products with live microbial cultures? Not at all! Live microbial technologies have an important place in sustainable soil and crop management, and those that can maintain their guaranteed populations can be extremely beneficial for crops. As Alltech Crop Science continues to develop its own microbial line — and applies stringent quality procedures and testing to ensure our live population guarantees — we will provide growers with options that bring a more natural approach into the management process and promote sustainable and balanced solutions. Growers will see the same consistent results every time, whether they choose the Alltech Crop Science metabolite or live population products. Effectiveness is not diminished due to transport times or temperature differences between regions. The compatibility of Alltech Crop Science products with commonly used fertilizers, herbicides, fungicides and other products used on-farm also make them a reliable recommendation that meet their guarantees as well as grower expectations.

It can also serve as a platform to showcase the time and resources an industry has invested in their efforts to cultivate change. Pig producers, farming operations, businesses and academics alike understand that without a plan to future-proof pork production, the availability of a safe and sustainable food system will wane. What role can pig farmers play to make sure this doesn’t happen? The National Pork Board is continuing to set new sustainability goals to help ensure the future of pork production. Ashley McDonald, interim vice president of sustainability, shared more about those goals and how farmers can get on board during a virtual presentation at Alltech’s 2022 ONE Conference. U.S. pork is part of the solution The U.S. pork industry is working to establish itself as the sustainable protein, McDonald said. The industry’s sustainability success starts from the ground up and continues through production. The U.S. pork industry is only responsible for 0.4% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, according to the U.S. Pork Industry 2021 Sustainability Report, released by The National Pork Board1. Pork producers have worked steadily to become more environmentally friendly, reducing the industry’s carbon footprint by 7.7% over the last 50 years2, according to data from The National Pork Board and the University of Arkansas. With an extremely low impact on the environment due to the utilization of space and resources effectively, McDonald said this points directly towards a correlation effect of improved soil health. Being a steward of the land is important for pig producers, so the fact that these aspects go hand in hand only attributes further to the fact that sustainability is embedded in agriculture. U.S. pork producers utilize these avenues of successfully tending to their operations, efficiently using less physical land, water and feedstuffs, to provide a lean, quality, and affordable protein. Being diligent in the way that this protein is raised displays the importance of sustainable thinking and pig welfare. What is sustainability to the U.S. pork industry? As a leader in this space and a representative of many pork producers across the U.S., the National Pork Board has used its platform to amplify its “We Care Ethical Principles,” Which McDonald said are cornerstones of continuous growth: Food Safety Animal Well-being Public Health Environment Our People Our Community By creating space for advancement within the industry, the National Pork Board truly values McDonald’s shared idea of “doing what’s right for pigs, people, and the planet,” ideas which have not only remained on paper. Pork producers took action and found ways to make measurable improvements. By utilizing less land, less water and less energy, and emitting fewer carbon emissions, it is clear that the pork industry values sustainable pig farming and being good stewards of the environment. The National Pork Board’s ethics principles are implemented daily by pig farmers who truly believe in their solid guidance. Dale Stevermer, a pig farmer and industry representative, believes that “The We Care ethical principles I practice on my fifth-generation farm address the environmental impact of raising pigs. Documenting and measuring this impact is important to demonstrate my farm’s sustainability role to those who purchase, process and, ultimately, consume pork.” Actions following the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals “Pig farmers got together and decided that they really wanted to contribute to and develop goals and metrics that were truly credible and important to people not only here, but around the world,” McDonald said. The National Pork Board aided in facilitating this idea to establish goals and metrics that build credibility for the industry. Those within the space understand how important these topics are for production, but for them to be accepted by the greater public, a better line of communication was needed to share this exciting information. The National Pork Board commissioned Ernst & Young alongside the Pork Checkoff to launch a producer-led goal-setting process, including an assessment of key market drivers, a prioritization of social issues, an identification of ambition surrounding sustainability and a draft of specific goals. It was crucial that these goals and metrics were fully supported and existed alongside the set principles already established. Pork producers wanted to be known for being champions of this space at the global level, as well in our own backyard. The We Care Ethical Principles line up closely with 15 of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals set by the United Nations, showcasing the fact that producers here in the U.S. strive to prioritize similar concepts with those around the globe. A database for sustainability goals and metrics was launched to pull information for producers regarding their own operations in an On-Farm Sustainability Report, providing: Analysis regarding their work in conservation practices, Donations, Service hours, Manure utilization, and Environmental impact of their operation and other metrics. This creates a U.S. Pork Industry Sustainability Report to help answer questions about pork production and producers’ sustainability commitment. Understanding the true significance of this reporting system is crucial. “The real power of the Your-Farm Sustainability Reports is the ability to aggregate the data and show the climate-positive impacts of using swine manure to raise crops,” Stevermer said. “Third-party verification through SEC (Sustainable Environmental Consultants) also supports the industry’s aspiration to produce the leading sustainable protein. Using sound data will guide pork producers as we set benchmarks and create improvement goals that will change the narrative around animal production.” By acknowledging how imperative it is to pork producers that things are done the right way, pig farmers are raising the bar for animal agriculture in this space. A commitment to doing what is right Sharing the sustainability work being done in the industry allows pork producers to continue to shine the light on its commitment to people, pigs and the planet. Pork producers must continue to drive conversations and engagement using the real, on-farm data made available through the On-Farm Sustainability Report, McDonald said. Reporting progress and quantifying the substantial, continual progress toward sustainability displays how much pork producers want to improve the world we live in.

Nitrogen is one of the top three essential plant nutrients for crop growth, along with potassium and phosphorus. It is responsible for photosynthesis and chlorophyll concentration, which supplies the green color to plants, allowing farmers to monitor crop health more quickly and easily. Vibrant deep green indicates healthy plants with a lot of chlorophyll. Yellowing (chlorosis) and light green, however, show a lack of chlorophyll and plant health issues, potentially due to a lack of nitrogen. Our atmosphere is abundant in nitrogen — 79% of nitrogen is in the form of N2 gas. Nonetheless, this is unavailable to crops unless it is “fixed” (combined) in the form of ammonium (NH4) or nitrate (NO) ions to be used for plant development. In this sense, nitrogen is often a limiting factor for optimal crop growth, even under ideal climate and water supply conditions. Overuse of synthetic nitrogen Fertilizers are essential for the production of food worldwide. The invention of synthetic nitrogen at the turn of the 20th century changed how we dealt with the availability of nitrogen in soil — we no longer had to rely on the limited amount of nitrogen found naturally in soils across the world but could produce and feed it to plants. Therefore, fertilizers allow us to obtain better agricultural yields with a favorable overall impact: farmers profitably produce more on less land. But there are some severe drawbacks. In theory, utilizing more fertilizer would not necessarily be problematic if the crops used all that was supplied. However, when we look at the ratio of nitrogen in harvested crops compared to nitrogen inputs (through fertilizers or manure), we can clearly see an unbalanced output. Our crops take up less than half of the nitrogen we apply. Let us take a step back and explore what this data means. The comparison between nitrogen input and output is called “nitrogen use efficiency” (NUE). The higher this number is, the better the plants are uptaking and utilizing the nutrient provided. An NUE of 80% means that the quantity of nitrogen in crops equals 80% of the nitrogen supplied as inputs, with the plants not utilizing the remaining 20% of nitrogen. A low NUE is undesirable, as it means that very little of the nitrogen applied gets absorbed by crops, and the rest becomes a pollutant. Since 1980, global NUE has remained at a low level of 40-50%. The remaining nitrogen is waste that seeps into the natural environment, flowing off the soils and polluting rivers and lakes, disturbing ecosystems and causing biodiversity loss. Consequences of a low NUE include: Groundwater pollution: Nitrates lost outside the root zone pollute groundwater. Eutrophication: Harmful algal growth that depletes oxygen and harms aquatic organisms. Nitrogen deposition: Ammonia released into the air through volatilization comes back to the surface as sulfur dioxide gas. Greenhouse effect: Nitrous oxide formed through denitrification is responsible for 5% global climatic change (Shoji et al., 2001). The lack of uptake leads to the need to apply more and more nitrogen fertilizers to continue growing crops at an increasing rate to feed the ever-growing population. Farmers boost nitrogen application, prolonging the cycle while further depleting the soil and raising crop costs. This regular application increase means that it now takes significantly higher doses of nitrogen to produce the same amount of crops as in the 1960s. Soil and plant nitrogen losses harm the ecosystem, soil fertility and plant production. Ammonia emissions cause acid rain and nitrous oxide emissions. Eutrophication — when nitrate leaches into aquifers and promotes an overgrowth of aquatic plants and algae — threatens fish populations, water quality, and human and animal health. Overuse of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers has generated over 500 dead zones at a global level. As a result of nitrate leaching regulations, agricultural land usage has been restricted in several nations. Increasing yields require increased inputs, which in turn increase pollution. We seem to be closed in this continuous cycle, where many people think that additional fertilizer use for crop yields is an unquestionable trade-off. Yet, we are not limited to this compromise, and microorganisms play a key role in the emerging solution. Soil nitrogen-fixing bacteria and nitrogen cycle Bacteria are the only known microorganisms capable of converting nitrogen gas into the plant-available organic compound ammonia. Before commercial nitrogen fixation methods were developed, plants relied only on microorganisms to provide useable nitrogen. Soil bacteria play a crucial role in practically all elements of nitrogen availability, supporting the formation and growth of both underground ecosystems and plants through: Conversion of N2 into ammonia through nitrogen fixation. These bacteria are either free-living (they live independently of other organisms) or form symbiotic associations with plants or other organisms (e.g., termites, protozoa). Transformation of ammonia to nitrate and of nitrate to N2 or other nitrogen gases. Degradation of organic matter, releasing fixed nitrogen for reuse by other organisms. Soil bacteria are responsible for the major conversion of N2 into ammonia and subsequently into proteins in the process called nitrogen fixation (or dinitrogen fixation). Nitrogen fixation is the process of converting relatively non-reactive atmospheric N2 into more reactive molecules (nitrates, nitrites or ammonia). These reactive forms are essential for crops, helping them thrive. Nitrogen shortage, on the other hand, stunts crop growth and healthy development. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria, such as Rhizobium, Azospirillum or Rhodobacter, manufacture a unique enzyme responsible for nitrogen fixation, which accounts for about 90% of natural nitrogen fixation on our planet. In short, nitrogen-fixing bacteria transform atmospheric nitrogen into inorganic chemicals. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria accomplish what crops cannot themselves: they get assimilative nitrogen. Bacteria absorb it as a gas from the air and release it to the soil, typically as ammonia. It is the only viable alternative for plants since they can only ingest nitrogen from the soil as nitrogenous inorganic molecules, emphasizing the need for nitrogen fixation. This ready-to-use nitrogen that bacteria provide to the crops is a much-needed component of chlorophyll molecules. Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis, which converts sunlight energy into the chemical energy that plants need. Furthermore, plants need nitrogen as a component of amino acids in order to construct proteins that function in metabolism and energy storage. A lack of nitrogen fixation causes yellowing, thinning, withering, general growth delay and decay. Nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria ultimately provide the ground with inorganic nitrogen-containing compounds that are essential crop nutrients. Upon their death, these nitrogen-fixing bacteria release the nitrogen stored in their biomass into the soil, naturally increasing soil fertility and enabling farmers to save money on synthetic fertilizers. “Nitrogen bacteria teach us that nature, with her sophisticated forms of the chemistry of living matter, still understands and utilizes methods, which we do not as yet know how to imitate.” Fritz Haber, Nobel Lectures, Chemistry 1901-1921, The Synthesis of Ammonia from Its Elements Biofertilization supports sustainable crop production Plants benefit from biofertilization because it encourages the use of inputs containing a range of microorganisms capable of populating the rhizosphere and making nutrients more easily accessible to plant root hairs through bioavailability. Including, but not limited to, symbiotic and free-living nitrogen-fixers, biofertilizers are cost-effective and environmentally sustainable, aside from being effective alternatives to synthetic fertilizers. Biofertilizers can help sustain agricultural productivity and fulfil the rising demand for crop products while conserving and preserving natural resources for future generations. Numerous studies throughout the world demonstrate the value of biofertilizers in boosting crop yields and improving the quality of agricultural products by: Enhancing soil content with nutrients and useful microorganisms. Promoting soil fertility and health. Preserving natural resources. Improving productivity and cost-benefit ratios to achieve better agricultural sustainability. Alltech Crop Science, a global leader in microbial fermentation and the utilization of their metabolites, continues to research and innovate to assist farmers worldwide in moving toward more sustainable, productive and profitable crop production.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/biofertilization-increased-soil-nitrogen-availability","title":"\n\n                    Biofertilization: Increased soil nitrogen availability\n                    ","date":"August 16, 2022","contentLength":1326}},{"pageContent":"While swine productivity and efficiency continue to increase, gases and odors from livestock operations persist and have become a severe problem, with social implications for many countries. Swine facilities are intrinsically associated with air pollutants and the emission of gases, such as ammonia (NH3), hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases often have a negative impact on air quality, animal health and quality of life within and beyond these facilities. Among these gases, ammonia is one of the most widely recognized because of both its prevalence and distinctive effects on animal well-being and pork production but also for its impact on the environment. Ammonia emission is a natural process produced by the anaerobic decomposition of animal waste; however, chronic exposure can lead to health problems and could subsequently affect animal performance, especially in a confined environment. Research published by Koerkamp et al. (1998) suggested that emissions of NH3 from sows and wean and finishing pigs ranged from 22 to 1,298 mg/h/animal. Additionally, environmental ammonia ranged from 5 to 30 ppm in swine confinements. While highly variable, concentrations over 20 ppm of NH3 can adversely impact the health of both workers and animals. Where does ammonia come from? Ammonia is released from the urea present in urine through the activity of waste-degrading microbes. Urea is formed by the kidneys and is utilized by the body to excrete nitrogen, which is essential for normal health. Several management factors can contribute to poor indoor air quality and, subsequently, higher concentrations of ammonia, including damp bedding, lack of ventilation and nutritional factors, like overfeeding protein. How does ammonia affect pigs? Ammonia is a toxic gas that, when present in high concentrations, can easily become a chronic problem in the barn. Other documented effects associated with ammonia include tail-biting and respiratory diseases in pigs, but it can also lead to severe problems in human caretakers and can be detrimental for the environment. Research conducted by Andreasin et al. (1994) suggested that even minimal exposure to ammonia can be harmful. For example, swine exposed to 50 ppm of ammonia for 20 minutes a day on just four occasions experienced reduced performance and decreased live bodyweight gain (between 37 and 90 kg) (Fig. 1) In addition, ammonia can seriously affect respiratory health and delay puberty, even at the low level of 20 ppm (Malayer et al. 1980). Figure 1. Impact of ammonia concentration in swine performance (adapted from Andreasin et al. 1994. IPVS Proc.). How does ammonia contribute to pollution? Ammonia is the major alkaline component of the Earth’s atmosphere and can be found in water, soil and air. Ammonia impacts the environment through several different mechanisms, including by influencing air quality, odor, eutrophication, acidification and direct toxicity and also via indirect effects. Ammonia pollution has a major impact on biodiversity, with nitrogen accumulation affecting the diversity and composition of plant species within affected habitats. Additionally, atmospheric nitrogen deposition has induced adverse effects in forest systems and eutrophication in several estuarine and coastal ecosystems. How to reduce ammonia emissions in pig barns A holistic approach is needed to improve indoor air quality in swine barns, from checking ventilation to providing the proper equipment to implementing nutritional strategies and manure management. Here are three areas to focus on for improving ventilation and reducing poor indoor air quality: Determine that all fans are in working order. Clean fan blades and louvers and ensure that the fan motor and thermostat are in the proper condition. Check that the curtains close securely, that debris and/or equipment are cleaned up and put away before snowfall, and that the propane tanks are examined for leaks. Check air inlets and temperatures and test the supplemental heat sources inside of your buildings. Additionally, many pork producers and animal feeding operations also utilize nutritional strategies and technologies in their feed, such as reducing the amount of crude protein or including Yucca schidigera (YS) plant extract in the diet, which can be used as an additive to consistently reduce adverse gas and odor emissions and decrease ammonia concentrations. Peer-reviewed data has shown that YS can reduce aerial ammonia levels by up to 50%. Formulated from proprietary extracts of YS, De-Odorase® is a safe way to reduce and maintain low ammonia levels in pig barns. The evaluation of using De-Odorase® in swine housing units to control ammonia began in the early 1990s. Tuck (1991) reported that including De-Odorase® at 120 g per metric ton of finished feed reduced atmospheric ammonia by 50% and 65% during the weaning and growing phases, respectively, representing nearly one-third of the initial level. Colina et al. (2001) reported a reduction of 35% in aerial ammonia in nursery swine units after four weeks of dietary supplementation with De-Odorase (Fig. 2) A summary of peer-reviewed research supports the benefits of utilizing De-Odorase®, including: Decreased gases and odors (Ender et al., 1993; Vucemilo et al., 2004). Sustained pig respiratory system function (Monteiro et al., 2010; Vucemilo et al., 2004). Improved animal performance (Gombos, 1991; Ender et al., 1993; Power and Tuck, 1995; Panetta et al., 2006). Better working conditions for stockmen (Cole et al., 1998). Figure 2. Aerial ammonia in nursery swine determined by aspiration tubes (Adapted from Colina et al., 2001. J. Anim. Sci.) Controlling ammonia gas in pig production creates a healthier environment not only for the animal, but also for the producer.

Two Horse Ranch, a five-acre horse property in the busy Seattle suburb of Redmond, Washington — home of Microsoft, Nintendo and 65,000 residents — has implemented several sustainable day-to-day barn management practices in an effort to be a more environmentally conscious horse farm. On farms with small acreage, everything in the horse farm management system needs to fit together neatly and efficiently — especially with respect to the farm’s neighbors and the ecosystem. Join us on this horse property tour as we look at the land management practices these horse owners are using to reduce mud, manage manure, increase pasture productivity and operate in a way that makes their farm as horse-healthy and eco-friendly as possible. 1. Streamside riparian area. Two Horse Ranch is located on the salmon-spawning stream of Bear Creek. As a result, landowners Rita and Mark Hampson have chosen not to use herbicides or pesticides; chemical runoff, as well as runoff from mismanaged manure piles or muddy paddocks, can adversely affect water quality as well as plant and animal life in the corridor along the stream, called a “riparian area.” Instead, Two Horse Ranch is carefully managed to keep horses well away from the stream banks. Additionally, native trees and shrubs — nature's biocontrol for filtering out dirty runoff — have been planted all along the stream corridor. Vegetation also helps prevent soil erosion and provides food and shelter for fish and other aquatic life. The overhead canopy of trees and tall shrubs shades the water, keeping it cool in the summer, which fish like. Large, woody debris in the stream slows the current, provides habitat diversity and shelters aquatic creatures. These landowners enjoy looking at the beautiful native plants along the water, as well as beavers, river otters, eagles, ospreys, cormorants, herons, mergansers, the occasional deer, bobcats, bears and, of course, rabbits. The center-stage stars of the show are the wild salmon, which return in the fall and migrate upstream to spawn. 2. Paddocks. Using a confinement area as the horses’ outdoor living quarters keeps horses from over-using and subsequently destroying pastures. Paddocks can be designed to be mud-free and still contain “enrichment,” or stimulating opportunities for these highly intelligent animals, helping them avoid getting bored or developing bad habits like wood-chewing or pacing. Rita and Mark have designed large, mud-free dry-lots for their horses that are situated on a portion of their property with well-draining soils. Removing manure daily reduces the potential for mud, and they also use gravel footing (5/8-inch crushed rock mixed with pea gravel) in high-traffic areas to prevent erosion and mud build-up. Occasionally, they also add a pile of sand for the horses to roll and play in as well. They have re-shaped the slope slightly to allow for improved drainage and to reduce the likelihood of water pooling. Surface water runoff is directed toward grassy areas, which provide biofiltration for any potential sediment or nutrients (from manure or urine) so that dirty runoff never reaches Bear Creek. 3. Protecting drinking water. Like many rural landowners, the Hampsons have their own well and septic system. They know that taking care of both systems saves them money in the long run, and it’s also important for water quality, as a failed septic system can cause waste to leak into the groundwater or streams like Bear Creek. Their septic system is located well away from confinement areas and from the creek. The well head for this property is protected with a small well house (pictured here) and is located about 25 feet from the paddock. Daily manure pick-up and efficient drainage of the paddock are essential to protecting the well. Ideally, the well head would be further away from any livestock activity, but small-acreage horse farm owners must often work within their unique constraints to puzzle things together as best possible. 4. Tree buffers. Along the perimeter of the paddock are native trees, fenced off from the horses, that act as a visual buffer for neighbors (to the right) and as a shelter for birds and small wildlife. Native plants work best for wildlife habitats, as they have evolved over thousands of years in a particular region to provide habitat for a variety of native wildlife species, such as songbirds and butterflies. 5. Shelters. These individual 14’ x 14’ shelters were designed to provide horses with protection from extreme weather conditions while still offering excellent ventilation and a clean, dry place to feed. The floors are made of rubber stall mats placed over six inches of packed, level gravel. The shelters’ openness allows the horses to see each other and feel comfortable despite being further apart. 6. Chore efficiency. Keeping the proper tools of the trade on hand is important on any horse property — especially on those with small acreage. Keep chore time equipment stored in a handy spot that offers some weather protection. A pass-through provides quick access into and out of paddocks for chores or feeding. 7. Mud control. Both of the shelters on this farm have rain gutters and downspouts, which drain into a simple underground drain field. Diverting this water away from the horses’ living areas reduces mud, helps keep the rainwater clean and recharges the ground water. 8. Urine management. Odor control is accomplished with help from a “potty spot” of wood chips. For horses that tend to urinate in the same location, wood chips made from woods like cedar or fir — evergreens resist decomposition longer than deciduous trees; be sure to choose something nontoxic — bind with the nitrogen in the urine to help reduce odors. Once a year, the Hampsons refresh this area with more chips, and the old chips are composted. 9. Daily manure management. Manure management is done in yard-waste composting barrels, a type of barrel that is often used for small-scale backyard composting. Eight barrels are used for the two horses, with each barrel holding about four days’ worth of manure. Manure “cooks” in the barrels, generating heat of up to 160 degrees, for about eight days. The temperature slowly drops to about 60 degrees over the course of a few weeks. When more space is needed, the oldest barrel contents are cleared out and stockpiled under tarps to “cure.” The finished compost is spread during the growing season. Compost is a rich soil amendment that improves the productivity of pastures, making grasses healthier and better able to hold moisture. Covering compost piles and/or manure storage areas helps prevent rainwater from leaching nitrogen from the manure or compost and seeping into waterways. 10. Outdoor wash rack. This three-season outdoor wash rack features a geo-grid product as its base to stabilize the gravel footing, allow for better drainage and reduce mud. Three inches of 5/8-inch crushed rock is used under the geo-grid and two inches of pea gravel is placed on top of the grid for better footing. Horses are tied to one of the posts for bath time or to tack up. 11. Pasture. Approximately two acres of pasture are managed via rotational grazing and are only used during the growing season (i.e., from late spring through the fall). To prevent overgrazing and compaction, grasses are never grazed below around three to four inches and horses are never put on soggy soils. A minimum of three inches of leafy grass is needed for rapid regrowth and the biofiltration of nutrients, sediments and chemicals. During the growing season, the Hampsons’ two horses get 25–30% of their feed from the pasture, grazing two to three hours per day. As grass growth slows in the late fall, pasture time doesn't provide a lot of nutrition but is great for giving horses time to just \"be horses,” which is imperative for maintaining their health. Improved horse pasture production decreases feed bills — and may even help you avoid vet bills, since there’s little room for toxic weeds in a healthy pasture. 12. Spreading compost. A small, ground-driven manure spreader is used to spread compost during the growing season, from late spring through early fall. Composting manure reduces parasite re-infestation, as well as flies, weeds and odors — and it serves as a free, easy and valuable soil amendment. During the growing season, composted manure is often spread directly from the composting bins, thereby minimizing any handling and storage requirements. 13. Equipment. A variety of small farm equipment makes land management possible on small acreage, including a pasture mower used with a tractor and PTO (power takeoff), a walk-behind string mower for trimming edges or mowing slopes, and a tine harrow for dragging arenas or spreading manure in pastures. 14. Arena. When the Hampsons can’t get out on the trails due to inclement weather or time constraints, this 70’ x 110’ arena is useful for riding or just to exercise their horses. This arena was constructed on a base of native soil mixed with an inexpensive sand/gravel pit-run material that was leveled and compacted.

He reminisced about the 2019 event at which he stood on the main stage to announce Working Together for a Planet of Plenty™, a new idea that would soon become the organization's overarching vision. Lyons admitted that the concept was not the easiest for people to grasp at the time. However, it was a perspective that was deeply rooted in the DNA of Alltech. It was directly connected to and expanded on Dr. Pearse Lyons’ original ACE principle; the belief that it was agriculture’s duty to care for the animal, consumer and environment. Similarly, when this idea was introduced in the 1980s, many people were also slow to get on board. However, focusing on the present day, Lyons said that the time of the ACE principle and a Planet of Plenty has truly come. He stated that consumers, especially the younger generation, are thinking about food differently, and agriculture must respond to their needs. To achieve this, however, he explained that we might require a shift in approach. “Reducing is not enough; we have to do something different,” Lyons said. “Our belief is that agriculture has the greatest positive potential to influence the future of our planet that can provide nutrition for all and help rural communities to thrive and replenish our planet’s resources.” Carbon sequestration One of the ways that agriculture can have a major impact on restoring and conserving the environment is through carbon sequestration. Lyons welcomed Dr. Vaughn Holder, Alltech ruminant research group director, to the stage to further explore this concept and how it could be implemented within the industry. Holder began this discussion by looking at data on greenhouse gas emissions and their impact on our planet. What was clear to see from these graphs was that CO2 is the primary contributor to global warming. However, Holder believes that agriculture could do a lot to solve this issue and showed that Alltech is already working to help farmers address it. He introduced the audience to an Alltech research alliance called Archbold Expeditions. Based at the 10,000-acre Buck Island Ranch station in Lake Placid, Florida, this research monitors land, nutrient and pollution inputs and outputs to evaluate experimental methodologies and modeling techniques for estimating carbon and nutrient fluxes on working cattle operations. Holder explained that Buck Island Ranch production data analysis documented emissions from its 3,000-head cattle operation of 10,884 metric tons of CO2e/year, with enteric fermentation responsible for 64%. However, estimates of sequestration by Bahia grass pasture suggest that Buck Island Ranch pastures take up 17,813 metric tons of CO2e/year, resulting in a net sequestration of 6,929 metric tons of CO2e/year. So, what does this mean for farmers? Holder revealed that the data shows us that by implementing pasture management practices, agriculture is in a unique position where it can both provide the food resources that the world population needs while at the same time engaging in actions that will help conserve and restore the planet. In fact, he stated that by focusing on feed and growth efficiency strategies and carbon sequestration management strategies on grazed lands, we could reduce greenhouse gases by over 50%. “Our ability to manipulate it is going to become more important,” Holder explained. “No one else is positioned in the way that we are to do this.” When asked what the next step is for making this a reality, Holder said we first need to create a mindset shift. He explained that a scalable model of how to approach this must be developed so that farmers can focus on food production and the environment simultaneously. Only then can we preserve the future of the planet. Nutrition for all Echoing Holder’s message of the importance of conserving the world in which we live, Nikki Putnam Badding, managing director and chief dietitian of Acutia, focused on expanding this theme to the world population. “Sustainability does not begin and end with environmental impact,” Putnam Badding explained. “It actually means that we are taking care of the health of the planet and the people who share it.” Putnam Badding presented the ONE attendees with the troubling figures that 1 in 10 people is undernourished, while 1 in 4 is malnourished. This issue can have severe health repercussions, such as pregnancy complications, heart problems and cognitive function. There are also further-reaching consequences, such as slow economic growth, poverty and reduced numbers of children receiving education. “So, is it enough to just feed the world?” Putnam Badding asked. “Do we need to provide nutrition for all and change the dialogue from food security to nutrition security?” Putnam Badding believes that agriculture has the opportunity to be the world's hero in this situation, as societal health starts in the soil. She explained that people have known that soil health and human health are intrinsically connected throughout history. This is also backed by numerous case studies showing that bringing deficient nutrients back to the soil can rectify many human health issues. However, once we bring the nutrients back to the soil, Putnam Badding says we need to focus on the best way of getting the nutrients to the people. This is where animals come in. “Livestock is nature’s original upcyclers,” Putnam Badding stated. “They take plant stuffs that our bodies cannot do anything with and create highly bioavailable, nutrient-dense, protein-packed meat, dairy and eggs.” She also revealed that enriching products with nutrients not only benefits human health but the commercial aspects of agriculture too. Studies show that 48% of consumers are willing to pay more for healthier food, while 72% believe that businesses need to play a bigger role in the availability and access to healthy food. “We must remember that soil, plants, animal, environmental and human health are all deeply interrelated, and our purpose is more than farming,” Putnam Badding concluded. “It’s more than food production; it’s more than the reduction of environmental impact. It is sustaining the life and health of the planet and the lives and health of the people who share it.” For additional on-demand content and more from the Alltech ONE Conference, visit one.alltech.com.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/agricultures-role-saving-planet","title":"\n\n                    Agriculture’s role in saving the planet\n                    ","date":"May 23, 2022","contentLength":1056}},{"pageContent":"In the dairy industry, successfully implementing solutions that “kill two birds with one stone” requires innovation and usable data. Finding ways to reduce the carbon footprint on dairy cattle operations while also maintaining high milk production is just that kind of situation. It is important to understand that dairy production is on a continuous path of growth. Some insightful data provided by the IFCN shows that global milk production is projected to increase by 35% between 2017 and 2030. This level of growth is promising for the industry but will also present many challenges and raise questions about our ability to provide more with fewer resources while adopting practices that are environmentally sound. To top everything off, all of this must be achieved while also continuing to increase transparency for consumers about how their milk is produced. The main question is: Can we reduce the carbon footprint of milk while also improving our production and profitability? Greenhouse gases have been a trending topic among consumers for several years, and this topic is now resonating more with dairy farmers across the world, as new regulations and initiatives are being presented. To achieve reduced emissions, we must look at ways to optimize production — including via nutritional solutions, which will play a very big role as we go forward. Dairy producers can utilize nutritional solutions as tools for reducing methane emissions from dairy cows, but technologies that offer environmental benefits cannot compromise on animal performance, as doing so would mean requiring more animals to meet the growing demand for food. However, before looking to implement any of these solutions, dairy producers will need to measure their carbon footprint. TOOL ONE: Alltech E-CO2 To successfully reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, we must first know where these emissions come from. Analytical services, such as Alltech E-CO2, identify and quantify these hotspots through accredited environmental assessments. Over the past 10 years and more than 10,000 assessments, Alltech E-CO2 has found that the two largest sources of emissions on dairy farms are enteric emissions (i.e., methane from the rumen) and feed use. Together, these two sources contribute more than 60% of all emissions on dairy operations. These sources relate to rumen health and an animal’s ability to best maximize the feed it is being fed. By ensuring the production of a healthy and productive cow, we are helping operations improve their production efficiency while also enabling energy to be utilized for milk production and regular body maintenance, rather than being wasted by fighting health challenges. This type of information is critical for identifying targeted solutions that will enhance our methane mitigation strategies. To successfully reduce a farm’s carbon footprint, we must look beyond one gas in one area and consider the balance of emissions across the entire farm. A lifecycle observation is one way of doing that, and it’s all about identifying opportunities to reduce waste and improve farm efficiency, which will translate to more money for the producer. Learn more about Alltech E-CO2 here. Read on to learn more about two nutritional solutions that work to target the areas where there is room for improvement, as identified by Alltech E-CO2. TOOL TWO: Optigen® Optigen is a feed ingredient backed by years of robust research data that works to support production efficiency and sustainability. Optigen, a concentrated source of non-protein nitrogen, releases nitrogen into the rumen in a slow-release form. This provides a sustained release of ammonia in the rumen in sync with fermented carbohydrate digestion, thus allowing for efficient microbial protein synthesis in the rumen. In order to gather clear evidence that shows how we can use feed strategies to reduce our carbon footprint, the FAO developed a standard guideline for the environmental performance of feed additives in the livestock supply chain. These standards recommend the use of data from meta-analyses and life cycle analyses. Meta-analyses make it possible to combine data from years of multiple studies to arrive at an evidence-based conclusion by using comprehensive statistical procedures. Life-cycle analyses allow us to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions along the entire supply chain or in the production cycle of a particular product. Combining these two approaches demonstrates how feeding technologies can contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and/or better sustainability credentials. Included here is an example of a meta-analysis of Optigen. The data from this meta-analysis indicate that, over the course of around two decades, research has shown that using Optigen is associated with a 23% reduction, on average, of plant protein sources in the diet. Soybean meal, specifically, can be reduced by about 21%, and an increase in feed efficiency of around 3% has also been documented. Additionally, diets that include Optigen and use reduced amounts of plant protein sources have been shown to improve nitrogen utilization efficiency by 4%, leading to a 14% reduction in the total carbon footprint of the diets of animals used in milk production. Read the full meta-analysis here. TOOL 3: Yea-Sacc® There are some products on the market — like yeast cultures — that can help improve production efficiency while also reducing the carbon footprint of an operation. Yea-Sacc is a yeast culture based on the Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain of yeast. Yea-Sacc modifies rumen activity by supporting a consistent improvement in the growth and activity of lactic acid-utilizing bacteria, which helps stabilize the rumen pH. At the same time, it also works to improve the digestion and utilization of nutrients. Thanks to these types of improvements, cows can absorb more nutrients for higher milk production. Utilizing a meta-analysis approach once again, a collection of 31 studies has shown that feeding Yea-Sacc to dairy cows can lead to an increased milk yield of 1 kg/head/day, on average, and can reduce the carbon footprint and nitrogen emission intensity by around 3% and 5.4%, respectively. These numbers demonstrate that it is possible for milk production efficiency to increase and for the carbon footprint and nitrogen excretion intensity to decrease simultaneously. Explore the additional benefits of Yea-Sacc here. At the beginning of this blog, we posed a question: Can we reduce the carbon footprint of milk while also improving our production and profitability? With proven tools like the ones outlined here, the answer to that question is yes: It is possible to reduce the carbon footprint of dairy production and to improve our economic returns and performance at the same time. Based on the data compiled in various meta-analyses, it is clear that there are feeding solutions on the market that farmers can use to reduce their emissions and increase their productivity and profitability in conjunction with nutritional strategies that will help improve production efficiency in dairy systems.

Grain markets rallied through the end of last year, and due to the poor availability of supplies globally, prices are continuing to skyrocket. This is happening against a backdrop of a macro-environment impacted by a weakening U.S. dollar and China ramping up its soybean imports. Considering these factors, how do we address the key challenges of mitigating risk and remaining financially and environmentally sustainable while optimizing cattle performance? Overcoming the protein challenge To sustain profitability, dairy and beef producers need to examine their feed management and nutritional applications. By using good-quality forage, supporting rumen health and using a tailored ration formulation, producers can cut back on their losses and keep their operations running more efficiently — thereby resulting in potential cost savings. This organizational agility is of paramount importance to overcoming the protein challenge. Forage quality With the continual rise of corn and soybean prices, producers should make the most of cheaper high-fiber feeds, especially forages. Plan to make the highest-quality forage possible, since this is a major component of the slowly digestible part of ruminant diets. Forage is the most variable feed ingredient in terms of its digestibility and nutrient composition, and it comprises a greater proportion of the ration than any other feedstuff. High-quality forage is more digestible, so you will be able to feed more of it. Rumen health and productivity will improve with the use of high-quality forages, and as such, forages can influence feed efficiency in dairy and beef cattle through the maintenance of a desirable rumen environment. Support the rumen There are several elements to increasing feed efficiency in ruminants, but one of the most important is to use the rumen to its full potential by supporting the activity and growth of rumen microflora. This enables dietary nutrients to be extracted from the diet as efficiently as possible. The nutrients provided to the rumen microflora must be well-balanced in terms of their fermentable energy and protein supply. Fermentable protein nutrition must be specifically adapted to maximize rumen microbial population activity and growth, as different populations have different requirements in term of how nitrogen is supplied. Wasted energy means wasted profits For years, nutritionists have overfed crude protein to meet the amino acid requirements for their desired milk yield or daily liveweight gains. Besides the significant increase in input costs, this also results in poor nitrogen efficiency and, subsequently, higher nitrogen excretion, which is detrimental to both the environment and the producer’s profits. The dairy cow inherently suffers as a result of poor nitrogen efficiency, since excessive nitrogen is converted first into ammonia and then into urea — which is partially recycled, but the vast majority is excreted. Ultimately, there is an energy loss associated with this process due to the detoxification of ammonia into urea. This energy cost comes at the expense of productivity and biological functions. The energy required to excrete excess nitrogen in a dairy cow is equivalent to up to 2 kg (4.4 lbs.) of milk and can lead to: Body condition loss Increased blood and milk urea levels Issues with reproductive performance Lower protein doesn’t have to mean lower performance With the tightening of global protein supplies, producers may face a shortage later this year and will need to stretch their existing stocks. But what if lower-protein diets could be fed while still maintaining performance? The possibility to increase nitrogen efficiency using Optigen®, a non-protein nitrogen technology from Alltech®, pushes the boundaries of protein nutrition. Nitrogen from Optigen is more efficiently captured by rumen bacteria and is transformed into additional microbial biomass — so, why couldn’t the total dietary nitrogen supply be reduced? Researchers from Penn State University1 have looked at dairy cattle ration formulation and decreasing the crude protein supply from 16.5% to 15.5% while increasing the forage quantity fed to cows through the introduction of Optigen. In this study, Optigen partially replaced heat-treated soybean meal and canola meal. This resulted in: Better nitrogen efficiency (from 28.8% to 30.8%, respectively, in the control and Optigen groups) Greater milk production in the Optigen group (41.6 vs. 40.5 kg/day) This resulted in an elevated income over feed cost of $0.16/cow/day. When it comes to beef cattle feed rations, a recent meta-analysis2 highlighted how the partial replacement of vegetable protein with Optigen exhibited a consistent improvement in the liveweight gain and feed efficiency of beef cattle. The many positive effects included an average higher liveweight gain (by 8%) and better feed efficiency (by 8%), with the inclusion of corn silage enhancing the effects of Optigen. A simulation analysis based on these benefits indicated that feeding Optigen to gain 440 lbs. in 1,000 cattle would: Reduce the time to slaughter by 9 days Reduce feed costs by $18,000 Support a reduction in the carbon footprint of the beef unit by 111 tons of CO2 equivalents These studies clearly demonstrate how innovations like Optigen can make improved animal performance, reduced environmental impact and financial gains not only possible but compatible. Optigen delivers consistency when you need it most In a world of quickly evolving change and disruption, consistency can seem idealistic. However, for a high-producing dairy cow or feedlot animal, consistency in how we feed and manage them is crucial for them to reach their optimal performance and profitability. At Alltech, we have identified “the 7 Ps of consistency” that we associate with Optigen. Over the last 15 years, these “Ps” have evolved, and several of them have been reinforced during the global pandemic — for example, the importance of securing a robust supply chain for proteins and the ability to continue supplying producers and feed companies around the world in the face of adverse conditions. There was also a question: Would Covid-19 diminish the sense of urgency around climate-friendly food production? Recent policy announcements around the world reiterated the point that food systems cannot be resilient to crises such as the current global pandemic if they are not sustainable. With radical increases in vegetable protein costs, global attention will focus on the inherent nutrient variability between consignment and place of origin. Optigen is a solution that provides consistency when we need it most — from helping producers reduce their reliance on protein sources that fluctuate in price or that simply aren’t in supply to ensuring consistent animal performance and overall production profitability. In summary, there are ways to lower feed costs and sustain the profitability of your dairy or beef enterprise during the current protein challenge and beyond. Here are six tips to help you: Increasing prices and demand for proteins mean that close attention should be paid to the nutritional composition of vegetable protein stocks, which could vary in their consignment and place of origin and, as a result, put animal performance at risk. Make the most of cheaper high-fiber feeds, especially forages, but ensure that those forages are high-quality. Support the rumen and ensure that it is being used to its full potential. This will enable nutrients to be extracted from the diet as efficiently as possible. Consider feeding balanced, lower-protein diets to stretch your protein supplies, which may be necessary in case of a shortage later this year. Include Optigen in your dairy and beef cattle rations as a nutritional solution for lowering your dietary protein while increasing efficiency. The partial replacement of bulky vegetable protein sources with Optigen, a concentrated nitrogen source, also creates more space in the diet to increase the inclusion of cheaper home-grown forages. Take this opportunity to look at how environmentally friendly the feedstuffs you use are, as protein sources can carry a high carbon burden if they are not sourced from responsible production, ultimately impacting the long-term sustainability of the operation.

Few have weathered the storms quite like LEGO. They have answered the challenges of innovation and have simultaneously held to the simple toy that has always made them LEGO. Over the past decade, LEGO has soared within the toy industry, rising to become 2015’s most powerful brand in the world, according to global consultancy firm Brand Finance. One has to wonder how a company born out of children’s play habits from sixty years ago still thrives in this new age. Can a brand be reinvented? Marketing expert, Dr. Damien McLoughlin, will address this very question as he presents his talk, Rebel and Rebuild, during Alltech REBELation. So in anticipation of the full story to come during REBELation, here are 5 Lessons from LEGO’s Story. The key to staying relevant, as is expected in business, is the customer. Any business can identify their target market. The value is in truly knowing the customer: their tastes, their time, their media influences. LEGO knows as much or more about children’s play than any company in the world. Both knowing your customer and identifying the most relevant version of your business are products of research. In the 10 years that LEGO has grown into a toy manufacturing superpower, they have paralleled that growth with research expenditures. Mistakes are the evidence of experimentation and a direct line to innovation. No industry can survive without an investment in uncovering new knowledge. With that experimentation comes some failure, but those mistakes come together to unveil brilliance. Ninety percent of LEGO staff’s brilliant ideas never make it to market. There is something to be said for protecting your company’s creativity and the invaluable minds that produce the ideas often seen as far and away. Don’t allow statements like “that will never work” to kill the brilliance in futuristic thinking. LEGO keeps the workspace of their innovative team, known as the Future Lab, separate from the rest of the company. In attempts to be new and inventive do not stray too far the core experience that is the foundation for your business.

Dr. Nengas opened his presentation with an interesting fact: “Aquaculture is currently the world's fastest-growing food industry and now accounts for the over 50% of the total global seafood supply.” The global aquaculture industry is challenged with the responsibility of feeding a rapidly growing global population. As with other food production industries, aquaculture is finding ways to ensure food security by producing efficiently and sustainably. Digital agriculture innovations — like drones, satellite images and sensor technology — have allowed new concepts to emerge, such as precision farming, smart farming and digital farming. These terms, despite often being used interchangeably, have different meanings: Precision agriculture is a technology-enabled approach to farming management that observes, measures, analyzes and optimizes the need of individual fields and crops. Smart farming is the application of information and communication technologies to optimize complex farm systems. Digital farming is creating value from data. “Digital farming means to go beyond the mere presence and availability of data and create actionable intelligence and meaningful added value from such data,” explained Dr. Nengas. “Artificial intelligence is an example of this. Digital farming integrates both concepts: precision farming and smart farming.” Dr. Nengas outlined seven digital farming technologies that will impact the present and future of the global aquaculture market, from Europe to Asia-Pacific to the Americas. 1. Digital feeding CageEye, a decision-making tool, is using advanced hydroacoustic technology to monitor fish movement and environmental data with advanced machine learning algorithms. This is achieved by measuring fish density, speed and acceleration during feeding throughout the gates and visualizing this with real-time echogram images. Correlated with feeding patterns, these parameters offer unique insights into fish appetites. “By understanding fish appetites, farmers can feed according to the fish nutritional needs,” said Dr. Nengas. “This results in more efficient feeding, increased fish growth and, ultimately, increased sustainable production, addressing the demand for more seafood directly.” With this technology, CageEye claims to save up to 20% of feeding costs by reducing over-feeding. 2. Artificial intelligence Using an artificial intelligence (AI) approach, Observed technologies also identifies behavioral changes in the fish during feeding. The system learns by using cameras to observe fish movements and to measure speed, acceleration and dispersion in the cage, tank or pond. It decides when to stop feeding or change the feeding rate according to fish appetites, ensuring optimal growth and feed utilization. “Changes of behavior are not only related to feeding and appetite but also to diseases and injuries in fish,” noted Dr. Nengas. The system can also detect early disease symptoms, which leads to a reduction in mortalities and antibiotic use, environmental protection and an overall improvement in farm management. 3. Computer vision “The development of computer vision and deep learning promises to help reduce the human element while helping farmers enhance monitoring, adopt more efficient growth methods, increase yields and, ultimately, increase profit,” said Dr. Nengas. To illustrate, he gave two examples: Stingray is a company that uses stereo camera vision, advanced software and targeted lasers for lice removal without causing any damage to the fish or the environment. Cermaq’s iFarm is using image recognition devices to bring fish health and welfare to a new level, as fish are individually monitored for growth, sea lice, disease, lesions and other issues. “Overall, moving from mass to individual monitoring of the performance of fish will bring about multiple benefits by optimizing management, increasing growth rate and fish utilization, minimizing mortalities, and protecting the environment and profitability for the farmer,” said Dr. Nengas. 4. Smart sensing Data from sensing technologies and underwater cameras can be uploaded to an online software tool, which the farm operator can view from their operation room, PC, tablet or smartphone. “It allows operators to have a full view of the nutrition, health and environment of the species in the farm, enabling them to be proactive and take action before a situation becomes critical,” said Dr. Nengas. aquaManager is an example of the kind of commercial analytics software used in aquaculture to centralize multiple sources of data on a single cloud-based platform. This mobile data application synchronizes with a live farm operations dashboard to provide real-time insights and predictive analytics. 5. Underwater drone data collectors “Today, visual inspections conducted below the surface and the seabed are normally carried out by fixed-camera systems, divers or heavy ROVs,” explained Dr. Nengas. “While utilizing divers is expensive and represents significant risks, ROVs have traditionally been very costly and require extensive training to manage. On the other hand, fixed cameras have natural limitations when it comes to reach and flexibility. With the underwater drone, you have a mobile underwater camera, which allows you to carry out your own inspections whenever and wherever you want.” Underwater drones help monitor off-surface farms and track environmental parameters such as pH, salinity, oxygen levels, turbidity and pollutants. Farm operators can check for mortalities in the cage, monitor feeding and inspect underwater cages for damage or net holes through the drones. Specialized drones can even repair nets. 6. Augmented reality “Imagine a tool similar to Google Glass, where the farm manager can have all the information off its cage, pond or tank visually,” said Dr. Nengas as he explained how the U.S. Navy uses Divers Augmented Vision Display — a high-resolution sonar image superimposed onto a diver's visuals — and its significant implications for the ability to increase agriculture productivity. For example, CSIRO, an Australian technology company, has developed a tool using augmented reality (AR) for shrimp farming management. The farmer will practically be able to visit the farm by looking at information related to the shrimp, like quantity, size, mortalities, feed quantities, FCR, health and real-time environmental parameters. “The system would be an important tool for on-the-spot decision-making and management actions,” added Dr. Nengas. 7. Virtual reality Virtual reality (VR) is being used by the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) to increase the next generation's interest in aquaculture and to train new employees in the industry. NTNU has developed an aquaculture simulator that uses VR for interested parties to virtually visit a fish farm. For example, the trainee can observe the sea cage, go underwater to understand fish behavior in certain culture conditions, feed the stock and see how fish behave when feeding. The driving force of smart farming is the Internet of Things, also known as IoT. “In the aquaculture industry, imagine an interconnected network of devices, sensors, computers, tanks, grading equipment, fish counters, pumps within a state-of-the-art fish farm communicating with each other, sending and uploading critical data to a central command station, providing the operator a complete view of the entire facility,” said Dr. Nengas. “This is the potential for IoT in fish farming.” IoT enables the generation of a huge amount of data, which can be: Streamed to and stored safely in the cloud Analyzed and manipulated using big data tools Used in combination with science tools to detect and predict production parameters Referred to during important decision-making “Sustainability through optimization is a benefit that we’re going to obtain with the use of these technologies,” concluded Dr. Nengas. “I do believe strongly that digital technologies will make the difference.” I want to learn more about aquaculture nutrition and innovations.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/7-top-digital-farming-innovations-impacting-aquaculture","title":"\n\n                    7 top digital farming innovations impacting aquaculture\n                    ","date":"October 27, 2020","contentLength":1280}},{"pageContent":"“I want us all to imagine that we are in 2050, and we’re looking back on this moment, this day, and we ask ourselves: did we do everything that we could do to make the world the place that we want it to be?” Jack Bobo, CEO of Futurity, opened his keynote presentation at the Alltech ONE Virtual Experience with a challenging question for the audience. If our mission is for a better future of food and agriculture, what can we do to achieve this? The answer begins with a simple yet effective solution: we need to listen to the narratives surrounding these industries. “We give meaning to the world around us through the stories that we tell… so today in my presentation, I’d like to talk about three different stories of what food and agriculture means.” The three stories Bobo focused on were those of: Conservationists. Consumers. Farmers. These three groups of people have one goal: a plentiful future of food and agriculture. However, these three groups tend to actively work against each other. But why is that? Starting with conservationists and the planet In 2018, the World Wildlife Fund’s Living Planet Report documented that 60% of wildlife populations on the planet have disappeared between 1970 and 2014. We also know that 20% of the Amazon has disappeared in the last 50 years. “So, this dramatic loss in biodiversity has occurred within the lifetimes of many of us,” said Bobo. “Biodiversity is undergoing this incredible challenge, and things are not looking good.” According to these findings, the future will suffer the same trend of degrading biodiversity. “So, we have this tremendous challenge of not destroying all of our wild spaces,” said Bobo. However, the bigger question is, “How do we make sure that we leave a world for our children that’s as good or better than the one we received?” Many people wonder: Is agriculture the problem or solution to our conservation struggles? People tend to believe the former, yet Bobo is not convinced. “But how do we talk about it?” asked Bobo. “What’s the story that we need to tell?” The stories we hear about biodiversity tell us that: Of global respondents, 80% believe that poverty has either increased or remained the same over the past 20 years. The food system is broken, and agriculture is failing the people around us. All deforestation is due to agriculture. We do not have the means to feed the rapidly growing population. The stories we need to tell about biodiversity are that: Statistically, there is less poverty than there was 20 years ago — “Yet the public,” said Bobo, “think things are getting worse.” We are producing more food on the same amount of land than we were 50–60 years ago — “This is important,” said Bobo. “If food production stays ahead of population growth, well, that means people become better fed, they rise out of poverty, nutrition and hunger disease.” Better productivity and higher yields mean more food is being produced due to higher efficiency — “Improved productivity has saved a billion hectares of forest around the world. So more than a quarter of all the forest — nearly a third of all the forest — would be gone today without productivity increases.” The rate of population growth was at its highest in 1968 when we were growing at 2.1% per year. However, today we are growing at about 1% per year. As we continue to project toward the future, that number will keep going down. Because population growth will slow dramatically but, “if that productivity was to continue, every day after 2050, it gets easier to feed the world,” said Bobo. “And so, I want to look at this question of sustainability, and how it impacts the stories we tell about the world we live in,” explained Bobo. Diving into sustainability with consumers Bobo says that sustainability is not a destination — it is a journey. However, sustainability means different things to different people. Is it organic food? Regenerative agriculture? GMOs? Consumers, in particular, seem the most concerned about sustainability in agriculture. The stories we hear about sustainability are that: Farmers need to use less fertilizer and insecticide in order to reduce run-off into the local environment. We need to farm organically. Europe has pushed to intensive agriculture and is reducing the amount of fertilizer they use and the size of their farms. This should be a global initiative. The stories we need to tell about sustainability are that: It is a challenge for farmers to use less insecticide and fertilizer because it means that they will probably produce less food — “If you produce less food on that farm, that means you’re going to need more farms,” explained Bobo. Organic agriculture produces 20–30% less food. If the whole world farmed organically, we would need to dedicate another 20­–30% to farms, and 40% of all the land on earth is already allocated to agriculture. This would have a devastating impact, according to Bobo, including the loss of our forests. Europe practices intensive agriculture but also imports 70% of its animal feed needs. Most of their imports come from Brazil, the country with the greatest level of deforestation — “So, in many ways, Europe has exported its environmental footprint to arguably the most biodiverse country on the planet,” said Bobo. No matter how you dissect it, it is clear that we have a problem: we need to produce more food. The Food and Agriculture Organization states that we are going to need 50–60% more food by 2050, but why is that the case if we are only going to see about 20% more people? This is directly due to an improvement in income and overall wellbeing, and when people are making money and feeling well, they buy more animal protein. Yet more protein means more crops to feed animals, hence, a spike in food production. “The former director general of the Food and Agriculture Organization, Jacques Diouf, once said that the amount of food that needs to be produced in the next 40 or 50 years is equivalent to the amount of food that was produced in the last 10,00 years,” explained Bobo. “Let me repeat that. The amount of food we need to produce in the next 40 or 50 years is greater than the amount of food produced in the last 10,000 years of human civilization.” The challenge is daunting, and while agriculture is getting better, it is not getting better fast enough. There are no silver bullets to solve this challenge, but we do know that we need to increase our food production as sustainably as possible. Bobo explored possible solutions, such as: Shifting diets: Many people believe that becoming a vegan or vegetarian is the solution to the problem. It is important to think about changing our diets to improve our health, but is this the way to also improve the environment? — “It’s not going to solve all of our problems,” said Bobo. He further explained that, even if the United States and Europe shifted their diets completely, people from low-income countries will be making more money in the next 30 years, which means they will be eating more protein. “So, shifting diets is important, but it can’t solve the problem all by itself.” Food waste: A third of all food produced is lost to food waste. In developed countries, a third of food is wasted post-consumer. But, in third-world countries, food is wasted because of loss in the fields, supply chain and storage — “If we could somehow address that third of food that’s lost through food waste, then that would get us most of the way to our challenge,” explained Bobo. However, there are so many types of food waste (storage, distribution, consumer, field) and food waste issues with different products (tomatoes, soybeans, corn, cantaloupes) that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to solving the issue. Technology: There are high-tech solutions, like gene editing and genetic engineering, and abundant ag-tech data that proves cover crops produce a higher return on investment and a lower environmental footprint. Alternative proteins: “Of course, these alternative proteins are part of the solution,” said Bobo. “The problem we have, though, is that companies that are producing these different products… they’re talking about them as the solution. That plant-based proteins can eliminate livestock. That cell-based agriculture is going to make dairy obsolete.” This approach suggests that there is a silver-bullet solution to a really complex problem, “and as we’ve already discussed,” said Bobo, “there’s not one solution to the problem.” Bobo also notes that the protein market is a trillion-dollar opportunity and will only get bigger in 2050. “And so, who really believes that plant-based meat is going to become a trillion-dollar industry in just 30 years?” asked Bobo. These solutions are all necessary for achieving sustainability. However, they have become competitors in the market rather than working together as a single solution. Bobo says we need to think about what the future will look like, and work toward opportunities instead of focusing on problems. “We don’t need one solution,” explained Bobo. “We need them all.” Actively working on these solutions with farmers is the best and most effective way to achieve the goals of conservationists and consumers. Working with farmers “I’m just happy that consumers and conservationists are now joining farmers on this journey of sustainability,” said Bobo. “Because we could use their help. Instead of framing it as agriculture is the problem to be solved, we need to help them to understand that agriculture is the solution to the problem.” What we find from data collected by the World Resources Institute is that if agriculture continues to improve the way it has been, 60% of the gains we need to achieve a sustainable future will happen just by farmers continuing what they are already doing. The data also talks about incentivizing steps that will increase productivity and improve efficiency in: Livestock production. Reducing methane emissions. Using less fertilizer. “Well, efficiency is something farmers want to do… So, these are huge opportunities. These are not challenges,” said Bobo. However, if agriculture is the solution to our problem — the answer to improving the future of food — then why do we still hear that agriculture is the problem to be solved? “Why do we talk about a broken food system when the food system was never not broken?” asked Bobo. While it may be broken, Bobo assured the audience that the food system is better than it has ever been, and it will only continue to get better every day. But it is just not happening fast enough. Yet if we continue to spend our time spreading false stories and narratives about farmers being the problem, we cannot actively work with them toward a solution. Organic agriculture may be critical to saving the planet, but it does not mean that genetic engineering and gene editing are not. New alternative proteins are critical to saving the planet, but so are dairy farms and livestock production. “It takes a menu of solutions to solve a problem,” explained Bobo. Final thoughts Bobo asked us an important question at the beginning of his presentation: Thirty years from now, will we be confident that we did everything that we could do to make the world the place that we want it to be? Again, conservationists, consumers and farmers all want the same thing: a safe, plentiful and sustainable future of food and agriculture. The only way to achieve that goal is to start telling the same story, even if we are not always on the same page. “Because if we do that,” said Bobo, “we all can save the planet.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/how-improve-future-food-and-agriculture-jack-bobo","title":"\n\n                    How to improve the future of food and agriculture – Jack Bobo\n                    ","date":"May 21, 2020","contentLength":1987}},{"pageContent":"Alltech global headquarters welcomed the new members of the Career Development Program (CDP) on Sept. 21. Eleven recent college graduates from 11 countries were selected for the year-long program. Ten of them completed an intense weeklong orientation at Alltech’s global headquarters in Nicholasville, Kentucky, USA, while the other did so at the Alltech European headquarters in Dunboyne, Ireland, where he will be based. The group is divided into three specialized areas: beef, dairy and quality. These tracks are tailored for specific growth markets and departments within the company. During the orientation, CDP members learned about Alltech and met numerous Alltech employees, from recent hires to senior executives. A highlight was meeting Alltech’s president and founder, Dr. Pearse Lyons, who shared advice on starting a career at Alltech, along with Dr. Aoife Lyons, director of educational initiatives at Alltech and a licensed clinical psychologist. “We were delighted to welcome our 11 new specialized CDP members. Each one of them was chosen based on their educational history, but more importantly their soft skills, such as curiosity, flexibility and enthusiasm,” said Dr. Aoife Lyons. “It is exciting to see these energetic recent grads with fresh perspectives joining the Alltech family.” “Orientation week was such a humbling and honoring experience,” said Alexandra Dawson, a food science and nutrition graduate from Australia, a new member of CDP quality track. “It was great to meet a wonderful group of people, all from different countries, and then to have so much pertinent and useful advice given to us by senior executives as well as former CDP members.” After their orientation, CDP members learned about the training they will receive in their respective specializations. Those in the beef track will focus on improving animal health and welfare, while increasing beef farm profitability in the European beef market. The dairy track targets solutions to boost profitability in dairy production in Asia. The quality track encompasses all aspects of product manufacturing, including the Alltech Quality System (AQS), the most comprehensive quality system in the industry.

This week, I commenced looking at various parameters for my assigned focus on the transition period in dairy cows. I spent time every day collecting total mixed rations (TMR) and manure samples, and freezing them for further consistency analysis with the nutritionist. I also started to weigh and record weighback feed so that we can document exactly what the cows are eating, while beginning to body condition score dry, fresh and lactating cows and checking their rumination patterns. Also this week, I took some straw samples to be sent to the Alltech lab for analysis. In doing so, I decided that in order to take an accurate sample, I would need to wait until they began to grind the bales in the feed centre. It was a good idea, as I ended up with a varied sample, but I also ended up with two boots full of straw and dust that I’m now trying to get out of my carpet at home. That is all part of the job I suppose! One thing is for sure… I have been staying very busy! As far as curious cows go, there is definitely a good contingent of them here at Herrema Dairy. Each time I enter a pen to carry out a task I usually end up with my own little pack of cows following close behind sniffing and licking my clothes.

Amino acids are the building blocks of protein, and the quality of a protein is determined by its balance in term of essential amino acids. Not all protein sources are created equal. A cow’s protein and amino acid requirements can be met by a protein source with an amino acid composition that closely matches the composition of what the cow is producing, such as milk protein and muscle. By focusing on the amino acid composition of the protein supply to the cow, we can efficiently meet the cow’s protein requirements without overfeeding protein while meeting the correct amino acid balance. Feed the rumen Ruminants derive protein from two sources: microbial protein synthesized in the rumen and escape protein provided in feedstuffs. Microbial protein provides 50 - 60 percent of the protein supply to the typical dairy cow. Bacteria and protozoa in the rumen ferment carbohydrates and protein supplied from the ration into more bacteria and protozoa that will provide protein to the cow. Microbial protein is a very high quality protein in that the amino acid composition matches that of milk protein. Feed the cow For high producing dairy cows, microbial protein alone will not provide a sufficient protein supply. A feed source of protein is required to meet a high-producing cow’s protein requirements. This protein must escape degradation in the rumen and will directly provide protein to the cow. The amino acid profile of escape protein sources is critical to how well that protein can positively affect milk production and efficiency. New technology to provide optimal amino acid supply A study conducted at South Dakota State University by Dr. Javier Sabbia et al. (2012)1 demonstrated the importance of proper protein nutrition as well as the application of a product designed to meet the cow’s requirements for amino acids. DEMP (DEMP®, a yeast-derived microbial protein produced by Alltech, Inc.) is a source of high quality protein with an amino acid prodile that closely matches that of reference protein sources such as milk protein and microbial protein. The product is partially digested by the microbes in the rumen and supplies essential peptides (small proteins) and free amino acids that may maximize microbial protein synthesis. In addition, the portion of DEMP that escapes the rumen supplies the cow with a high quality protein directly from feed. Research showed that DEMP supports the protein supply to the cow by increasing microbial protein production and by supplying a feed source of high quality amino acids. DEMP vs. soybean meal To examine the implications of a protein source on lactating dairy cows, Sabbia and colleagues replaced varying portions of soybean meal with DEMP. Plant proteins such as soybean and canola meal and distillers grains comprise most of the protein fed to ruminants in the United States. By replacing equal amounts of soybean meal with DEMP at 0, 300, 600, and 900 grams per cow per day, the researchers were able to compare how well DEMP versus soybean meal met the amino acid requirements for a lactating cow. The cows were fed a typical Midwestern lactating TMR primarily composed of corn silage, alfalfa hay, ground corn and soybean meal. The researchers found that milk production increased by replacing a portion of soybean meal with DEMP at varying rates. The rations containing 300 and 600 grams of DEMP resulted in the most milk, 92 pounds compared to 87 pounds for the control (standardized to 4 percent fat and 3.2 percent protein). Milk fat content increased by 0.09 to 0.13 percent with the inclusion of DEMP. In addition to measuring performance parameters, the researchers at SDSU took measurements to determine the effect of treatment on rumen function, using both ruminally canulated cows as well as an in vitro procedure in the lab. Rations including DEMP resulted in lower rumen ammonia and branched-chain VFA concentrations. Both of these parameters indicate protein degradation in the rumen; lower values for the DEMP ration indicate degradation of feed protein was lower. Together these variables indicate that DEMP is less degradable in the rumen than soybean meal and will provide more high quality escape protein from feed to the cow. Using an in vitro procedure developed to simulate rumen fermentation in the lab, researchers observed that true dry matter digestibility increased by 1.4 to 2.7 percentage units when DEMP replaced soybean meal. This observation supports the second hypothesis on DEMP’s method of action: improving rumen efficiency thereby improving feed digestion and microbial protein flow. Feed a complete protein Improving protein supply to the cow by increasing the flow of high quality microbial protein from the rumen and providing a feed source of high quality protein can allow for increased milk production, as observed in the high producing cows used in the South Dakota State study. The benefits of replacing common sources of plant protein with a high quality protein include increased milk production, higher efficiency of protein utilization, and the potential to feed lower protein rations. Microbial protein and DEMP have similar amino acid profile Microbial protein and DEMP closely match the amino acid profile of milk protein Soybean meal and other plant proteins do not match the amino acid profile of milk protein as well, indicating that soybean meal does not meet the animal’s requirements for amino acids The full article can be accessed at journalofdairyscience.org. 1Sabbia, J.A., K.F.

New diseases are shocking and scary in a modern world, causing public health officials to shore up response plans and funding organizations to mobilize. Reappearance of 'old' diseases is in many ways even more appalling because it usually means public health measures have failed or prevention would have been possible. Why do old diseases re-emerge? Lots of old diseases are new again Re-emerging diseases are caused by known pathogens that have either spread to new geographic areas or populations, evolved into more infectious forms or reappeared after having been eradicated. Numerous examples include reappearance of cholera in the Americas in 1991 and evolution of drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis. Influenza, familiar to all of us, is constantly re-emerging. Its genetic variations and rapid adaptations allow the virus to serve up new strains each cold-and-flu season that our immune systems are not primed to fight. Environmental changes ranging from dam construction to earthquakes and tsunamis alter water levels and drainage patterns that in turn alter the ecology of insect vectors such as the mosquito that carries Dengue Fever. Politics play a role as well. For instance, political upheaval following the demise of the Soviet Union interrupted public health controls and vaccine availability that allowed diphtheria to become epidemic in Russia, Ukraine and the newly independent states. Politics is also a factor in funding prevention programs. While an epidemic is raging, the political momentum needed to throw public money into the fight is easily gathered. Once epidemics are controlled, however, political winds change. It is much harder to sway votes to fund clinic maintenance and prevention strategies. How new zoonotic diseases emerge Disease spillover - one of the perils of a crowded planet Host, pathogen and environment together determine whether a new disease emerges. Something disturbs the balance. When the disease is caused by a zoonotic pathogen (one that jumps from animals to humans), the biggest disturbance happens when human and animal ecologies overlap to provide easy opportunities for pathogen spillover. Ours has become an increasingly crowded planet. The human population went from 1.6 to 6.1 billion in only 100 years (1900-2000). We are part of the biggest demographic event in human history. Our exploding human population is paralleled by a huge increase in food and companion animal numbers. In 2014, wildlife, human and domestic animal habitats overlap to an alarming extent at many points on the globe. Imagine what the overlap will look like in 2050 with an expected human population of >9 billion… Closer and more frequent contact among species simplifies spillover of disease-causing pathogens. Bats, along with rats, are reservoirs for many pathogens and interact with many species. Reservoir hosts carry and transmit a pathogen, but survive the infection. Bats have been implicated in a number of spillover outbreaks in recent years, including the Ebola and Marburg hemorrhagic fevers caused by filoviruses. Bats are excellent reservoir species as they have relatively long lives, live in colonies, and range widely across wildlife, human and food animal habitats. Transmission dynamics are not completely understood, but the epidemiological links are well-established. In addition to instances where food animals have served as intermediate hosts, fruit bats are also hunted for food in parts of Africa and Asia. The slaughter and preparation of bush meat provides a direct path for pathogens to jump from wildlife to humans.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/emerging-and-re-emerging-diseases-crowded-planet","title":"\n\n                    Emerging and Re-emerging Diseases on a Crowded Planet\n                    ","date":"November 24, 2014","contentLength":580}},{"pageContent":"Bob Langert, retired vice president of sustainability, McDonald’s, highlighted the importance of sustainability in the poultry industry in his comments at the Alltech REBELation. “Consumer expectations are driving the global poultry market, and sustainability is the new norm.

This program combines both business and social values to position McDonald’s as a leader in sustainability. “The Global Roundtable for Sustainable Beef is leading the way for the beef industry. I wish poultry was doing the same,” added Langert. Poultry producers should be forming groups with civil society and nongovernmental organizations to build trust within the industry. “We need to do more in a proactive way. The poultry industry needs to collaborate and set up a system of measures to show how sustainable the industry can be.

As the population grows, food production will have to increase by approximately 60 percent by 2050. How do we feed, fuel and support the growing world population? Currently 33 percent of world soils are under severe pressure from human activities that degrade and sometimes eliminate essential soil functions. At Crop Science: Growing the Revolution symposium, Robert Walker, general manager of Alltech Crop Science, addressed the importance of soil. “It takes 2,000 years for 10 centimetres of topsoil to form, and there are only 100 harvests left in UK soils,” said Walker, noting that a recent trial carried out in the UK found that city soils had 33 percent more carbon and 25 percent more nitrogen than their agriculture counterparts. Yet, he said, the agricultural soils produce more food. The United Nations General Assembly declared 2015 the International Year of Soils, and Alltech continues to highlight its importance in the food chain. Soil has a lot more to offer than just food production – soil microbes must be explored. “We have only identified 2 percent of all microbes in the soil. We need to be looking at the other 98 percent,” added Walker, underscoring that it has been 30 years since the last antibiotic was brought to market. Recently scientists found 25 new antibiotics in the soil so the potential is out there. “Microbes in soil make the plant more resistant to pathogens. By adding microbes to the soil, it can add a lot of money to your yield. It's a business that is going to double in value,” Walker said. Crop science has huge growth potential.

Oily fish, such as anchovies and sardines are currently being over-fished. These fish are processed and turned into pellets to feed larger farmed fish, which are being sold to the human health market to make fish oil supplements, functional foods and pharma applications. These practices are not sustainable and without increased aquaculture production, the world will face a seafood shortage of 50 to 80 million tons by 20301. Fish contribute to 16% of the world’s protein, but with land and fresh water in short supply the aquaculture industry is facing a huge crisis on whether or not the industry can grow at a sustainable rate. Researchers have predicted that if fishing rates continue apace, all of the world’s fisheries will collapse by the year 20482. Global concerns on sustainable fishing practices are due to the growing demand. It takes approximately 1.5 kg of small wild fish, like anchovies, sardines and salmons being caught in the ocean to produce ½ kg of farmed salmon. Alternative sources are required to ensure the sustained production and nutritional quality of farmed fish. Fish oil derived from fisheries, is the most common source of omega-3 fatty acids. Fish oil is typically extracted from oily cold-water fish such as cod, halibut and tuna. Traditionally, fish oil was used in animal feeds to support the wellness of the animal and ensure a healthier final product for the consumer. However, the fish oil industry has gone through a dramatic transformation due to the limited availability, prices have gone through the roof and quality has gone through the floor. Some farmers are opting to use cheaper alternatives high in omega-6, like vegetable oil and sunflower oil. These alternatives often lack beneficial DHA omega-3, limiting their health benefits and creating the need for sustainable sources needed for optimal animal nutrition. To avoid overfishing, alternative sources are being examined to provide nutrients formerly supplied by fish and fish oil to feed the growing population. Algae are gaining attention for their application in the feed and food industries as a highly sustainable source of protein and DHA omega-3. Moreover, the omega-3 content in fish originates from their consuming the algae directly or other creatures that feed on algae. Sustainable aquaculture practices using algae have the potential to minimize the impact from overfishing, while providing a nutritious protein source of DHA omega-3. This solution comes at a critical time as the growing human population will be too great for the seafood industry to sustain environmental and economic demands. In America alone, 7,000,000 tons of fish are consumed per year and to meet that demand, 91% of the fish were imported, resulting in a $12,000,000,000 trade deficit3. The ocean can no longer be treated as an unlimited source of protein. The industry must make a change and algae provide a unique opportunity to replace nutrients formerly supplied by fish and fish oil to meet the current consumption trends.

However, after successfully mapping both the human genome and several domestic animals’, scientists are left with more questions and the realization that genetic expression is more about the environment than it is the genes themselves. This study of genes and their interactions is what drove Dean Boyd, technical director for The Hanor Company, to leave the academy and take scholarship to the field. Rebelling against status quo, Boyd strives to provide scientific discoveries based in unbiased, field applied research. At Pork: The other white meat? symposium, during The Alltech REBELation conference in Lexington, Kentucky, USA, he shared some of his findings in regards to genetic expression in pigs and their role in profitability. When first entering the field, Boyd was taken aback by the high number of researchers functioning on personal biases. These biases lead them to publish skewed or limited findings that were ultimately costing the pork industry significant losses. To rectify the situation, Boyd sought to identify the key performance factors in gene expression and the impact of those expressions on profitability through empirical experiments and large amounts of data. Gene expression in the field First and foremost, Boyd found that gene expression is very much modified by the environment, being mainly limited by immune stress and nutrition. However, it’s important to note that viability can only truly be tested under moderate to high immune stress conditions. To adequately analyze a genome, it must be challenged by a variety of field pathogens to understand how the animal is truly programmed. Because of this need for testing under challenging conditions, producers need data from not only the genetic nucleus (which is readily available), but also field data describing how the genes were expressed during challenging conditions (which is less often available). Even with sufficient data and research, Boyd makes it clear that science will not always get things right, stating that Mother Nature is very complex. However, he clarifies that while all science has potential errors, it is essential to steer clear of ‘isolated science,’ or science that has singular focus. These types of experiments tend to be focused on only one aspect of production, and while they provide impressive figures for proposed outcomes (i.e. litter size), they also typically come with unexpected downsides in other areas (i.e. birth weight and viability). The give and take relationship within pork production can be easily overlooked when only one performance indicator is being tracked. As an example, pigs weaned at 12 days as opposed to 21 days reduced their days to 270lbs by 34 days. However, their mortality rate was also increased by 5.8 percentage points. Boyd describes the give and take relationship as somewhat of a chain reaction. Increased litter size: Decreased birth weight Decreased birth weight: Increased mortality rate/reduced viability Increased mortality rate/reduced viability: Decreased lifetime full value of sow To simply focus on litter size neglects other needed components including uterine capacity, the prevention of decline (or ideally an increase) in placenta mucus, milk output, nipple number, and nipple placement. Boyd knew producers needed access to better science. Five research platforms In an effort to provide integrated, reliable, and thoughtful research to producers, Boyd has developed a financial analysis worksheet that is based on five research platforms. Number of FVP full value pigs (FVP) weaned Number of FVP delivered to plant Wean to plant viability Minimum cull and light sale pigs Carcass weight (volume) Carcass output/sow + annual + lifetime (cost dilution) This accounts for and addresses seasonal infertility, which for many producers is a larger threat to profitability than even disease. Weaned pig and W-F cost Feed and non feed companies Through these factors, Boyd and his colleagues have created a benchmarking system with which they are able to analyze pork production units’ profitability, finding that the most differentiating factor, in both profit and loss years, is viability. While viability is the most significant differentiator; there are many key profit drivers to consider including pig numbers to market, pig livability, heavy carcass weight, and production costs. At first glance, one might assume production costs most strongly influenced profits, but in fact, pig numbers to market does. Conclusion In addition to managing these key profit drivers, Boyd explained, it is essential to have integrated team functions. Veterinarians, nutritionists, and those in production need to have an open dialogue where they can actively and effectively work together. One of the largest challenges the industry is facing is a recent shift in consumer culture. Previously, science has been an influential driver in consumer decisions. However, due to some strategic moves and changes in technology, marketing has positioned itself as a more influential voice in consumers’ lives. A great example of this is the antibiotic free (ABF) debate. Regardless of what science may suggest (i.e. antibiotic free vs. antibiotic residue free), consumers are demanding ABF products, so producers must be prepared to deliver them. An integrated team is the best way to ensure pork producers are prepared to address these changing consumer demands. All in all, it is important for producers to recognize that mapping the genes of pigs is one small step towards fully understanding those genes’ interactions with the environment around them. To potentially improve profitability, it is essential to acknowledge the interactions between all the various factors of production, focusing on the key profit drivers and working closely with an integrated team.

These infections, caused by harmful microorganisms in the gut, can leave poultry integrators with high treatment costs and losses in production. When it comes to maintaining a healthy flock, it’s the good bacteria and gut health that can make or break a successful poultry operation. This is the approach Alltech has taken with their new Gut Health Management program, which uses the Seed, Feed, and Weed approach to support animal performance by promoting good bacteria, building natural defenses and maximizing growth and efficiency. Seed, Feed and Weed introduces the proper microorganisms, maintains a proper environment for them to survive and weeds the unfavorable organisms before they colonize the intestinal tract. When paired with effective biosecurity measures, this tactic allows the animals to have the best chance for optimal productive performance, even without antibiotic growth promoters. From hatch to finish, the Alltech Gut Health Management program incorporates different nutritional technologies, analytical services and technical support to help prevent and treat the main gut health issues affecting integrators today. “With the right intestinal ecology, the villi will flourish and nutrient absorption will be maximized, which in turn will lead to maximized growth and performance,” said Paulo Rigolin, global poultry director for Alltech. “This program supports the company’s commitment to partner with integrators to make sure their flocks are performing at their maximum potential.” To learn more about Alltech Gut Health Management, contact your local Alltech representative.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/profitable-poultry-production-it-all-comes-down-gut-health","title":"\n\n                    Profitable Poultry Production: It All Comes Down to Gut Health\n                    ","date":"April 2, 2018","contentLength":259}},{"pageContent":"Amino acids — the basic building blocks of every organism — are important for plant growth, development and metabolism. Plants must synthesize amino acids in order to grow, develop and perform all routine metabolic functions. While animals must obtain amino acids through their diets, plants can synthesize their own. However, in order to conduct this process in the most efficient manner, plants must have an adequate and continuous supply of beneficial nutrients. Water and sunlight availability are also key in order for plants to perform these functions. Building from a strong technology base As a leader in chelation technology for animals, Alltech is now applying the same technology principles to plants for the benefit of crop producers. Alltech Crop Science has focused on the principles of complexing to support and improve plant nutrient uptake. How? The inherent complexing nature of amino acids is used to deliver a balanced source of essential nutrients in a uniquely bioavailable form. Improving efficiency through precision application “With foliar-applied micronutrients, complexed minerals are easily and quickly absorbed and their uptake is optimized,” said Nicolas Body, agronomist and European technical manager for Alltech Crop Science. This can aid in production efficiency. “There is basically zero waste,” added Body. “Rapid absorption by leaves, combined with targeted application, can provide plants with immediate access to essential nutrients.” Plant-based solutions for a sustainable future Alltech has the ability to “grow” these natural microorganisms at company facilities for amino acid extraction. In fact, 18 of 20 amino acids can be extracted from yeast, which is Alltech’s core competency. With one of the largest yeast facilities in the world, Alltech has a bountiful supply of raw materials utilized for the production and extraction of these naturally occurring amino acids. “We are finding in nature the tools to help producers with nutrient management as well as crop protection and performance,” said Body. “Today, it is now possible to use natural organic acids to do the job of synthetic chemicals.” This technology will help growers and consumers promote environmental sustainability without compromising quality and yield. Maintaining plant health through proper nutrition can reduce the need for synthetic inputs that can cause consumer concerns and pose environmental risks. The following essential plant micronutrients have successfully been complexed with amino acid technology and can promote efficiency with each of the following functions: Copper: Essential for chlorophyll formation and reactions involved in photosynthesis. Sandy, high-pH soils are most prone to copper deficiency. Manganese: Aids in germination, maturity and availability of other nutrients. Waterlogged, high-pH organic soils are most prone to manganese deficiency. Herbicide stress is also a common contributing factor to manganese deficiency. Zinc: Essential for growth, zinc plays a role in building growth hormones and in photosynthesis. Zinc deficiency is common with cool, wet weather and appears as stunted growth and shortening of internodes.

Toxin-producing molds may invade plant material in the field before harvest, during post-harvest handling and storage, and during processing into food and feed products. Prevention through sound management practices is essential, since there are limited ways to completely overcome problems once mycotoxins are present. 1. Understanding contamination: Plants are infected with mold and mycotoxins when spores of certain diseases are released and blown onto plants and soil. Spores can overwinter in the soil, leading to infection in the following years. 2. Prevention: Three steps can aid in the prevention of mycotoxin infestations. The first step should be to act before any infection has occurred. If that is not possible, you should act during the period of fungal invasion of the plant material and mycotoxin production. If, unfortunately, you should miss either of those opportunities, action should instead be initiated when the agricultural products have been identified as heavily contaminated. Most of your efforts should be concentrated on the two first steps because once mycotoxins are present, they are difficult to eliminate. A list of recommendations for attempting to limit mycotoxin presence in corn has been released by the North Carolina State University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences. The suggested steps include: Early planting Reducing drought stress Minimizing insect damage Early harvest Avoiding kernel damage during harvest Drying and storing corn properly Disposing of corn screenings instead of feeding them to animals 3. Seed hybrids: If mycotoxins or diseases have been present in previous years, selecting seed hybrids that are resistant to them can reduce the risk and/or the severity of the infection. Some diseases can also be seed-borne, so it is important to be selective with the seed hybrids chosen for upcoming years. 4. Crop rotation and tillage: Due to the cycle of fungi and spores wintering in the soil and on crop residues, increased tillage and crop rotation are recommended to help control crop residues and potential mycotoxin contamination. Removal, burning or burial of crop residues aids in the reduction of Fusarium inoculum, which could affect the subsequent crop. 5. Planting date: The date when seeds or seedlings are planted can also affect the contamination of your crop. Ideally, the flowering stage of the crop and spore release would not occur at the same time, in order to reduce the chances of infection. However, weather changes could challenge any advantages manifested by appropriately timing your planting. 6. Plant nutrition: Well-nourished plants have more effective defenses. A proactive fertilizer program, accompanied by the best practices listed above, can help reduce the need for chemical pesticide intervention later in the season. 7. Managing the problem: Sound management practices in the field won’t eliminate the need for a mycotoxin management plan during storage or at the feed mill — they can help make an unmanageable problem manageable, but no approach is 100-percent effective, and new contamination can occur at multiple points, including during transport and storage. Consequently, mycotoxin risk should be evaluated and addressed throughout the feed chain.

From farm to processing plant, from supermarket to plate, it’s important to know that your food was handled in a safe and ethical manner at every step of the journey. This episode takes a look at Red Tractor, one of the most trusted food assurance programs. Alltech’s David Butler recently sat down with food industry leader Philip Wilkinson to better understand how Red Tractor provides peace of mind to the consumer. You can listen to the podcast in full or view the transcript below. I'm David Butler and my guest today is Philip Wilkinson, Executive Director of Two Sisters Food Group. Actually that's just one of many positions that Philip holds. He took some time to talk to us about food safety, traceability and Red Tractor, the United Kingdom's leading farm and quality food assurance program. Their motto is, \"we trace it so you can trust it\". So, I’m Philip Wilkinson, Executive Director of Two Sisters Food Group which is the largest poultry producer for broiler meat in Europe. I’m Vice President of AVEC, which is the European Poultry Association, a board member of the British Poultry Council, and on the Board of Assured Foods Standards in the UK. That is a lot of hats to wear. Yeah it is, but they are all interconnected so it works very well. And a lot of what you do is related to messaging to the end consumer is that correct to say? Yeah. The Assured Foods Standards brand, or mark, you would know as being a Red Tractor which is underpinned by the Union Jack, the Union flag of the UK. And, that is a mark that has been on the go now since the year 2000 when it was launched. In dollar terms the sales value in 2015 will be in the region of $22-23 billion US. So, it has come from zero to hero in that 15 years and would be the mark that the vast majority of citizens and consumers in the UK would recognize in terms of one of quality, traceability, assurance, and would give them trust. They would know that that kind of symbolizes everything that’s important to them and their food. We like to think so. But, it’s a little bit like painting a very large bridge. It’s never ending. You get to the end and you got to start at the beginning again. So it’s an evolutionary process. We didn’t put something in place back in the year 2000 and it stayed exactly the same in 2015. It moves with the times. We tweak it here, we tweak it there in order to keep up with what is considered to be important in the minds of consumers. At the time that this was launched, there was no carbon footprint message going around whereas we now know that is a major part of the sustainability debate. So, we are now looking at being true to that objective and G20 leaders have signed up to that agreement to hit benchmarks by 2020 and there are milestones in that process, so we have bought into that as part of our message and that will fall into our activities going forward across all meat proteins and crops, as well, because the Red Tractor does embrace all meat proteins together with combinable crops, so you know it’s a pretty big operation. That does seem like a huge operation and it seems like it would be very difficult to create guidelines or best practices across so many different, very diverse industries. How do you do that? Okay, and that’s a good question. Each sector is a stand-alone. So, each sector has its sector board, it has its own technical advisory committee, and what I need to share with you is that this is not an in-house initiative. This is something that is shared across the whole of the supply chain so that everyone buys into it. So, you’ve got the farming union representing the farmers. You’ve got the likes of the British Poultry Council representing the poultry processors, you’ve then got the British Retail Consortium representing the retailers. Food service representatives and also academics and independents. And, what we do, is we have a set of standards that are compiled by those people. So they are independent. The technical advisory committees are chaired by independent people. People who have got a wealth of experience in the field but are not directly involved in the supply chain. So they may be university professors who talk about this sort of stuff and I think about ours, is a guy who was a lecturer, very very well respected, at Reading University. He has been the chairman of the technical advisory committee. So that when product, and it always does happen that there will be a food scare, there is always something that is going to happen in the food industry, no matter how hard you try, you can put an independent person to front that, because it gives far more credibility than somebody like me who is an industry person who the consumer would say, “Well, he would say that anyway.” So, it gives it and this technical advisory committee, is meeting on a bi-month basis to review the standards, review the adherence to standards, to then dole out penalties to those who don’t adhere to the standards, so that the standards have integrity. Without the integrity, the consumer wouldn’t trust them and there would be chaos. Right, so you have input and knowledge and expertise that is coming from the people in the industry that worked in the industry for years and years and they’re contributing that, but you also have independent people on the boards. Just to show how fair we actually are, we even have on the board of Assured Food Standards, a representative from Compassionate World Farming. It doesn’t get more open than that. These are people who would sometimes march on the Houses of Parliament or march into KFC or into McDonald’s or into Two Sisters Food Group and cry foul. So, this is how open we are and how transparent we are in embracing the thoughts and opinions of everyone before we arrive at a decision. Wow, that’s pretty impressive. It seems a lot more genuine than, you know, a company that might create their own little kind of premium certified logo that is not backed up by anything in particular. I think that most companies who do, do that and some decide they’re going to have their own offering underpinned by Red Tractor, but then, let’s say move slightly outside that to create a point of difference for them, they would always use the Red Tractor Assurance to underpin, but then they would also rather than it stay in house, they would also use independent bodies who audit their schemes as well. And, might even help in the compilation of those schemes. Is there any talk of Red Tractor expanding beyond the United Kingdom? The Red Tractor Standards are already accepted outside of the United Kingdom because companies such as ours, or some of the retailers, or food service organizations who stand by the Red Tractor mark to the consumer as their offering have product that comes in from other countries. So, even though we produce in the UK, 19 million chickens a week, we actually consume 27 million whole bird equivalents, so those birds come in from Brazil or Thailand or elsewhere in Europe and in order for it to be a level playing field, and in order for the on pack claims to be made, equivalents have to be agreed in those countries. So, if they’re not eligible to carry the Red Tractor and the Union Jack, because obviously the Union Jack is produced in the UK; however, they are audited to those standards in those relevant countries by auditors who have been checked out by the audit bodies and the competent authorities back in the UK. So, the brand doesn’t travel, but the equivalents of it, do and that is the only way we would take product in from those countries outside of the UK. So that’s having a positive effect on the global food supply really. Yep, and as I showed in the presentation both yesterday at the food REBELation and at the poultry REBELation, I have shown that other European countries have got their own marks and emblems and logos that are for their countries that may or may not be the same as ours. They may be slightly different, but this is something that has now gone European wide, that’s for sure. And, there’s been a lot of interest as I’ve talked in other countries all over the world either in my own capacity or doing talks for Alltech. There is a massive interest in Red Tractor and the Red Tractor, and I wouldn’t say this but I know that I’m right, the Red Tractor news has traveled globally more than I would say most of the others or any of the others that I’m aware of. The only one that would sort of be internationally recognized would be the RSPCA, the Royal Society for Prevention of Cruelty of Animals which obviously goes pretty global anyway. Particularly the commonwealth countries where there would be a connection anyway. Right, that makes sense. So how is all of this activity funded? The Red Tractor is funded through usage of the mark on pack, so it’s fractions and fractions of pennies on a pack. So a licensing fee? Yes, a licensing fee which then everyone in that supply chain pays a price for. So just to give you a feel. It won’t be an exact number and I’m going to try to convert to US dollars for you, but for a poultry farm, a broiler farm in the UK to be signed up Red Tractor, it would cost circa $75-$80 a year; well in the big picture that doesn’t really even cover the auditor traveling and coming to the farm to do the audit, but because it’s funded across the whole of the supply chain, and everybody can afford to be in. If you’re a big dairy company, that’s going out on milk bottles that sit on tables, well then that’s easy, but if you are the dairy farmer you have to pay the same sort of money as they have to pay, you would never sign up in the first place. The reason why it’s been so successful is that the farm to fork supply chain has bought into it and are all doing their bit and paying for it. The cost is shared? People stand shoulder to shoulder. Yeah, yeah. It benefits everybody. Sure it does. One last question. I assume you don’t have full traceability for everything under Red Tractor yet? Do you? Traceability is so difficult. Well, I cited this morning in the poultry session that this is an example. We have got a slaughterhouse for chickens close to a 24 hour TESCO store that also stocks our chicken. The Tesco technical team will maybe totally unannounced arrive at their store at 7:30 – 8:00 o’clock in the morning, and they will pick a whole bird off the shelf, they will pick a packet of wings off the shelf, and they will pick some breast meat off the shelf jump in their car, drive two miles up to the road to our factory, knock on the door, technical manager plunk those on his desk and say, “I want traceability, full traceability down the production line back to the breeder farm where the eggs came from and I want you to do that in 4 hours on all of those products” We normally turn it around in somewhere between 2.25 – 2.50 hours. So the answer to your question, yes we can and I can even take it one step further in terms of supply chain for the feed that goes into the birds, whether it be the wheat or the soya I can do all that as well. So, in the poultry sector, I can’t speak on behalf of the other sectors because I’m not as close, but I would imagine it’s pretty much the same there. I sit very very comfortably on traceability. That’s impressive! How about that? That’s a lot of work that goes into that. But, it’s a great story to tell. You know when you get a TV scare and people are talking about horse meat and stuff like that, we had a minister for Food get on the prime time television BBC news when we had these issues and he said, “Obviously you can’t guarantee it because in the horsemeat scandal there’s a criminal element involved and the law enforcement authorities are dealing with that right now, but when asked the question by the interviewer, much the same as you are now, the interviewer said, “What would you do in a situation like this right now if you were a consumer?” And, the minister said, “look for a Red Tractor on the pack and that’s as safe as it’s gonna get.” So there’s no better endorsement on the BBC News program with ten million plus viewers watching. I’ll tell you that anytime. Yeah, and you’re not going to have, you know a government Minister going out on a limb very often if that’s not a pretty safe statement. He’s gotta be pretty cool with what he’s saying, he’s gotta be comfortable with it. Well, thank you very much Philip. Pleasure. I really appreciate it. I hope you’re enjoying your time here. Always do, I’m delighted to be back here. Always enjoy it. I want to thank Philip for spending some time with us.

The data was based on the real-time numbers of confirmed cases, recovery rates and mortality rates in each province or city. When analyzing these populations, researchers observed an association between the population’s selenium status (based on hair samples) and the rates of recovery (Figure 1). In the Hubei province, whose capital is Wuhan, it was found that Enshi City had recovery rates that were 36.4% higher than other cities within the region, where the overall recovery rate was 13.1%. Enshi City is known for its high selenium status. Outside of Hubei, in the Heilongjian province of north-eastern China, where the selenium status is notoriously low, a 2.4% increase in mortality rates was observed. China is home to people with both the lowest and highest selenium statuses in the world. Geographical differences across the country result in varied soil compositions, which can alter selenium levels. It is these differences in soil selenium levels that influence how much of the trace mineral enters the food chain from livestock feed, meat, milk and eggs, and the end consumer. Therefore, human selenium intake is very much dependent on the environment in which the crops, plants and livestock are raised. Figure 1: Correlation between COVID-19 recovery rate in 17 cities outside Hubei, China, on February 18, 2020, and city population selenium status (hair selenium concentration) analyzed using statistical methods (mean ± SD = 35.5 ± 11.1, R2 = 0.72, F test P < 0.0001) Copyright © Rayman et al., on behalf of the American Society for Nutrition, 2020. Selenium and its role in immune defense Selenium is an essential trace element for both humans and animals and is required in small amounts for normal health, growth, reproduction and immune defense. It also provides a source of antioxidants, which help to address diseases related to oxidative stress. Previous studies have shown the antiviral effects of selenium and have linked the evolution and spread of viral infectious diseases, such as swine flu and bird flu, to areas where soil selenium levels are lower (Harthill, 2011). Other studies have observed more severe viral symptoms and infection rates when dietary selenium is low (Beck et al., 2001). Viruses produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) as part of their biological makeup. These ROS are believed to be combated by glutathione peroxidase, an important antioxidant for cellular defense in which selenium plays a major role. As such, it is believed that several cellular and viral mechanisms involving selenium and selenium-containing proteins can influence the outcome of viral infections. Selenium and functional food: What do these findings mean for human health? It is important that we consume a well-balanced diet that incorporates adequate amounts of selenium to maintain our antioxidant capacity and immune defense. According to U.S. standards, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for selenium in humans is 55 micrograms a day. Dietary sources of selenium include nuts, grains and vegetables, with Brazil nuts being the richest source of selenium. However, their content is highly variable and can range from 0.03 to 512 micrograms, the latter level being potentially harmful. In vegetables, up to 40% of selenium can be lost through cooking. Highly bioavailable and organic forms of selenium have kick-started a new era in the availability of selenium-enriched products. Enriched meat, milk and eggs that contain up to 35 micrograms of selenium (more than 50% of the RDA) have been successfully developed and tested using SEL-PLEX®, Alltech’s proprietary selenium-enriched yeast (Surai et al., 2009). Livestock that are supplemented with selenium-enriched yeast show improved health, disease resistance, fertility and antioxidant capacity. Due to the high bioavailability of organic selenium-enriched yeast, the trace mineral is effectively transferred to subsequent animal products. The result is meat, milk and eggs with consistently higher selenium levels that are available to us for consumption. As we can see from this population study, organic selenium-enriched yeast could provide a promising development in functional food for human immunity and general health.

University of Guelph researchers have found when cows are fed selenium in its organic form the mineral is absorbed and integrated directly into a type of protein, milk casein. This protein enriched with selenium has the ability to reduce human breast cancer tumors growth. “With each increase of selenium, tumor growth dropped,” said John Cant, animal science professor at University of Guelph. “We saw the anti-cancer effects at every level. The study, supported by Dairy Farmers of Ontario, Alltech Inc. and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council, was started two years ago by Cant and graduate student Jenny Warrington after the topic was suggested by doctoral candidate Scott Cieslar. Using human breast cancer cells that were transplanted into mice, the researchers were able to specifically look at how the human cells grew applying four diets containing low to high levels of selenium. The diets with the highest amount of selenium showed the greatest impact on the size of the tumors, while the effects of selenium-enriched casein were significant even in the low dose diets. According to Professor Cant, the general public can also benefit from an organic selenium boost. Previously the essential mineral has been difficult to incorporate into many foods, but milk products offer a wide variety of ways to include selenium into the population’s diet. Further advantages are seen when comparing organic selenium to selenium salts (inorganic version), where the inorganic form leads to health problems at high doses, the organic version does not. A safe high ingestion is beneficial as the anti-cancer effects seen in University of Guelph’s research. Though more studies are needed to determine how selenium acts as an anticarcinogen, the outcome is evident. “We’re excited about what this product can do,” Cant said. “We have real results.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/wear-pink-and-drink-more-milk","title":"\n\n                    Wear Pink and Drink More Milk\n                    ","date":"March 29, 2018","contentLength":314}},{"pageContent":"Let's face it: raising profitable pigs is hard work. Optimizing your bottom line while staying competitive is a challenge on its own. But add fluctuating feed costs, new regulations and an unpredictable market to the mix, and the task can feel daunting. In addition, supply chain disruptions have further exacerbated the need for producers to minimize losses, with many hoping just to break even to keep their farms afloat. Whether we are in challenging or prosperous times, lowering the cost of production is essential because every pig producer is looking for ways to maintain their farm’s profitability and ensure its future for years to come. Three strategies for reducing your pig cost of production Feed costs represent the biggest input for producers, often accounting for up to 70% of production costs. Pig producers must adapt their feed strategy to maximize feed efficiency. Here are three ways to reduce production costs without impacting your herd’s performance. 1. Reducing feed costs for pigs The biggest challenges the livestock industry currently faces are the pressure to reduce feed costs and the continuous effort to gain a better understanding of available feed ingredients. The animal cannot fully utilize around 25% of the available nutrients in feed ingredients due to anti-nutritional factors in feed. Keeping that in mind, producers worldwide are making a concerted effort to lower the cost of production and maximize feed efficiency based on nutritional and economic factors (which often vary) while maintaining animal welfare and using sustainable approaches to meet demands. Pig producers look to increase feed digestibility to manage the short-term risks associated with reduced market prices. Increasing feed digestibility helps: Make more nutrients available for the pig to absorb. Improve performance, allowing producers to send animals to market faster. Lower feed costs. Enzyme technologies, such as Allzyme® Spectrum Swine, help pigs optimize the nutritional values in feed, allowing for improved dietary efficiency while supporting sustainable swine production. The unique combination of enzymes in Allzyme Spectrum Swine increases cost-efficiency by maximizing the diet’s potential at every growth stage. Developed through solid state fermentation (SSF), Allzyme Spectrum Swine produces a multi-enzyme solution that works in synergy with the complete pig diet, optimizing nutrients — including amino acids, calcium and phosphorus — while enhancing the use of raw materials (Figure 1). Figure 1: Solid state fermentation (SSF) process As a result, a complete dual action matrix is produced. This matrix gives nutritionists flexibility in formulating diets and, in turn, the release of more nutrients for the pig, which leads to cost savings for the producer. Figure 2 shows an example of a finishing diet that utilized Alltech’s enzyme technologies to improve digestibility and lower the cost per ton of feed. This example is representative of a typical diet in the eastern corn belt of the United States. Figure 2: Feed cost savings with Alltech’s enzyme technologies 2. Improving pig efficiency, starting with the sow In recent years, genetics has played a major role in improving sow efficiency by increasing the number of pigs produced per sow per year. As litter size increases, piglet birth weight decreases and litter variability increases. Low birth weight is a major predisposing factor for pre-weaning mortality (Figure 3), and lower weaning weights often result in slower growth and fatter carcasses. Figure 3: Effects of piglet birth weight on pre-weaning mortality (Feldpausch, et al., 2019) Increasing birth weight can: Improve piglet variability. Help reduce the number of pigs that require special attention. Decrease pre-weaning mortality rates. Improve piglet weaning weight. Everything you want the piglet to receive comes through the sow until weaning, so it is crucial that the sow’s nutrition program is fully implemented as planned and that she can transfer vital trace elements, such as those found in Bioplex® and Sel-Plex® trace minerals, to the piglet. Some technologies on the market today are being utilized differently now than they have been at any time to improve sow reproductive performance. Alltech’s Mineral Management program has been shown to: Increase the number of piglets born alive. Increase the birth weight of smaller pigs in the litter without affecting larger pigs (Kalaw et al., 2009). Reduce variation within the litter at weaning and slaughter (Ma et al., 2020). Figure 4: Litter birth weights from sows fed inorganic or organic trace mineral sources (Bertechini et al., 2012) Reducing weaning variation allows pig producers to market pigs in a much tighter window and reduce variation heading into slaughter. Reducing variation at slaughter can also reduce sort losses at the processing facility and lead to increased revenue per pig (Cheng, Claudy, Que and Schinckel, 2019). Bioplex minerals have also demonstrated that there is less degradation of vitamins as well as enzymes. A reduction in enzyme effectiveness or vitamin activity can lead to an increase in cost or a less favorable production response. Research has shown that several enzymes are heavily reduced in the presence of inorganic minerals and less damaged when exposed to their organic counterparts in the form of Bioplex (Santos, Connolly and Murphy, 2014). 3. Improving water consumption Does the water your pigs drink impact their performance and productivity, thereby reducing production costs? A pig’s water consumption is just as important as their feed intake because pigs that do not drink enough water will not consume enough feed. Pigs tend to drink around 10% of their body weight per day or roughly two times the amount of feed they eat. Keeping the pH in a lower range for a longer period reduces the conditions that allow harmful bacteria to grow and flourish. Adding acidifiers, such as Acid-Pak 4-Way®, to drinking water is an effective approach to acidification, especially when intake is low or variable, because it: Reduces water pH and keeps it in a more favorable range (<5 pH). Sweetens the taste of water, helping make young pigs more inclined to drink water. Improves water intake, which, in turn, improves the pig's ability to digest feed. Leads to better enzymatic activity. Acid-Pak 4-Way is typically used following weaning or during stressful times in the pig's life. The cost of pig production While numerous variables can affect production costs, understanding the factors that affect feed quality and implementing a quality-assurance program will help ensure that the best possible nutrition is delivered to your pigs and help pig producers save more money in the long run.

The highly anticipated report provides a glimpse into the animal feed industry and allows us to compare output across countries, regions and species. Compiling the data is no small task. Wherever possible we collect information from local feed associations, but in many areas our global sales team works with individual feed mills to obtain the numbers. In 2014 we saw more feed mills producing more animal feed than in past years. The estimated worth of the feed industry is now $460 billion with global production of 980 million metric tons. That's a 2 percent increase over 2013. A number of factors affected output, including: slow markets, shifting raw feed material costs, fluctuating governance over import/export standards and animal diseases such as PEDv in pigs and bird flu in poultry. However, the top 10 producing countries remained the same: China, the United States, Brazil, Mexico, India, Spain, Russia, Japan, Germany and France. To learn more, please download the survey below.

They might not be very familiar with the word “aquaculture”. They may even think of it as a novelty, something they are unsure of. As they look at the labels in the seafood case they may think of negative and positive messages they have heard about farm-raised fish. Should they buy it because it is preserving wild fish populations or should they avoid it because it is polluting our waters? Most of us still have a lot to learn about aquaculture. Industry experts gathered for the Aquaculture session at Alltech’s REBELation today. Vaun Cummins, Alltech’s senior aquaculture technician covered some of the milestones that have been hit over the past 50 years by an industry that, in actuality, represents a major segment of the global agriculture and food industries. Here are a few things that will probably surprise you about aquaculture and the traditional fishing industry: Fishing is the last significant form of hunting and gathering. However, the annual global wild catch hit its apparent limit in the early 1980s. Each year more of our seafood demand is met by aquaculture (which is just another form of agriculture). Nearly 90% of aquaculture production is in Asia, where carp are very popular. In fact 6 of the top 10 global aquaculture species are carp. In the early 1970s, the total quantity of farmed fish produced in the world was about 3 million tons, a tiny fraction of worldwide meat consumption. Now aquaculture is the fastest growing animal food production activity and in 2012 global aquaculture production reached 66 million tons, surpassing global beef production by 3 million tons. Over the last 50 years the supply of seafood has grown at about 3.2% per year, twice the rate of world population growth. For many people fish is more plentiful than ever before. Aquaculture, like any form of agriculture, can be practiced sustainably or unsustainably. Many producers are currently using methods like recirculating systems, aquaponics, multi-trophic or offshore systems to minimize environmental impact.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/farmed-fish-are-not-your-grandfathers-livestock","title":"\n\n                    Farmed fish are not your grandfather’s livestock\n                    ","date":"April 2, 2018","contentLength":360}},{"pageContent":"I feel that this is the best answer for what I feel is quite a difficult question.

Today 60 percent of food loss comes from the U.S. and Europe, yet globally more than 800 million people face hunger and malnutrition. As the population grows, food production will have to increase by approximately 60 percent by 2050. Can the reduction of food waste contribute to feeding the world? During the session on Crop Science: Growing the Revolution, Glickman identified four ways to prevent food waste: Global adoption of good Samaritan laws – These laws are intended to protect good-faith food donors from civil and criminal liability should the product cause harm to its recipient. In the U.S. 14 billion pounds of food per year is sent to landfills. Meanwhile, nearly 30 million Americans, including 12 million children, are at risk of hunger and malnutrition. The adoption of good Samaritan laws globally would reduce this risk, as well as food waste. Research and development – Budgets for agricultural research and development have not increased to meet the scientific demands of the world. Global budgets for agriculture and food security need to increase dramatically for us to increase crop yield and develop new methods of pest resistance. The role of technology – We must continue to challenge the basic principles of science. New developments in biotechnology have helped us understand nutrigenomics and genes. This form of technology must be embraced to ensure we get the full potential from our crops and arable land. Agricultural grants and education – Training and education must be supported if we are to continue to feed the world. Young men and women who wish to enter the agricultural industry must be supported and educated to ensure the future of food production can be secured.

Three fatty acids make up the omega-3 family: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Each of these omega-3 fatty acids is considered essential, meaning that they cannot be synthesized by the human body. However, not all omega-3 fatty acids are created equal. DHA is the most important of the omega-3 fatty acids, and is primarily responsible for the benefits commonly associated with omega-3 foods and supplements. A common misconception is that our body’s need for DHA can be met by consuming flaxseed, nuts and other ALA sources, which our bodies would then convert to DHA. Yet studies have shown that ALA supplements are unable to raise blood DHA levels1. Humans do have limited ability to convert dietary ALA to EPA and crucial DHA, however the efficiency of the conversion is very low (less than 1 percent)2, and dietary intake of EPA and especially DHA is necessary to maintain sufficient amounts in the body. DHA is essential for proper human development and health. Unfortunately, many diets are deficient in this vital nutrient. Alltech’s Algae Opportunity is working to mitigate this nutrient deficiency with naturally DHA-enriched functional foods by simply returning DHA-rich microalgae back into the diets of animals that produce meat, milk and eggs. By incorporating algae in the diets of livestock, both the animal and the consumer receive the expansive health benefits of DHA, improving health from feed to food.

The cold temperatures also brought to mind memories of what last year’s Old Man Winter blew into our swine barns… PEDv. With the absence of heat and dry conditions to keep the virus at bay, the disease spread through barns across 31 states. Even with a renewed focus on biosecurity measures and nutritional management, Jack Frost can bring some additional challenges that producers need to be aware of in order to protect their pigs. Here are five production areas that swine producers should concentrate on this season for optimal security: Herd flow – With potential risks for re-infection or spreading of the virus, it is essential to make sure there are proper check points for identifying infected animals and separating them from the rest of the herd. Conduct proper observance of the quarantine of replacement breeding stock with test and release procedures. Cleanliness – Severe cold temperatures make it extremely difficult to wash, clean and disinfect. Ensure all areas are completely clean and dry before exposing them to new pigs. Transportation – Animals coming in and going out are at risk for exposure by the transportation vehicles the operation is using. Guarantee their rides are completely clean and are from trusted sources that understand your biosecurity protocols. Employees – Examine foot traffic and implement proper bioesecurity measures for employees to reduce risk as employees can often work in different barns and, in some cases, for different producers. Reduce/restrict points of entry to breeding facilities. Nutrition – Animal performance is often dependent on feed quality and the performance of the feed itself.

Feedlot cattle use high-energy feed ingredients to reach their potential for meat production. With high production costs, animals must be as efficient as possible at utilizing the nutrients released from feeds in order to increase profitability at the feedlot. Cattle rely on the rumen to break down fiber; however, some undigested ingredients can bypass the rumen and cause: Hindgut fermentation Indigestion Less effective use of nutrients Identify the problem Scientists at the Alltech Center for Animal Nutrigenomics and Applied Animal Nutrition continuously analyze how specific food and diet formulations can change gene expression and alter performance. Research into the finishing stage has focused on aspects such as hot carcass weight and feed efficiency in beef cattle. Scientists have even discovered a way to predict responses to certain feed ingredients. Among the top 10 breakthroughs at the research center is a product whose name says it all: Amaize®. Amaize, an extract of Aspergillus oryzae fermentation, contains alpha-amylase enzymes that modify starch digestion, maximizing feed efficiency and increasing production. Amaize fractions starch to change the volatile fatty acid profile in the rumen, which leads to physiological changes in the animal, breaking down feed ingredients to enhance cattle metabolism. Using traditional techniques, researchers were successful in demonstrating that adding Amaize to the diet resulted in carcass weight gain for beef cattle. Conduct research in the lab Examining rumen fermentation patterns and tissue samples using gene expression, however, showed that the mode of action for Amaize was much more complex than it originally appeared. The enzyme’s impact on the animal’s metabolic system showed that Amaize optimizes animal growth not by increasing digestion; rather, Amaize promotes specific rumen microbial populations that would typically be associated with fiber digestion. Modification in microbial populations resulted in changes in rumen fermentation patterns and end products, including increased butyrate concentrations and other metabolites. The downstream effects of this shift include changes to the blood metabolites and genes related to energy utilization for growth. Gene expression evaluations have shown that genes related to the expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1), insulin receptors and growth hormone receptors were affected positively in muscle tissue. Changes in gene expression suggest a correlation to improved energy balance, increased metabolic activity and, therefore, muscle growth. Nutrigenomics has allowed scientists to more precisely understand the mechanism of action of Amaize, making it possible to issue specific recommendations to farmers regarding when and how to incorporate Amaize into their cattle’s diets, increasing growth efficiency in beef cattle. Get out of the lab and into the field While nutrigenomic studies have proven that an increase in hot carcass weight and dressing percentage were possible, field research confirmed the phenomenon of higher carcass weight in finished beef cattle, correlating to an increase in ROI. Since the discovery of the Amaize enzyme, numerous studies have been conducted in both university and commercial settings. These studies confirmed that the ideal dose rate for Amaize is 5 grams per head per day for feedlot cattle; there are no additional benefits associated with providing it at higher levels. While, individually, each of these studies showed the positive effects of feeding Amaize, it was when they were examined as a whole that the real value for the producer was uncovered. These studies included a variety of breeds, diets (including steam-flaked, rolled and high-moisture corn-based diets), locations and weather conditions — proving the consistency of Amaize in diverse conditions. The studies showed that, on average, the product has the ability to increase dressing percentage by 0.5% units and hot carcass weight by 15.5 pounds. In today’s cattle market, that extra 15.5 pounds of hot carcass weight means that Amaize achieved a 10:1 return on investment. Encourages ruminal digestion Maximizes performance *Based on an average comparison of 14 trials Using enzymes like Amaize to alter rumen fermentation and metabolism proves that it is a key component for optimizing finishing diets, driving carcass weight gain and maximizing return on investment.

These are the philosophies and formulae that our leading economists use as the foundation of their own musings and studies. But there are situations in which these theories fall short, and our greatest minds are obligated to look elsewhere for their underpinning wisdom. Speaking at the Alltech ONE Virtual Experience, respected Irish economist David McWilliams admitted that he was confronted with this very issue when thinking about how the economy will develop post-COVID-19. “We are at this extraordinary, one-off moment where the global economy is now in a tailspin,” said McWilliams, “and the timing of when we get out of that is not going to be dictated by anything you and I understand in economics.” Fortunately, having worked as an economist for around 25 years, as well as taking up a professorial post at Trinity College Dublin, McWilliams has built up other resources outside of regular economic texts that he can look to for inspiration. His advice in this instance is to look to history to determine how our ancestors dealt with and emerged from similar challenges. The events of the past have helped to inform him on: Short-term remedies. Long-term changes. The possible economic opportunities of the future. Using history as his basis, McWilliams offered insights into three potential economic phases as the world moves beyond the COVID-19 crisis. 1. A shifting psychology One point that McWilliams was certain of is that the world post-COVID will definitely not be the same as before, and neither will be the ways we look and think about our economic future. Referencing major, world-changing events of the past, such as World War I and the fall of the Berlin Wall, he said that crises tend to dramatically shift people's ways of thinking and operating. “What was radical before the crisis becomes mainstream, and what was mainstream becomes redundant,” explained McWilliams during his keynote presentation. However, McWilliams believes that a drastic change in outlook is necessary for the world to get itself back on track. He spoke about the monetary authorities around the globe as a point of reference, specifically about how they are using money and spending to help fix the current global issues. This unprecedented spending goes against the economic principles of any country. It will also doubtless lead to challenges, such as mass inflation, further down the line. But McWilliams is adamant that, in a crisis, it is essential to deal with the immediate problem first and cross the next bridge when you come to it. “You know, if you're on a football team, you don't face the potential team if they do this, that or the other,” analogized McWilliams. “You've got to face the team that's in front of you.” But quick thinking and action can only keep going for so long. Mindsets will change again, and tough decisions will need to be made. “I think the consensus that locking down is the most important thing will begin to atrophy as the economic pain amplifies, and that's a big worry,” mused McWilliams. “It's very, very hard to know where we draw the line and the trade-offs we have to make — what they are and how to make them.” As we move forward, McWilliams does believe that there should be a serious discussion about the long-term sustainability of our economies during varying states of lockdown. 2. The new global supply chain When it comes to the long-term effects of global economics, McWilliams predicts yet another significant shift in thought processes and priorities. “I think what's quite obvious for a global business is that the supply chain is going to change profoundly,” he stated. Again, looking at history, McWilliams pointed out that from the time the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 right up until early March 2020, the global mindset stayed the same. “The great corporate economic narrative is globalization, based on an extended and efficient supply chain,” explained McWilliams, “where sourcing and assembling become crucial.” However, instead of history repeating itself, McWilliams believes that the events of COVID-19 will completely change people's perceptions of what is vital for their businesses and supply chains. He thinks that the most notable differences will be that: More emphasis will be put on reliability. Cost and efficiency will become less critical factors. “I think what's going to happen is that the more extended the supply chain, the more likely you'll see that people will come back and begin to manufacture in countries that they really, really want to do business with — they trust, they understand, they feel comfortable there,” said McWilliams. “And I think that maybe price, which had been the dominant vector for many, many years in the supply chain management, will probably be elbowed out by security, by perceptions of security. Can we keep this plant open? Do we know what we're actually dealing with?” Spring-boarding off of this change in mindset, however, McWilliams believes that opportunities will arise for small countries to become important players in the global supply chain. He used his native Ireland as an example of how this can happen. From being in the depths of recession in the 1980s — when McWilliams’ own father lost his job — the country has grown economically and socially to become an essential cog in international business by building trust and relationships. “I think small cogs in the global supply chain, countries that position themselves well, could do extremely well,” McWilliams explained. “I think there's a huge opportunity, because I do think supply chains will contract. And I think that relationships will trump price; I think trust will trump competitive edge.” 3. Opportunities arise Taking both of these major mindset shifts into account, McWilliams believes that businesses and leaders with the right wherewithal could find lucrative prospects in this new economic landscape. Again, this theory is based on narratives that have repeated throughout history. In his presentation, McWilliams first referenced Florence, Italy, in the 1300s. Having suffered an enormous death toll due to the Black Death in 1347, it was believed that Florence’s then-thriving society would never recover. However, the Florentines contradicted all assumptions by ushering in the Renaissance, a historical period that forever changed how we view the world and operate within it. McWilliams then noted that something similar happened in the United States after the flu pandemic of 1918 to 1920. The country entered the new decade by diving nose-first into a period of intense deflation — but from this dark pit of despair sparked the now-famous Roaring ’20s, an economic upswing that brought electricity, radio and motor cars. “There are many instances where you imagine that humanity will go into a tailspin,” said McWilliams, “and what humanity actually does is entrepreneurs come through, leaders come through, thinkers come through, and they change the world.” With regard to the post-COVID-19 economy, McWilliams sees the same opportunities arising once again. While he did admit that not everyone will succeed and a lot of money will be lost across the board, there is potential for entrepreneurs to adapt and shine. Furthermore, putting faith in this entrepreneurial spirit, he believes that an economy can repair itself. “These opportunities emerge in crises, and you just have to have the self-confidence and belief in yourself to keep plowing on,” assured McWilliams. “And I think, as I said before, all these crises lead to great renewal. And great renewal stems from people taking a risk because things have changed, and normality has changed. And that normality, in a way, is full of risks already, so why not go ahead and direct your own risk, in that regard.” McWilliams concluded by again looking at a work from history. He cited the poem “The Second Coming” by famous Irish literary W.B. Yeats, saying, “The center will not hold, and things will fall apart only if the best people lack all conviction, allowing the worst people to come through and be full of what he called passionate intensity, full of slogans, and dominate the agenda.” McWilliams explained that this is a message of rallying urgency, calling on all leaders to step up and figure out a way through the situation that lies ahead. This, he believes, is how humans have survived adverse periods throughout history, and how we will do so once again. “All these things, this is all part of what I call the great commercial adventure of life,” stated McWilliams. “As long as we put commerce at the center, in terms of the adventure that is commercial adventure, and we protect it, then it's an evergreen urge that humans have, and it will not be defeated.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/3-things-history-teaches-us-about-our-economic-future","title":"\n\n                    3 things history teaches us about our economic future\n                    ","date":"May 19, 2020","contentLength":1481}},{"pageContent":"This year during Alltech REBELation, we would like you to join us in visiting two of Kentucky’s most progressive dairy farms. The first stop: Riney Dairy, LLC in Springfield, Kentucky. Billy Riney and his father have been milking since 1978. Having evolved substantially over time, Riney Dairy now boasts a 350-head Holstein herd and credits a newly installed GEA Double-12 parallel parlor to helping them maintain efficiency and productivity. The Riney operation includes a free stall barn and a compost bedded pack barn. Billy and his son, who is also involved in the business, focus heavily on farm profitability and herd health. The next stop: Kings Hill Dairy in Lebanon, Kentucky. Assuming ownership from his dad in 1986, Bill Mattingly’s Kings Hill Dairy, has been a family-run operation since its inception. Kings Hill Dairy milks 205 Holsteins and manages approximately 600 acres. Recently the Mattingly family began using a compost bedded pack barn for their entire milking herd. This farm provides a great example of Kentucky agriculture with strong family involvement, and is progressively keeping its eye on sustaining the operation for the next generation. A commonality in these two farms is a popular technology that continues to gain traction across Kentucky -- the compost bedded pack barn. Dairy housing systems have a substantial impact on overall health and productivity of a dairy operation. What is a compost bedded pack barn? As Dr. Jeffrey Bewley, Professor of Dairy Sciences at the University of Kentucky and leader in research for these housing systems, explains, “The compost bedded pack barn is a housing system for lactating dairy cows consisting of a large, open resting areas, usually bedded with sawdust or dry, fine wood shavings that are composted in place, along with manure, when mechanically stirred on a regular basis.” Benefits of a compost bedded pack barn Dr. Bewley also said, “Producer-reported benefits of these barns include improved cow comfort, improved cow cleanliness, the low maintenance nature of the system, improved feet and legs, decreased somatic cell count, increased heat detection, ease of manure handling, increased production, increased longevity, low investment costs, less odor, fewer flies, less concern with cow size, and improved manure value.” Finally, in true Kentucky fashion, the tour will end with a stop at one of the top bourbon distilleries in the state – Maker’s Mark Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky. One of the world’s iconic Kentucky-made products, Maker’s Mark sold more than 1.4 million cases of its bourbon whiskey, with distinctive bottles dipped in red wax, around the globe in 2013 alone.

Many of the highlights illustrated Alltech’s Planet of Plenty™ vision of promise, possibility and positivity for the future, which centers on the belief that a world of abundance is achievable, but it will take all of us working together. Leadership is not a title — it is action Now is a time for leadership, both at individual companies and in the agriculture industry as a whole. However, we may need to tweak our idea of what makes a great leader. “Leadership is not a title,” said Dr. Lyons. “Leadership, to me, is an action. You aren’t a leader because you hold a certain position or a certain role. Much as we’ve heard that love is a verb, something active, so is leadership.” He noted that in a crisis, a leader must exemplify three traits: 1. Decision-making 2. Confidence 3. Trust in their people There is, however, one important thing that can undermine leadership: ego. “In a crisis, a leader must put their ego aside,” said Dr. Lyons. “We as leaders must realize that the decisions we are making are impacting so many more people and in much more profound ways during a crisis. In that regard, our personal well-being and our interests must be subjugated to the importance of others’.” Already, we are seeing many examples of people setting aside their differences, coming together and thinking through challenges creatively. These, Dr. Lyons said, are the teams that will win in a crisis. We must listen to the experts An important component of Alltech’s Planet of Plenty vision is the need to listen to our experts, from farmers to scientists to economists, as well as those from many other professions. Even when we do not like the ideas that experts present, it is important that we acknowledge them. “We need to take the time and energy to understand them and, if we agree, put a little more energy in and make sure we can communicate these ideas to a broader audience,” said Dr. Lyons. “Their insights and their ideas often hold the key to not only those new innovations, but the mere survival, at times, of our industry and our society. Making sure that we are giving time to those experts, I hope, will be a legacy of this time.” We could be seeing a resurgence in the public’s openness to listening to experts. Their insights could make all the difference in helping us achieve a more abundant world for everyone. Telling your story, and the story of agriculture, is critical Trust has become the new currency of our time. Consumers are voting for brands that they trust with their money and their loyalty. Brands that showed up during COVID-19 with a strong focus on the environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects of their businesses, from treating their employees well to sustainability, will come out ahead. It is important to tell these often hidden and unrecognized stories of agriculture and to celebrate the unsung heroes who put food on the table for families every day — from dairy operations harnessing cow manure to generate electricity to using insects as a sustainable protein source or farming cattle and trees together. “You, and the stories you tell, are important,” said Dr. Lyons. “Your legacy is part of this whole story, and part of what is at stake. How and why the world is different because of what you do is an important aspect of that story, and it’s possibly one of the most important things you can do. “Sharing your story of purpose is such a powerful thing,” he continued, “not simply because it builds the understanding of others, but it also gives them the right to do the same, and to feel empowered and make a change.” We must unify and take action, today, for the future of agriculture and our planet “We are on a journey, a journey of sustainability, and we’ve learned this week that this is never a destination,” said Dr. Lyons. “It’s something that we will be constantly changing, as we always have.” On this journey, the only way that we can move forward is together. Luckily, at this moment of widespread virtual networking, Dr. Lyons believes a democracy has been created and has fostered an ability to connect across all levels and positions, increasing the spread of information and ideas. The Alltech ONE Virtual Experience illustrates this perfectly, bringing more than 23,000 attendees from 118 countries together, which is roughly seven times the number of attendees previously seen at Alltech’s annual, in-person conference in Lexington, Kentucky. Coming together as ONE team with many ideas represents the best chance we have to make positive change. “If we unify and we take action, we can connect with leaders, we can bring about change,” said Dr. Lyons. “If we don’t, we will look at ourselves at this time next year and say that we missed that golden opportunity. What we need right now is that unified action to make sure that we make this difference and provide for this planet in an even better way than we have in the past, and truly create that Planet of Plenty.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/dr-mark-lyons-unifying-planet-plentytm","title":"\n\n                    Dr. Mark Lyons: Unifying for a Planet of Plenty™\n                    ","date":"May 27, 2020","contentLength":1011}},{"pageContent":"Jerry O’Callaghan brings his extraordinary story to The Alltech REBELation. As a young man he moved from his Irish homeland to Brazil, where, through hard work, persistence and refusing to give up, he became a driving force in the global beef industry. His amazing journey began nearly 20 years ago, when he took a leap of faith and joined what was then a small company, JBS, with the mission of developing its international business. And develop it, he did. Today JBS is the world’s leading animal protein producer, with O’Callaghan remaining a central force in its ever-expanding global rise. Under his leadership, JBS became the first beef company to launch an IPO. Its success has reached into other markets, including pork, chicken, dairy, lamb, leather and biodiesel. Great achievements, however, do not come without risks, trial and error. O’Callaghan has seen every success and failure that can come with animal production, particularly within today’s challenge of feeding a growing global population. All the while, JBS’s efforts have been tailored to minimize environmental impact and to improve the communities in which it operates. No one is better equipped than O’Callaghan to speak on the advantages of partnering with a large-scale, multi-protein company such as JBS. Join us to learn about the opportunities awaiting a progressive farmer or rancher who forms an alliance with a dynamic and globally commercial company, and learn what JBS is doing differently that sets it so far ahead of competitors in the beef industry. O’Callaghan’s talk will provide an entrée to this Beef Symposium rich in networking and opportunity. His take on “The JBS Story: How to become the biggest and the best” will share the strategies that have molded JBS and put it in the leading position it holds today. He will impart tips on finding the right customer for every product and establishing efficient, low-cost operations.

Born on a beef farm in Roscommon, Kevin always had a passion for farming. At the ripe age of 18 Kevin left for New Zealand to pursue a career in dairy farming. In what can be described as a man on a mission Kevin left to follow his dreams, of milking hundreds of cows on a major dairy farm. Unfortunately while in New Zealand Kevin was involved in a motorcycle accident on the farm and subsequently lost both legs. This did not deter him. He returned to Ireland and walked off the plane. From there he started Dairy Business, an Agricultural Science degree in University College Dublin. This is when I met Kevin, he instantly became one of the lads, and I am very proud to call him a friend. His passion for farming and life inspired me. In the summer of 2014 he returned to New Zealand and managed a 900 cow dairy farm as part of work experience for our degree. To return to farming was phenomenal. To return to New Zealand showed massive courage, but to manage a major dairy farm in New Zealand is truly heroic stuff. In the summer of 2014 Kevin organized a road trip to Alltech’s Global Dairy and Beef forum held in Deauville, France and I was lucky enough to be invited along. This involved getting a Ferry from Wexford to England, driving across England and getting to channel tunnel to France. Kevin drove while two others and I enjoyed ourselves, it was truly an unforgettable experience. This week long road trip had it all, from drinking Kentucky bourbon, to talks from world leaders about challenges faced on-farm and included lively debates in an Irish bar (we decided it was Irish because it was painted green) called “The Dickens Bar” with a cork farmer about the optimal system, the problem with fragmented farms and at what price was rented land too dear. I think it’s safe to say we didn’t come to any conclusive answers. Kevin is currently in his final few weeks of college and will be finishing his final exams in 6 weeks. From there the Irish farming community as a whole will get to benefit from his infectious enthusiasm and work ethic. The future is bright for Kevin and I’m sure he will be very successful at farming in the future. Paddy is competing in Alltech’s Favorite Farmer Contest. The photo with the most likes on our Facebook page will win a trip to the Alltech REBELation in Lexington, KY.

Mycotoxins in aquaculture and fish feed is an emerging and an underestimated problem for the industry. What are mycotoxins? Mycotoxins are chemical compounds produced by soil-borne \"filamentous fungi\". These lowly microbes are notorious plant pathogens in cereal crops, while their secondary metabolites, mycotoxins, are dangerous feed contaminants for farmed animals. It is possible for fungi to contaminate cereals in the early stages in the field, or later, during the transportation and storage of the commodities. Their growth, as well as the production of mycotoxins, is climate-dependent. That means that different fungi and mycotoxins bloom in different geographic regions. For instance, Fusarium fungi flourish in temperate areas, and as a result, their corresponding mycotoxin, deoxynivalenol, is highly present. Similarly, in the tropics, the bloom of Aspergillus fungi is often linked to the release of aflatoxin. Unfortunately, the climate change and extreme weather conditions we are now experiencing may alter the fungal community structure and quantity of mycotoxin-producing fungi. Thus, in the coming years, we can expect an unavoidable and unpredictable increased risk of mycotoxins in our fields and agricultural commodities. The hidden threat to farmers The aquafeed industry has made remarkable attempts to develop sustainable fish feeds by reducing the inclusion of traditionally used marine ingredients and replacing them with novel ingredients derived from crops and their byproducts. Thus, the inclusion of plant-based ingredients in fish diets, along with some known nutritional limitations, also introduces a potential exposure pathway for mycotoxins. To our knowledge, corn and its byproducts are the most highly contaminated with mycotoxins, followed by wheat and soybean products. If we consider the industry's long-term goal of reducing the value chain’s dependence on marine ingredients, then we can expect much higher inclusion rates of plant-derived raw materials in aquaculture feeds. Undoubtedly, these higher inclusion rates of plantstuffs, in combination with ongoing climate change, may boost the presence of mycotoxins in fish feeds, making the challenge of keeping contaminants out of fish feed even more difficult for the aquaculture industry. Effects of mycotoxins on fish health and performance Based on our established knowledge from the Alltech 37+ lab database, numerous individual mycotoxins have been detected in fish feed samples. In most cases, more than one mycotoxin is simultaneously present in a feed batch, at unpredictable levels and combination patterns. There are indications that some combinations might have synergetic effects on animals. However, the interactions among mycotoxins that co-occur in the feeds are not well-determined, as most of the research focuses on individual mycotoxins and not their combined toxicity. An additional challenge to unraveling the effects of mycotoxins in aquaculture is the complexity of the industry itself. Fish farming is diverse and can include different fish species with different life histories, physiologies and, as a result, sensitivities to the toxins. The impacts of mycotoxins depend on various factors, including: The type and quantity of mycotoxins in the feed Feeding level The duration of exposure Fish species Sex Age Health The nutritional status of the exposed species The biological effects of the most common mycotoxins (aflatoxin B1, ochratoxin A, fumonisin B1, deoxynivalenol, T-2 toxin and zearalenone) are described below based on studies on mammals. As a result of the developing trend of mycotoxins in the aquaculture industry, scientists are undertaking research trials aimed at evaluating the impact of mycotoxins on fish species. Initial reports of the results are focused on growth trials, indicating that we still have quite a long way to go. Regardless of the type of toxin, reduced growth performance and high feed-conversion ratios are often associated with the ingestion of contaminated feeds. Growth might be affected directly, due to lower intakes of contaminated feeds, or indirectly, due to the molecular damage the toxins induce on the cellular level. In any case, the final output is the same: reduced growth performance for the fish and economic losses for the fish farmers. Unfortunately, mycotoxin contamination is a “silent” enemy for farmers, since most cases are not correlated with visual symptoms. Long-term ingestion of feeds with low levels of mycotoxins or acute exposure to high levels might be a reason for the unexplained mortalities that occasionally are observed in fish farms. The solution Sustainability is our priority, and we feel we have a responsibility to establish and maintain an aquaculture industry that protects farmed fish welfare, helps farmers maximize their profits and creates sustainable products that are essential for consumers to live a healthy balanced lifestyle. To properly manage the mycotoxin risk at the industrial level, it is crucial to examine potential solutions at all of the critical points in the value chain, from the fields to the feed mills. Starting in the fields, good agricultural practices — like growing resistant crop varieties, crop rotation, soil tillage, and chemical and biological control of plant diseases — are recommended. At the pre-harvest stage, mycotoxin contamination cannot be fully prevented, especially during unpredictable weather conditions. Raw material suppliers should implement methods for rapid mycotoxin analyses in cereal products to accept or reject a batch. Unfortunately, these quick tests can only detect a few toxins, and the regulatory limits vary among different countries. Thus, the responsibility of mycotoxin management in aquafeeds is automatically transferred to the aquafeed producers. At this final stage, mold inhibitors are usually included in the feed formulations to prevent fungal growth in the finished feeds during storage. Mycotoxins produced in the pre-harvest stage are still present in the feeds and remain almost stable in high temperatures during the extrusion process. As such, feed producers should consider detoxification feeding strategies in order to eliminate the negative impacts of mycotoxins on fish after exposure. Among different commercially available detoxification products, enzymes appear to have a high selectivity in transforming mycotoxins to less toxic forms. However, this strategy would only be effective if aquafeeds contained just one mycotoxin. In reality, as mentioned previously, a cocktail of mycotoxins is likely to be present in the feeds, and it is not feasible to supplement an enzyme for each potential toxin. As a result, attention is shifting to more practical and universal solutions, such as mycotoxins binders. In general, organic adsorbents bind with a larger spectrum of mycotoxins than the inorganic ones. Overall, effective mycotoxin management is about seeing the whole challenge, from the farm to the feed mill and from risk assessment to feed management. The symptoms can be many and varied, but the outcome in all cases will be reduced performance and lost profits. The Alltech Mycotoxin Management team provides a number of solutions to help you mitigate the threat you could face from field or storage mycotoxins. Speak to the aquaculture team today and find out how you can mitigate the threat of mycotoxins in your feed. Email aquasolutions@alltech.com.

Riders have the opportunity to school each of the horses for three minutes over two obstacles at a maximum height of 1.30m. Riders can change the saddle but the horse must remain in its own bridle, bit and boots. The rider with the lowest total penalties over all of the rounds of the final will be declared World Champion! In the event of equal penalties for first, second and/or third place there will be a jump-off against the clock over the same course but each competitor gets to ride their own horse. Dressage Classical dressage first came to prominence during the Renaissance as it was developed for the Cavalry. There is even some evidence that some of the manoeuvres used in dressage were developed by the ancient Greeks. Eventing The 1956 Olympic Games were held in Melbourne. However, due to Australia’s strict laws, horses entering the country would have had to endure a lengthy quarantine. As a result, the equestrian events were held in Stockholm, Sweden! Although Eventing became an Olympic sport in 1912 only male military officers were allowed to compete. It wasn’t until 1964 in Tokyo that the first woman took part in an Eventing competition. Driving Driving is the oldest competitive equestrian sport. Evidence suggests that horses were driven long before they were ridden. The discovery of the Sintashta chariot burials in the southern Urals show driving dates all the way back to 2000BC. Para-Dressage In the 1952 Olympic Games before Para-dressage was an official discipline itself, Danish rider Lisa Hartel, who was paralysed from the knees down, won a silver medal in Dressage! Endurance Organised endurance riding as a formal sport began in 1955, when Wendell Robie and a group of equestrians rode from the Lake Tahoe area across the Sierra Nevada Range to Auburn, in under 24 hours. They followed the historic Western States Trail. This ride soon became known as the Tevis Cup and it remains one of the most difficult of any 100-mile rides in the world because of the severe terrain, high altitude and high temperatures. Vaulting The youngest competitor at the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games™ 2014 in Normandy is 8-year-old vaulter, Ksenia Ermolaeva from Russia. Reining Reining is often described as the western form of dressage. It originated from the herding of cattle in Mexico and south-western states like Texas and California. The horses needed to be able to move in certain ways for the rider to remain in control of the cattle, movements not unlike those performed in dressage.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/fast-facts-about-8-disciplines","title":"\n\n                    Fast Facts About the 8 Disciplines\n                    ","date":"August 28, 2014","contentLength":463}},{"pageContent":"I remember sitting in the library of UCD one winters day reading about the Alltech Dairy Career Development Programme, and what struck me first off was that, unlike a lot of graduate programmes, this one had structure. Each week was planned out, from what training we would receive, were we would work and what we would be doing etc. Then the plan was that on week 10 we would be on our farms, and do you know what, here I am, on farm. I met with Siobhan in the crazy city of Bangkok and we flew down to Ho Chi Minh City to meet another Alltech employee, Yen. She was very kind and organised my visa and mobile phone. We then travelled to the farm in the Binh Dinh province of Vietnam. The first thing that hit me was the bio-security, it is very strict on this farm, and rightly so as Foot and Mouth is rampant in this country. With 878 milking cows on this plot there is no room for that kind of disease on the farm. Together we carried out a complete farm audit, from the mixing centre to the cows BCS. I was happy to get it completed with Yen by my side as she speaks very good English. The only downside for me is that the farm workers don’t speak a word of English, so no communication goes on but I have to use my initiative and do work that I feel is beneficial to them. For example on Friday I was helping in the calf feeding process. This allowed me to gain a detailed insight into what really goes on from birth, to weaning and then all the way to 70 days of age. I can make my own suggestions in a report about where I feel changes can be made. There is lots of scope for change on this farm but as the saying goes, patience is a virtue, so I will take my time and not try to be a miracle worker. On another note the food is a slight challenge but I am mastering the chop sticks like a pro. The weather is hot, 32 degrees, 80% humidity, it’s extremely hard on cows and calves, but this is one challenge that I know I can help with. I have a good Wi-Fi connection which is brilliant to keep in contact with home, so I am all settled in and the workers are now taking me to a local restaurant to eat god only knows what, so until next week it is goodbye from sunny and sticky Vietnam.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/welcome-vietnam-32-degrees-celsius-80-humidity","title":"\n\n                    Welcome to Vietnam, 32 degrees Celsius, 80% humidity!\n                    ","date":"December 5, 2014","contentLength":440}},{"pageContent":"A recent foreign animal disease (FAD) publication by the National Pork Board reported that African swine fever (ASF) continues to spread through parts of Asia and Europe, increasingly disrupting the world’s pork production. China has garnered much attention due to its position as the top global producer of pork. The World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) stated that nearly all of China’s provincial-level administrative units have reported at least one ASF break, which means that all but the far west of China — including Hong Kong and Macau — has now been exposed to ASF on some level. The presence of the ASF virus has also been confirmed in Vietnam. Adding to those concerns is the fact that Japan is battling classical swine fever (CSF), another reportable FAD. The threat of a FAD in the United States has heightened the need for increased protection for the swine industry at U.S. borders. It has also provoked further discussions on biosecurity and the on-farm steps that must be taken to reduce the risk of disease. On-farm biosecurity At a recent swine production meeting, I discussed on-farm biosecurity and advised taking a strategic approach to prevent both the introduction of new biological agents onto your farm and the uncontrolled movement of pathogens around your farm. Below are critical control points to include in the evaluation of a biosecurity program: Animal entry When are replacement animals brought in? Are transport trailers being washed and disinfected? Are feral swine a concern? Personnel entry Shower-in/shower-out facilities Obeying the lines of separation between clean and dirty zones Product and equipment entry How are deliveries to the farm handled? Are special precautions taken when outside services (e.g., electricians) are used? Pest control Keep premises clean and picked up Regularly check and refill bait stations Mortality management Ensure that mortalities are regularly picked up Feed biosecurity Stage deliveries to clean sites first Disinfect truck wheels and undercarriages, as well as driver equipment Utilize feed intervention technologies to support feed integrity and feed hygiene. Products such as Guardian have been shown to be effective in optimizing feed safety. Outside traffic Limit traffic on your farm Plan an offsite delivery area, if possible Aerosol transmission Isolate infected animals Wear personal protective equipment Secure Pork Supply (SPS) plan A Secure Pork Supply (SPS) plan is being developed through the National Pork Board and the USDA to enhance communication and coordination, accelerate a successful FAD response and support continuity of operations for pork producers. Having an SPS plan in place before the potential outbreak of a FAD in the U.S. is critical for food security, as well as animal health and well-being. The SPS plan addresses the following FADs: Foot and mouth disease (FMD) Classical swine fever (CSF) African swine fever (ASF) You can find more information about the SPS plan at www.securepork.org or through the National Pork Board. The Swine Health Information Center coordinates a global disease-monitoring program and conducts targeted research about reducing the impact of future disease threats.

Finbar is an extremely intelligent man and passed his knowledge onto us in an easily understandable manner. It will be of use to us through the Dairy Career Development Programme (DCDP) and for many years to come. Body Condition Scoring On Wednesday we took a trip along with three of the DCDP members to Christy Reynolds’ farm in Walterstown to body condition score (BCS) his cows. It was an ideal farm for BCS as his herd ranged from fresh cows to recently dry cows. This gave us a good scale to work with. Some of the CDP students were a little put off by the smell, I may add, and when a cow lifted her tail beside Aoife she was not long about moving swiftly away to avoiding getting cow feces on her new wellies. Penn State Shaker Box Finbar walked us through how to correctly BCS cows and then let us assess the selection of cows and take records in order to check our progression. No need to doubt us we got them all correct. Well, so we told Finbar anyway. Colm Duffy was also there and took us through faecal washing using the Penn state shaker to assess how much of the feed is being digested in the cow’s rumen. Learning about IFM and 37+ Thursday and Friday we received a talk from Amanda Gehman who is based in the USA and spearheads the IFM tests and 37+ to name a few. It is good for us to be able to explain to farmers how their feed samples are tested. We were then forced by John to present slides we had prepared on the work we did the week before. Some of us nailed it and some of us didn’t. Well, Amanda nailed it anyway. So we struggled through ours and then out of nowhere John springs a 2 hour assessment on Finbar’s material on us. Ten o’clock and we are still at it, but all is good. We are almost finished and it is the weekend. I have a championship semi-final tomorrow so an early night is on the cards.

Healthy animals are much more likely to perform at their potential and produce more efficiently. The gastrointestinal tract of layers is an ecosystem in which water, pH and bacteria need to be in balance. Setting the stage for this balance soon after hatch and maintaining it throughout the life of the animal is the key to maximizing performance and farm profitability. Digestion in an increasingly plant-based diet The diet for the bird must be made so that it is quickly digested and, in the case of layers, eventually turned into the building blocks of eggs. Yet, today, consumer demands for all-veggie diets complicate efforts to design an easily digestible diet. The grains used to make up the energy and protein in the diet will only release a portion of nutrients after digestion. The rest of the nutrients are bound in the plant cells and can only be released if these plant cells are broken down. Enzymes added to the diet can help to break down these plant cells and allow the grains to release more nutrients to the bird. Generally, enzymes work in a “lock and key” model, in which a specific enzyme can only help to break down a specific compound. Because a poultry diet is complex, more than one enzyme may be needed to help with this breakdown. Preventing bacterial overgrowth How efficiently the feed is digested and absorbed by the bird can affect the bacterial balance in the gastrointestinal tract. Efficient breakdown and absorption of the feed by the bird can reduce the amount of undigested nutrients that reach the lower gut, where a diverse microbial population is concentrated. This is important because, by reducing the undigested nutrients entering the lower gut, we reduce the potential of an environment to be created that supports opportunistic (potentially bad) bacterial overgrowth. Consequently, reducing the undigested nutrients reaching the lower gut helps to improve overall poultry health and performance. Ancient process meets advanced technology Nutritional technologies are available that can support this breakdown of nutrients. Through an ancient process called solid state fermentation (SSF), a selected strain of non-GMO Aspergillus niger works in synergy with the animal’s digestive system to break down layers of the feed that were previously inaccessible through digestion. This exposes more nutrient-rich layers for the animal to digest, such as amino acids, energy, protein and vitamins. Advances in genetics have made today’s poultry more productive than ever. Any bird under environmental stress due to heat, cold, very dry or very humid air could have their feed intake patterns and intestinal tract affected, causing reduced digestibility. However, by paying close attention to the entire management system and to nutrition, poultry growers can respond quickly to challenges and achieve optimal potential.

However, for the calves they are raising, the most stressful period is yet to come. The weaning process is widely recognized to be one of the most stressful stages within the beef system. As an industry, we are beginning to understand that prolonged periods of stress can negatively affect: Overall health Average daily gains Feed efficiency in beef cattle These losses in growth efficiency in stocker cattle also lead to losses in overall profitability. With the knowledge that stress negatively impacts animal health and performance, producers should start focusing on producing resilient calves that can handle the stress of weaning. Developing management practices that focus more on disease prevention is the key to building a healthy, resilient calf crop. Effective preventative health management programs require producers to evaluate their individual production systems to determine what type of health challenges they need to manage and when these challenges will occur. The best place to start implementing preventative health measures is at the cow-calf operation. When it comes to having the most impact on lifetime animal health, cow-calf producers hold all the power. As an industry, we must give great attention to preparing calves for dealing with upcoming stress. We work to minimize the duration and the degree of stress that animals experience during weaning, but these stressors are never going to fully disappear. The question then becomes: How can we manage herds so that they we are producing resilient calves that can handle the stress of weaning? Challenges Managing animal health and production losses in beef calves that are stressed after weaning is a major concern for producers. The stress animals experience during these periods of transition does have consequences, like suppression of immune functions and decreased growth, both of which lead to overall losses in production. One major component of a preventive health management program should be developing a healthy gut prior to weaning. Backgrounding cattle for about 30 days following weaning is an ideal way to minimize stress and straighten out heifer and steer calves before transitioning them to the feedlot. Backgrounding periods are usually forage-based systems that aim to increase body weight through frame growth and muscle development rather than establishing fat. Backgrounding and stocker enterprises present an excellent opportunity to establish a healthy gut before feedlot receiving. Overall gut health is predicated on several factors: Establishing a stable gut bacterial population Maintaining intestinal integrity Promoting healthy immune function A heathy gut is essential for efficient nutrient absorption and immune function. Scours is one gut health issue that is normally seen during the weaning period. Scours is the result of an unhealthy, inflamed gut. The key to a healthy gut is establishing and maintaining a healthy gut microbial population so that the pathogenic bacteria don’t have the chance to overpopulate and cause inflammation. Solutions Preventative health programs should include vaccination protocols developed with your veterinarian and the implementation of low-stress management practices. However, the use of nutritional technologies designed to support and promote gut health are often overlooked when developing health protocols. Bio-Mos 2 is the second generation of Bio-Mos, an industry leader in calf health. Bio-Mos 2 is a mannan rich fraction (MRF) derived from the cell wall of a select strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast. This MRF is a complex branched-manna fraction that has been shown to promote a healthy gut microbial population and optimize growth through research conducted at Alltech’s nutrigenomics lab. How to feed Bio-Mos 2 Bio-Mos 2 was designed to promote a healthy gut, especially during high-stress periods like weaning and feedlot transition. Bio-Mos 2 supplementation can easily meet the needs of a variety of management styles and can be incorporated into multiple feed types. Bio-Mos 2 can be used in pre-weaning creep feed formulations. Ideally, that creep feed would be fed prior to and through weaning to help reduce stress by familiarizing calves to a feed that will be available throughout weaning and minimizing their time off feed. Bio-Mos 2 has also been added to low-moisture tub formulations and preconditioning supplements to help alleviate stress during backgrounding and in stocker operations. Feedlot receiving diets can also benefit from the addition of Bio-Mos 2. Backed by science A study done by the University of Florida looked at how Bio-Mos 2 supplementation affects animal performance during a 52-day precondition period following being weaned. Bio-Mos 2 supplementation was shown to improve average daily gain for cattle from 0.72 pounds per day for the control group to 1.05 pounds per day for the Bio-Mos 2-supplemented group. This improvement in ADG translated to a lower cost of gain with Bio-Mos 2 at $0.73 per pound compared to $1.29 per pound for the control calves.

The affable, charismatic brewer who was featured in the Discovery Channel series “Brew Masters” and who is seen as a pioneering craft brewer, Calagione is well-known and admired in his industry. With his progressive craft brewer-meets-almost Eastern, yogic philosophy, it is easy to see why. He challenges his compatriots to infuse the world with joy rather than negativity, to take the road less traveled and to roam in both the physical and mental sense. Calagione established Dogfish Head in 1995 as the smallest commercial brewery in America, at a time when only one commercial brewery was opening each week. Now, two open per day. He forged his own path, eschewing the prevailing pattern in the United States to simply amplify and perfect traditional European beers. Instead he took his inspiration from the culinary realm, brewing beers with ingredients like raisins and chicory. “Off-centered ales for off-centered people,” became the company tagline. Today Dogfish Head is the 15th largest craft brewery in the country, producing 250,000 barrels per year. “I’m very proud of our scale, but I’m more proud that we achieved it without dumbing down our beers,” Calagione said. So what else does the Columbia University English major–turned-successful brewer have to say to his fellow craft brewers? “Don’t let the tail of money wag the dog of inspiration.” “Don’t be concerned with what the majority of people are doing. Try to find your own path in the world. If it’s a valuable, valid path, people will join you on that journey.” “The most successful entrepreneurs are those who can galvanize people around them to turn their fictitious dreams into reality.” “We have a lot more to gain by helping each other than by fighting with each other.” “Frankly, I don’t want to be influenced by what my brethren are doing.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/brewing-goodness-world-through-centered-ales","title":"\n\n                    Brewing Goodness in the World through ‘Off-Centered Ales’\n                    ","date":"May 20, 2015","contentLength":341}},{"pageContent":"Your primary focus as a producer is providing your calves with what they need to grow into healthy adult animals. To do so, gut health is key. Good gut health allows the calf to efficiently utilize the nutrients in the feed, giving them a strong, stable and healthy start. However, helping a calf meet its true genetic potential is often easier said than done when there’s a battle going on at the microscopic level inside the calf’s gut. Understanding gut health in cows and calves and how to be a more proactive producer regarding your herd’s health will impact the overall efficiency and success of your operation. Understanding gut health in cows and young calves “An animal’s gastrointestinal tract is made up of billions of bacteria,” said Dr. Shelby Roberts, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Alltech Center for Animal Nutrigenomics and Applied Animal Nutrition. “This bacterial population is comprised of both some pathogenic bacteria and other bacteria that are beneficial to the animal. In a healthy gut, these bacteria keep each other in balance. Gut health problems start when this balance becomes offset and the bad bacteria start to outnumber the good bacteria.” For bad bacteria to cause trouble, they must first attach to the gut, where they start to multiply. Antibiotics kill bad bacteria, but they can also kill good bacteria, so taking a different, more proactive approach when addressing calf gut health can be beneficial. “Maintaining the good gut bacteria, while ridding the system of the bad bugs, is essential to promoting gut health,” Roberts said. Good gut health benefits cattle in a few ways, including: The efficient utilization of feed Healthy weight gain Immunity Gut integrity Taking a proactive approach to gut health Traditionally, the gut has been thought of as just another part of the digestive system. However, we also know that it is an active component of the immune system. Considering the dual function of the gut, one way to achieve optimum gut health in calves is to use a feed supplement created to promote good bacteria and support natural defenses. This preventative approach to animal health can help reduce the number of sick calves and, in turn, decrease the amount of antibiotic treatments as well. This can save producers valuable time and money during the busy calving season. Over the last 20 years, Alltech has conducted research trials that have evaluated management practices that utilize nutritional technologies and the effects of those technologies on calf health and performance. Certain high-quality prebiotics, for example, have been proven to positively impact calf gut health. Prebiotics are indigestible food ingredients that selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of microbes in the gut. Establishing strong calf immunity starts with the dam At birth, calves are born with a naïve immune system due to maternal antibodies being unable to pass through the placenta, which leaves calves susceptible to disease. Colostrum, the first milk produced at calving, is one of the most important components of calf health. Colostrum is a calf’s initial source of the antibodies that are essential for protecting young calves until their immune systems are fully developed, which takes 1 to 2 months. Studies of perinatal mortality indicate that 4–12% of calves are born dead or die within 24 hours of birth. Numerous risk factors contribute to higher perinatal mortality rates, including failed antibody transfer from dam to calf, which only reinforces the importance of colostrum and early nutritional management for calves. There are numerous factors that can affect colostrum quality, including the dam’s age, breed and nutrition. Making sure that the dam’s nutritional requirements are being met prior to calving allows the dam to pass along quality stored colostrum to the calf. Better health for improved performance Producers spend a lot of time and money trying to improve the genetics of their herds. Calves that have both strong immune system development and a healthy gastrointestinal tract will be better able to utilize nutrients efficiently and reach their genetic potential. “If we can make calves healthier and reduce the energy they spend keeping the bad bacteria in balance, it should result in better performance,” Roberts explained. The principle of improved gut health for improved performance is best applied during periods of stress, such as weaning and feedlot arrival. These stressful times negatively impact animal health and growth due to exposure to new pathogens and periods of decreased feed intake. Improved performance resulting from increased efficiency can mean more money in the producer’s pocket. This can be achieved through: Improved animal growth (average daily gains) Reductions in calf treatments and morbidities Trials have shown that, without a doubt, enhanced calf health and immunity translate to better growth and gains. “Being proactive with the use of nutritional technologies and establishing a healthy gut could give a producer’s calves the leg up they need to reach their genetic potential,” Roberts said. Bio-Mos 2® promotes a healthy gut Bio-Mos 2® is a second-generation feed supplement formulated to feed the gastrointestinal tract in your cattle, optimizing average daily gains, aiding in calf immune system development and reinforcing a healthy gut microbiome without antibiotics at all stages of production. With a healthy gut, calves can better absorb the nutrients in colostrum, and as they transition to creep feed, they can maximize their potential to achieve big gains and maintain high performance.

Has it fallen into a rut? Fewer and fewer young people are drinking it regularly, and it appears in the dairy aisle as a nondescript mass of white cartons – one brand or variety blending into the next, often sold as a loss leader by supermarkets. Is there anything that makes milk brands special? Mary Shelman, director of Harvard Business School’s agribusiness program, highlighted this issue in the Marketing for Business Growth session, focusing on the Coca-Cola and Fair Oaks Farms Brands partnership that brings to market new premium milk that Coca-Cola believes will revolutionize the milk sector. The company is a giant in the beverage market, beyond just soft drinks, with 20 different billion-dollar brands – including teas, juices and energy drinks. “What’s been happening for the last 40 years is that liquid milk consumption has been in a nosedive,” Shelman said. She added that today, with the array of energy drinks, teas, sparkling waters and more, there is a “proliferation of products that are eating away at this very natural, relatively inexpensive, very healthy beverage. Isn’t it time for a ‘rebelation’ in this category?” Shelman highlighted the “branding roadmap” she recommends for brands to create products that stand out from the crowd. Ag companies have often lagged in this arena, she said. Know your customer Give your product a job Develop your story Stand out from the crowd Get people talking “The traditional way that we built brands is a thing of the past,” she said. “The new citizen consumer is much more engaged in the food they’re buying.” Smartphones have also revolutionized the way people shop, as they can garner information on food or health within seconds while shopping. Coca-Cola, in a recent report, stated it expects its premium Fairlife milk to “rain money” following its extensive marketing efforts – despite the fact that Fairlife milks are nearly twice the cost of traditional milk, said Shelman. The Fairlife line of milk, with the tagline “Believe in better milk,” goes through a unique filtration process that produces milk with 50 percent more protein, 30 percent more calcium, half the sugars of organic milk and is lactose free. In closing, Shelman highlighted three main points: Food is hot right now. There is a great story, but it has to be told in the right way. Because traditional elements of building brands aren’t working, it opens the door for new and creative ways to approach products and for smaller companies to get out and fill the space.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/reinvention-milk-through-coca-cola","title":"\n\n                    The reinvention of milk through Coca-Cola\n                    ","date":"May 19, 2015","contentLength":424}},{"pageContent":"To celebrate World Egg Day, Alltech went in search of some fascinating egg facts. Here are a dozen “egg”cellent facts: Worldwide, approximately 1.2 trillion eggs are produced for eating every year. The average person consumes 173 eggs a year. An average hen lays 300 to 325 eggs a year. To produce an egg, it takes a hen 24-26 hours. Egg yolks are a good source of natural vitamin D. A large egg contains only 70 calories and 5 grams of fat. Yolk color purely depends on the diet of the hen. Eggs provide the highest quality protein, which is necessary to help maintain muscle function and slow the rate of muscle loss. To tell if an egg is raw or hard, spin it! If the egg spins easily, it is cooked. If it wobbles, it is raw. Eggs age more in one day at room temperature than in one week in a refrigerator. As a hen grows older, it produces larger eggs. The hundred folds in a chef's toque (that tall, pleated hat) represent the hundred ways to cook an egg. Egg protein has the perfect amount of amino acids needed by humans to build tissues. It is second only to mother’s milk for human nutrition.

Treating transportation stress in cattle is a challenge, however, the negative health effects incurred by transporting animals can be limited by implementing a number of good management practices. These key steps are simple and can be easily adopted by your operation today. Step 1: Identify your specific risk-factors Some common factors that will increase the effects of transportation stress in calves include animal cramming, excessive trailer movement, heat stress, dehydration, introduction to new pathogens and inadequate receiving protocols. Even though this list may seem long and broad in focus, there are simple steps you can take to drastically decrease each of these risk-factors. Step 2: Incorporate Beef Quality Assurance certifications Once animals are loaded onto a trailer, it is paramount that the truck driver is intentional about how the animals are treated in order to reduce stress. Ensuring that the driver has a Beef Quality Assurance: Transportation Program certification can provide peace of mind that the animals will be handled adequately. Through these programs, drivers learn to avoid common pitfalls like fast starts/stops/turns, become aware of cold and hot temperature concerns, and focus on cattle handling during loading and unloading. Avoiding these stressful behaviors improves your chances of receiving healthy cattle. Step 3: Develop a receiving protocol The risk of transportation stress does not end when the animal is received. While you have less control over managing stress during transport, the risks still remain in the hands of feedlot personnel. The solution starts with implementing a proper receiving protocol that is based on low-stress handling. The calmer and quieter the employees are, the calmer and quieter the animals will be. This can be accomplished by avoiding hot-shot use, not yelling around animals and removing loud equipment (e.g., hydraulic pumps) from the chute area. A Beef Quality Assurance: Stockmanship Program is also available for employees and is highly valuable for training proposes. Step 4: Pay attention to what you cannot see: Internal health While you can limit external stressors such as noises, excessive movement and stressful animal experiences, an often-forgotten risk factor is the internal heath of the animal. The stress of transportation and the introduction to a new environment, new feedstuff and new pathogens will often result in some level of digestive distress. A decrease in feed intake, feed conversion and weight gain may be observed, and the culprit is almost always due to an immune response in the animal’s digestive tract. The digestive system is very complex and can be damaged easily when health is neglected. The cause of this damage can range from temperature changes to new feedstuffs — even to new bacterial populations. Most of these stressors are unavoidable due to the nature of the uncontrollable environment, and thus, preventative measures must be taken. Step 5: Rely on supplements during the transition period At Alltech, we are passionate about improving animal health through digestive and immune protection, correction and optimization. In our beef division, we focus heavily on reducing animal stress to improve overall growth and health, which simultaneously improves your bottom line. This is demonstrated in Select TC, our feedlot product, which aims to relieve digestive stress during the arrival of a newly introduced animal. The gut has a major impact on the rest of the animal, but because we are unable to see it, we often overlook this factor when considering an animal’s potential. When a gut becomes agitated and inflamed from poor feed quality, new bacteria or stress, you will see animal performance suffer greatly. This decrease in performance is due to the level of energy the immune system requires to fight off pathogens, heal the damaged tissues and produce an overall immune response. Utilizing a supplement to help the immune system protect the animal and negate the effects of the pathogens can help the animal transition into a feedlot more effectively. A more effective transition will, in turn, allow cattle to consume more feed and gain more weight without wasting energy on immune functions, increasing your profitability. Select TC is a well-rounded receiving-period supplement with benefits ranging from gut-cell health support to decreasing the repercussions of bacteria and mold in the animal’s body. This product can be fed in many different forms and at various dosage levels depending on your specific operation. Protect your herd from these common pitfalls, which can lead to low-performing animals.

Each step in the life cycle of the plant has its particular needs, but when focusing on the soybean flowering phase, some special care can result in greater yields when the time for harvest arrives. Flowering and fighting stress The flowering phase is an integral phase for soy plants. What happens during this time and how many flowers the plant is able to produce and maintain will determine the ultimate yield of each plant. Much like humans, plants are also affected by and suffer from stress caused by external factors. A lack of rain and excessive heat are formidable enemies for soy and can severely impact the plants’ development and productivity. In order to minimize the damage that can be induced by these stressors, producers should ensure that the crop is in optimal health and is able to remain in good condition. Feed the plant To improve a plant’s stamina and increase its chances of surviving and even thriving, the grower should ensure that the plant is able to receive and use the appropriate nutrients during periods of stress. Luiz Gustavo Floss, a grains consultant for Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay and Argentina, notes that some practices are indispensable for improving plant development and flower retention — factors that impact profitability. “The plant needs to be well-nourished at the moment of flowering to form as great a number of pods as possible, resulting in an increase in production and greater grain weight,” Floss explained. Solutions to protect against stress Providing nutrients and other stress-reducing substances to the plants prior to and during times of stress will help producers reduce their risks during flowering. Agronomist Vinícius Abe, an Alltech Crop Science technical manager specializing in grains, says that these compounds will allow the plant to be better prepared to resist external factors. “These elements are fundamental for the development of the plant,” Abe explained. “Zinc is a good example of one of these essential elements. It’s an enzymatic cofactor that aids in protein synthesis and in the photosynthetic process. But there are also other important nutrients, such as copper, boron, calcium, nitrogen and potassium. These nutrients are fundamental for the proper formation of the reproductive organs, filling of the grains and productivity.” When a plant receives the essential amount of the nutrients, these stress-reducing substances begin to work quickly to stimulate the plant so that it will reach a balanced state and have the ability to perform the necessary functions, especially in the production of amino acids and hormones. “When we apply an amino acid externally, we stimulate internal production so that the soy plant can pass through this phase more balanced,” said Abe. “Some stressful situations, for example, can make these functions become unregulated and will result in the plant having its productivity compromised.” The Alltech Crop Science solutions based on plant extracts and nutrients complexed with amino acids also have a beneficial impact on the quality of soy plants. With the demands for particular protein levels in the international market, the use of these solutions will translate directly to increased profitability for producers. “The improved development of the plant becomes possible when care is taken in the materials that are used, promoting improved genetic expression and productive potential, as well as decreasing the impact of stress factors on the plant,” Abe said. Did you know? The average soy plant will usually have between 300 to 450 flowers, but more than 80% of them are lost due to various factors that create stress in the plant. There are several steps that growers can take in order to help reduce the loss of flowers. These steps include implementing appropriate crop management techniques, like proper fertilizing, spacing, stands, irrigation and the delivery of nutrients such as calcium and boron, which will increase the probability that flowers will remain on the plant and lead to increased pod production. Roles of certain nutrients in soy production Zinc: Important during the formation of chlorophyll; influences protein level. Copper: Involved in the ability of the plant to synthesize lignin. Boron: Integral to the formation of nodes and nitrogen fixation. Potassium: Plays a role in photosynthesis.

Nutritional management of the overweight horse is key – and not quite as simple as some may think. At what weight is a horse overweight? Assigning a specific weight to define obesity in horses is impossible due to differing bone structure and muscling. Instead, evaluating fat deposition over the horse’s body is a better method to estimate body condition. Body condition scoring (BCS) systems have been developed to apply a numerical score to the horse’s condition based on fat coverage over target areas of the body. While BCS systems are subjective, they do provide a systematic method for evaluating body condition. One of the most widely accepted scoring systems is the 1 to 9 Henneke scale, where 1 is extremely emaciated and 9 is very obese. Horses scoring above a 7 on this scale are considered overweight. For more information specific to body condition scoring, you may visit McCauley's dedicated page. Why is the horse overweight? Determining why the horse is overweight can be helpful. Sometimes the answer is as simple as the horse receiving feed when little or no feed is required. Unfortunately, the answer is often much more complicated. Metabolic disorders such as Cushing’s disease, insulin resistance and equine metabolic syndrome (EMS) may predispose the horse to obesity. Some horses carry extra weight simply because they are very efficient at converting dietary energy (calories) to fat. Nutritional management of obese horses Feed should be adjusted according to body condition and season. One of the primary keys to achieving desired body condition is to balance the number of calories consumed with the number of calories used. The number of calories used changes with age, climate and activity level. As a result, the calorie consumption will likely need to change throughout the year to maintain a healthy body condition. Warmer weather means less energy is used to maintain body temperature, and as pastures grow lush and calorie-rich, winter feeding quantities need to be decreased to maintain a healthy weight. If reducing or eliminating feed does not accomplish the desired weight loss, grazing on lush pastures should also be limited. This may be accomplished by splitting time between pasture and stall, using a grazing muzzle or placing the horse in a dry lot and feeding hay. Pastures are often deficient in many trace minerals. A typical trace mineral salt block will not meet the horse’s mineral requirements. If the amount of feed provided is below the minimum requirement, then supplemental vitamins and minerals will be needed. In such cases, vitamin and mineral supplements should be fed daily rather than fed free-choice. When feeding hay to overweight horses, choose mature grass hay. The more mature the hay at harvesting, the lower the digestible calories. Sugar and starch concentrations are usually lower as well. Many metabolic disorders require avoidance of sugars and starches, making mature grass hay the best choice for reducing calorie intake. Horses on a hay-only diet should receive a minimum of approximately 1.5 to 2 percent of their body weight per day. Feeding hay at this rate is essential to maintain normal, healthy gut function and to avoid the development of vices like wood chewing. As always, the hay should be free of dust, mold and other contaminants. Summary Use a body condition scoring system to evaluate the horse’s fat deposition. Reducing caloric intake and/or increasing caloric output is crucial to weight reduction. While calorie restriction is important, the other essential nutrients (e.g., protein, vitamins and minerals) cannot be ignored. For optimal health, the goal is to achieve and maintain the ideal body condition throughout the year. This may require fine-tuning the diet regularly to adjust for seasonality and other factors, such as changes in activity level.

Another year is almost in the books, and there is no rest for pig farmers like you. Before more cold sets in and the snow piles up, there are many areas that need to be looked at to ensure that your pigs stay warm and your barn is ready for the winter. In a recent webinar, swine experts Dr. Brett Ramirez, assistant professor at Iowa State University, and Dr. Leanne Brooks, swine nutritionist at Cape Fear Consulting, shared their tips and in-barn and in-feed strategies to help you prep your barn and pigs for the upcoming winter months. How cold weather affects air quality and pig nutrition The winter cold brings with it new sets of challenges both in your facilities and in the pigs themselves. One of the most common concerns as the weather gets colder is the potential spikes in diseases, such as PED and PRRS. Implementing sound biosecurity measures in your barn and adding feed intervention technologies are key to help reduce the risk of disease. However, barns closing for the winter also means that there needs to be a major emphasis on indoor air quality, as some of the main indoor pollutants, such as ammonia, can negatively impact your pigs and your barn employees. Cold stress in pigs increases the risk of reduced growth rates, health problems, poor reproductive performance and, overall, a diminished return for your animals. Making sure that these challenges don’t have the opportunity to peak during this season and ultimately affect your bottom line should be a major priority. It is essential to look at different factors that affect air quality, including: Housing systems (individual vs. group) Ventilation and air exchange Season Stocking density Nutrition Focusing on air quality and nutrition is key for getting barns ready for the winter. Some of the main pollutants in the barn are ammonia, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrogen sulfide, methane, total and respirable dust, and airborne microorganisms. Together, these pollutants can have a negative impact on your animals, and major health and performance issues can arise if they are not mitigated. How cold stress affects feed intake One of the nutritional challenges that pigs face when experiencing cold stress is an increase in metabolic heat production, meaning they need more nutrients for maintenance, leaving less available nutrients for growth. To compensate for this, pigs increase their voluntary feed intake, which leads to poor feed conversion, greater input costs, diminished carcass quality and an overall negative effect on your bottom line. Why does this happen? The thermoneutral zone for growing pigs is the zone where pigs are at their most comfortable and their most productive, making it easy for them to maintain their body temperature and perform at their optimal level (Figure 1). When the temperature decreases so much that it passes the pigs’ lower critical limit, pigs will experience cold stress. At temperatures under the lower critical limit, feed intake increases and average daily gain decreases. (Iowa State University, Miller 2012) What does ammonia have to do with it? Ammonia is a dangerous gas produced during the breakdown of urea and is a major source of air contamination on swine farms that can negatively impact pig performance. Its harmful effects on pigs include: Reduced feed intake Decreased growth performance Increased risk of mortality Reduced sow reproductive performance Ammonia is formed as excess nitrogen is excreted in urine and feces in the form of uric acid and urea. This becomes a major issue because cold stress affects the pig’s gastrointestinal (GI) tract and leads to poor nutrient intake and feed conversion. When a pig’s GI tract experiences stress, it cannot absorb nutrients properly, leading to vital nutrients being excreted in the waste. In the webinar, Dr. Ramirez focused on ways to make sure your barn’s ventilation system is prepared for the cold weather and Dr. Brooks shared her nutritional strategies to combat cold stress in pigs. Below are some of their tips to help you prep your barn and your pigs for the winter. 7 tips to prep your barn for the winter 1. Check your ventilation system: Static pressure is the driver of ventilation. Check the pressure difference between the inside of the room versus the outside, and make sure that your primary ventilation route (typically, your sidewall and ceiling inlets) are unrestricted. Remember that your doors should not be the primary inlet. Also, check for condensation and leakage, especially in older facilities. A leaky barn can’t be well ventilated in the winter. Adjust your ventilation system based on your environment and the animal feedback. 2. Not all fans are created equal: It’s important to recognize that each fan should be treated differently — and a 24-inch fan in one barn might not have the same effect as a 24-inch fan in another barn. Different factors affect ventilation rates, so adjustments should be made accordingly. It’s also important to know what the maximum static pressure is in your facility. Also, as you start running your minimum ventilation fans more in the coming months, remember to consider your fan’s energy efficiency and the fan air-flow ratio. 3. Keep equipment clean: Severely cold temperatures make it extremely difficult to wash, clean and sanitize your equipment and facilities. Dirty shutters and restricted inlets can negatively impact flow rate, ventilation and air quality in the barn, which, in turn, leads to poor animal performance. Make sure to keep shutters, light traps, intakes and other items clean. 4. Fresh air distribution is critical: Avoid dead zones or cold spots throughout the barn by making sure fresh air is distributed properly. The proper placement and operation of barn air inlets and the use of static pressure are key. Make sure to drive air through your designated inlets and not through cracks in the barn. 5. Insulate cold surfaces: When possible, put material like insulated bubble wrap in front of cold curtains, unused hot weather fans, tunnel doors and other cold areas. This not only helps create a better seal, but it also provides insulating properties to keep cold surfaces that are not as well-insulated as a normal wall warmer for your pigs. 6. Make sure your barn is tightly sealed: The importance of a tightly sealed barn cannot be stressed enough. If the barn is not tight, it will be difficult to ventilate. For example, if the barn has any leakage and/or cracks, fresh air will take the path of least resistance and will go through any major inlet available — and it’s usually not the inlet you intend or expect. The key is to take total control of how and where air enters your barn. 7. Make sure your controller settings are correct: Remember to clean your temperature probes and ensure that they are positioned at the right spot (ex: not too close to the heater or an inlet, etc.). Ensure that you are measuring the right temperature at the right spot of your barn to help better control propane costs. 4 nutritional tips to reduce cold stress in pigs 1. Understand how the environment affects voluntary feed intake: It is extremely important to understand how colder weather will affect feed intake in pigs. Adjusting the nutrient density of your pigs’ diet accordingly is key to making sure that the pigs are getting the nutrients they need for optimal performance as it gets colder. Keep in mind that a lot of your pigs’ diet requirements could be on a grams-per-day basis rather than just a percentage of the diet, so it’s important to know what they’re eating and what nutrients they’ll need as we move into colder weather. 2. Feed pigs ingredients with high heat increments: Provide feed ingredients that, upon being digested by the pig, will result in more heat from the digestive process. This can be achieved by adjusting the amount of fiber in the diet. Fiber has a high increment of digestion, so feeding your pigs more fiber leads to pigs naturally producing more heat as they digest that fiber. However, be mindful of how fiber can impact carcass quality, as feeding high levels of fiber in finishing pigs can decrease carcass yield. 3. Reduce crude protein: Reducing crude protein affects gases and the overall atmosphere in the barn, as the nitrogen that eventually causes ammonia comes from crude protein. 4. Reduce ammonia in pig barns through in-feed additives: Yucca schigidera, which is the base of De-Odorase®, is a widely accepted additive that is scientifically proven to reduce ammonia and its harmful effects.

April 1st marked an important day in Europe for dairy farmers. However this was no April Fools prank. Farmers are no longer restricted by European Union imposed milk quotas. This means that dairy farmers can now produce as much milk as they wish after 31 years so it’s hugely significant. Milk quota was the single biggest constraint to increasing production up until now, however access to land is now mooted to be the next challenge for most farmers. So is this a good thing? With global demand for dairy products increasing by about 3-4% per year efficient and progressive farmers across Europe can now produce milk with greater economies of scale and capitalize on new markets. However, not all farmers are happy as many fear an expansion of EU milk output will flood the market and prices will drop and the less efficient farmers will be forced out of business. There are only a few countries in Europe that are expected to increase milk output. Ireland is the most bullish of these targeting a 50% increase in milk output by 2020. While this seems like a big increase, most of the additional product is going to be traded on the global dairy market. Given that Ireland is a relatively small player with approximately 1.2 million cows currently, it shouldn’t impact much on the global prices, especially in the medium to long term. What will be the impact on price and at farm level now that quotas are gone? Farmers will now continue to milk with many in a position to scale up. It is expected that there will be more ‘price volatility’ owing to competing in the global marketplace with quota removal, however this will level the playing field for all. For 31 years, dairy farmers have had the threat of penalties hanging over them for every liter of milk they produced over their quota allocation. This was quite substantial at 28 c/l. To give an example, Ireland will pay an EU super levy fine of approximately €75 million to the EU for every farmer who produced over their quota paid for. This will be the last super levy many European countries will have to pay so there is massive relief by farmers in general. Progressive farmers across Europe whose business operations have been greatly restricted by this quota system were reported to be having street parties, such was the reaction. Less efficient farmers on the other hand are cautious as the market will dictate the price of milk now and with a projected surge in production to meet growing world demand, the less efficient farmers will indeed be in trouble and perhaps even have to exit owing to profitability challenges. So does this mean more emissions from more cows with more milk production? Research conducted by Alltech ECO2 has shown quite the opposite with the more efficient producers showing lower carbon emissions per liter of milk produced on farm. Indeed Alltech has developed the “Alltech Dairy Assist Programme” which can help evaluate the efficiency of the farm and can assist improvements to feeding regimes and general farm practice to help improve efficiency, profitability and sustainability. So where can I hear more and engage with European dairy farmers and farmers from around the world?

Dry matter at harvest We all know the importance of proper dry matter at harvest. Checking whole plant dry matter for each field is a good first step to having the correct dry matter at harvest. Chopping too early can lower the starch content of the corn silage and impede fermentation, which can also contribute to the environmental issue of leachate. On the other hand, chopping too late (&gt;40 percent dry matter) can lead to a separate set of problems, such as mycotoxins, poor fermentation, yeast production, decreased starch digestibility and a longer window for total starch digestion. If we monitor the seven-hour starch digestibility and ammonia levels of fresh corn silage, it can tell us a lot about how the corn is fermenting. Typically, fall corn silage will be low in both the seven-hour starch and ammonia. As the silage ferments over 240 days, the ammonia levels rise and the starch digestibility increases. Silage inoculants and crop quality We know that inoculants can speed up fermentation and lower pH, thus saving energy for the cow. Inoculants enable us to get into the piles, bags, bunkers and silos even faster than before. Future outlook is strong is this area. Work is being done on combinations of inoculants and enzymes to assist in both starch digestion and fiber digestion, which will serve to further our efficiencies. Inoculants can cater to front end fermentation or feed out protection. Cater your inoculant to your individual situation. Inoculants coupled with a quality mold inhibitor can be the ultimate line of defense against molds, top spoilage and stability issues. Mold-Zap®, a buffered propionic acid, has been the gold standard in alleviating seasonal total mixed ration heating, but very keen dairymen also use it for preventing top spoilage in bunkers, drive over piles and on silage faces. Corn Silage Processing Score Shredlage, a new corn harvesting method for silage, is gaining acceptance. Most importantly, shredlage processing has led to a renewed interest in proper corn silage kernel processing with the choppers many producers already have. With proper corn silage processing, the kernels can be processed down to the new standard of ¼” kernels. The Corn Silage Processing Score (CSPS) is a great testing tool that is run at virtually all the forage labs in the U.S. because it will assess how well the corn silage has been processed. A Corn Silage Processing Score in the 40–60 percent range is common in unprocessed corn silage and can equate to lost milk. Setting a goal of achieving a processing score above 70 percent will help you reduce the corn silage slump and the impacts it has on your herd. Before we get CSPS numbers back, is there another way to know if we are correctly processing the corn silage? A new technique involving “floating” fresh corn silage is getting some attention, and it’s easy to find articles and images of the procedure online. The process is very simple and can be accomplished in the field, right at the chopper, but you will need a sample of fresh corn silage, a 5-gallon bucket and some water. Fill the 5-gallon bucket three-quarters full with water. Take a 32-ounce cup of fresh corn silage and pour it into the bucket of water. Stir it around for a few minutes. Sift out the fiber particles that float to the top. Dump the water and be sure to save the kernels. Inspect the kernels to ensure that most of the kernels are quartered. The old concept of “nicked” kernels being sufficient is now antiquated advice. Monitor the back end It is a dirty job, but someone really does have to do it. Manure can tell you a lot about how things are working inside the cow. It’s worthwhile to consider a couple of tools that have been around for a few years. The Penn State Particle Separator has been used for years to monitor fiber levels in the diet. The particle separator’s “messy” cousin, the manure screen, can tell you just as much, if not more. The true value of manure screening is monitoring over time and with ration changes. With the transition to new crop corn silage, you can see the impact of the new feed. Many times with new crop corn silage, you will see the kernel remnants in the middle screen and fiber changes in the various screens. Benchmarking your manure screens is a great approach because it will enable you to see what the rumen is doing and you can make ration adjustments quicker than if you use a paper-only approach. While we are messing around with the manure, there is yet another tool that is underutilized, and that tool is fecal starch. Fecal starch testing is done at most commercial feed labs and can tell you a lot about kernel processing and starch digestion, so it can help you to confirm your CSPS scores and the level of starch digestion. Your goal should be to keep the fecal starch under 3 percent, even though you can commonly see the levels initially rise with new crop corn silage samples. Aiding in the new crop silage transition Some of the undigested corn can bypass the rumen and cause hindgut fermentation, which can lead to indigestion and rumen upset. The starch-digesting enzyme Amaize® and certain strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae can assist in breaking down starch and maintaining a proper rumen environment. Additionally, we know that soluble protein and ammonia levels are at lower levels in fresh corn silage. Products that assist in adjusting the rumen degradable protein levels can help jumpstart the rumen microbial production and assist in starch and fiber digestion. Optigen® can help fuel the rumen in the absence of good new crop soluble protein and ammonia levels. Don’t feed it, but if you must… Ultimately, the best way to reduce the fall corn silage slump is not to feed it. It may be frustrating to receive that advice, but it remains true. Starch digestion is often slow, and new crop corn silage should be given three months to properly ferment. Obviously, the longer the fermentation, the better, but there should be a plan in place to have a few months’ carryover of your corn silage crop. When we must feed fresh corn silages, the tools discussed above can help to reduce the corn silage slump.

It attempts to answer the question of which is more important: genetics or environmental influences? The growing field of epigenetics serves to explain that while we are somewhat pre-programmed by the DNA we receive from our parents, the different ways in which that DNA is expressed differs from person to person based on environmental factors such as nutrition, exposure to toxins and lifestyle. As it turns out, a number of diseases have both genetic and environmental connections. Type 2 diabetes, obesity, coronary heart disease, Alzheimer’s disease and cancer have all been associated with both genes and lifestyle. For example, the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease are: Age Family History High Blood Pressure Diabetes High Cholesterol/Triglycerides Poor Diet Overweight & Obesity Physical Inactivity Tobacco Use Stress While genetic factors and age play some role in heart disease, the remaining risk factors are associated with lifestyle choices. In fact, almost 90 percent of cardiovascular disease risk is based on lifestyle factors like poor diet, inactivity, tobacco use, stress and their associated outcomes – diabetes, obesity, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and inflammation. The link between nutrition and disease is hard to ignore. Overconsumption of calories and underconsumption of key nutrients contributes to chronic inflammation in the body. Dietary components and diet-related genes can play a role in the onset, incidence, progression and or/severity of chronic diseases by either increasing or decreasing inflammation. Proper nutrition is the most effective and affordable method to prevent chronic disease and positively impact health outcomes across the lifespan. Integrative approaches to the study and prevention of chronic disease will provide a better understanding for how diet affects the balance between health and disease, because neither nature nor nurture alone can explain the processes of human health or disease.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/nature-vs-nurture-vs-nutrition","title":"\n\n                    Nature vs. Nurture vs. Nutrition?\n                    ","date":"September 3, 2014","contentLength":313}},{"pageContent":"Ammonia concentration can have a direct effect on water quality, especially in ponds fed with high-protein aquafeed. Water quality management is one of the essential management tasks in aquaculture farming, and daily or routine water quality measurement and recording have become some of the critical success factors in ammonia control in aquaculture farming. When optimum water quality is being maintained, the better the growth performance that the farmers will reap. Based on the water quality record, farmers can take necessary corrective actions to improve the pond water quality, including the application of some chemicals, probiotic or mechanical aerations or water exchange. The water quality parameters monitored depend primarily on the culture system and sensitivity of the aquatic animals to particular water quality parameters. Many parameters can directly affect ammonia’s toxicity. Water quality parameters measured by most farms are: Dissolved oxygen (DO) pH Temperatures Total ammonia nitrogen Salinity Effects of ammonia in pond aquaculture Among all the water quality parameters, ammonia is considered one of the toxic substances that requires more careful monitoring within the culture system, as it can cause stress and damage to gills and other tissues. Ammonia is a major waste product of aquatic animals, resulting from the breakdown of feed and other organic matter that is excreted into the water. Ammonia can occur in two forms: unionized form ammonia (UIA)(NH3+) and ionized ammonia (NH4). Unionized ammonia is toxic to fish and all aquatic animals, and its concentration can be elevated by increases in pH and temperature (Table 1). pH has a greater impact on ammonia toxicity compared to temperatures, so it is imperative to test pH while measuring the total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) level to understand the actual risk to aquatic animals. Ammonia in water is dynamic during the day and throughout the whole culture period. Farmers seldom report cases of high mortality caused by high ammonia levels, but they cannot be ignored, as these hidden performance indicators could cause a severe financial loss. These consequences include: Reduced appetite Increased susceptibility to bacterial infections Reduced growth rate Poor feed conversion ratio (FCR) Safe concentrations for long-term exposure are around 0.015–0.045 for coldwater species and about 0.05–0.15 for warm water and marine and shrimp. In the actual farming environment, aquatic animals are not usually exposed to extremely high ammonia levels for extended periods. Therefore, understanding and applying the safe concentration level for long-term exposure to ammonia would be the most practical approach for farmers. TAN must be kept low throughout the culture period to optimize the performance. Table 1: LC50 concentration (Bloyd 2018, reported the LC50 concentrations (concentrations required to kill 50% of test animals) Managing ammonia in pond aquaculture Using water testing kits is a well-established standard practice for measuring the TAN at farm level. This is a process completed once per week. However, common misunderstandings on the control of ammonia, and management practice requires further attention and clarification. Practically, measuring ammonia only once a week should be sufficient. But, bear in mind that where there is higher biomass (higher stocking density), or at the growing stage or near the harvest stage on the culture cycle where the feeding rate is high, there are possibilities of high nitrogen input into the system caused by uneaten feed and/or more feces from growing animals. Ideally, it is recommended to take a water sample and TAN test twice per week during the last phase of the growing stage or near the harvest stage. This helps in monitoring whether TAN is in the right range and managing the feeding rate accordingly. During the culture cycle, when the pond water plankton is not stable, allowing for a high fluctuation of pH in the pond water, the TAN testing should be applied to check the UIA level. UIA will increase along with the pH in pond water. It is essential to perform the TAN test along with a pH test for the most accurate results. There are several ways to rectify the high TAN in the waters: Water exchange is often the preferred choice if there is abundant clean and treated water available. However, high daily water exchange is not a sustainable practice, and it could lead to high-risk exposure to the pathogen, especially under the disease threat of surrounding farms. Increased aeration is believed to accelerate the diffusion of ammonia gas from pond water to the air. However, some research has shown that this can, in fact, increases ammonia concentration in intensive systems. Reduce feeding rate Routine application of probiotics in pond water could help. However, when there is an ammonia spike, this probiotic may not act rapidly enough to reduce the ammonia level. Zeolite (only applicable in freshwater). How to reduce ammonia levels in fish ponds In nature, the Yucca Schidigera plant grows in the desert. Its bioactive component can absorb or bind the ammonia found in water, reducing ammonia pollution (Figure 1). De-Odorase® from Alltech is a product containing yucca plant extract. Traditionally in agriculture, De-Odorase is added into animal feed to keep manure odor and ammonia at levels conducive to maintaining respiratory health. This creates a healthier environment, not only for the animal but also for the producer. Figure 1: Yucca trees at Alltech Serdan, Mexico. De-Odorase can be applied directly to the pond water in aquaculture to effectively reduce ammonia levels in the water with no adverse effect on the aquatic animal. This is widely accepted and considered as a safe product for aquaculture farmers, who can routinely apply it to the water to maintain safe ammonia levels. Local trials in Indonesia have demonstrated that De-Odorase to reduce the TAN in water within 1.5 hours, but also maintain this reduced level long-term (Figure 2). Figure 2: Application of De-Odorase (0.3ppm) in Asian Seabass Hatchery The correct dose and proper management practices are the essential elements in achieving lower TAN levels. The right dose of De-Odorase contains sufficient yucca extract to ensure the rapid binding of ammonia without delay. The correct application requires adding the right ratio of water with the Deodorase powder to create the correct volume of yucca solution to use in all areas of the pond. However, it is important to note that De-Odorase is not just a one-time solution for solving all issues relating to ammonia. It is equally crucial to improve management practices, such as reducing the feeding rate and turning on the aeration. If normal feeding is resumed before reaching a safe ammonia level, the levels will rise again. The uneaten feed, due to the reduced appetite of the aquatic animals induced by high ammonia levels, will contribute to bringing the ammonia back to the aqueous system. Prevention is always better than treatment, and this concept is applied to water quality management in aquaculture too. Maintaining a well-managed water quality maintenance program will ensure the ammonia levels are consistently at a safe level for the aquatic animals, while also providing a sustainable solution for long-term benefits. Optimal water quality parameters and their variations across the culture cycle should be understood, and a management action plan should be in place to achieve increased productivity.

It is time for us all, as an industry, to adopt new strategies and learn to co-exist with new norms. This will, no doubt, be a test for each stage of the food chain, but there are some long-term approaches that the industry can take to help increase our profitability and sustainability. The ultimate objective for producers Without a doubt, the most important goals for producers in the aquaculture industry are to: Produce healthy fish in the most sustainable manner. Reduce the use of marine ingredients. Aim for increased growth. Reduce operational costs. Attempting to improve weight gain and lower the feed conversion ratio (FCR) puts increased pressure on the digestive tract to function with the highest efficiency. Considering this, maintaining the health and welfare of fish and shrimp will still be critical for efficient production. Stress from the rigors of production, disease resistance, age and feed, combined with external factors — such as temperature, salinity and pH — can cause imbalances in the gut, potentially leading to disease. Diets in the aquaculture industry have changed significantly over the last number of years and will continue to be modified and improved. From a sustainability perspective, there is an ever-growing need to reduce fish meal and fish oil in aquaculture feeds. Feed ultimately provides energy and nutrients to support the development of the species. Providing the correct balance of feed is crucial for protecting against foreign pathogens and is critical for the system to function optimally. Formulations must be highly digestible, and each ingredient must add value to and enrich the diet to impact performance. As feed ingredients are derived from several different sources, significant planning, research and development can lead to more sustainable, economical and responsible feed solutions. When considering any change to an existing diet, the nutritional requirements of the species must be met. Each aquatic species has a different set of nutritional requirements, and they can fluctuate depending on their stage in the lifecycle. Aquafeed is comprised of a selection of natural feed ingredients, including: Essential amino acid sources Essential fatty acids Vitamins and minerals Imbalances in the diet will lead to a lack of required nutrients, which will have a direct impact on the performance and welfare of farmed fish. The gut is the key to success To fully protect fish and shrimp for long-term success, protecting them right from the start is crucial. Their first point of interaction with outside world — the skin, gut and gills — play a vital role in protecting the animal against the environment and its internal physiology. The gut is a complex system of tissues and organs that play an essential role in all interactions related to these functions: Food digestion and absorption Metabolism Defense mechanisms Immune response An unhealthy gut cannot defend itself. A healthy gut, on the other hand, can digest and absorb the maximum amount of nutrients, providing the most benefit for the farmer. Importance of maintaining and improving gut integrity Choose the correct selection of ingredients to prevent gut inflammation. Increase the growth of good bacteria. Create a solid foundation for health and growth. The use of mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS) in diets has been shown to improve gut performance. However, their function can be altered depending on the strain of yeast, the fermentation conditions and the processing methods. Recent trials carried out with trout, carp, catfish, tilapia, seabass, sea bream, sole and salmon show the effectiveness of MOS in aquaculture species, promoting a healthy growth rate and improving intestinal morphology. The effects of different concentrations of dietary MOS in carp (Cyprinus carpio) included higher weight gains as well as improved FCR, productivity and immune parameters (Zhou and Li, 2004). Improvements in growth performance and reduced FCR and mortality have also been observed in MOS-treated juvenile common carp (Culjak et al., 2006) and rainbow trout (Staykov, 2007). Similar results have also been observed in European seabass (Torrecillas et al., 2006; Ramirez et al., 2016). Bio-Mos® is a unique product derived from a selected strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast using a proprietary process developed by Alltech, Bio-Mos is incorporated into animal diets to support overall animal performance. Effective during all phases of growth, Bio-Mos is designed to feed the gastrointestinal tract, thereby maximizing performance and profitability. Bio-Mos has been shown to maintain gastrointestinal health and integrity, contributing to increased growth and lower FCR. It has also displayed an ability to increase the absorptive surface area supporting the immune system, and stimulating the natural defenses and health status of the animal. The inclusion of Bio-Mos in the diet improves gut morphology by increasing the microvilli density and length, leading to an enhanced absorptive surface. A report completed by Dimitroglou et al. (2007) demonstrated the effects on the gut morphology of several species. Similarly, in European seabass, an increased number of folds was noted, indicating a larger surface area for nutrient management (Torrecillas et al., 2015). More and more fish farmers around the world are finding that including Bio-Mos and Actigen in their strategic feeding programs provides a successful and cost-effective solution to their animal health problems. Getting this aspect right as early as possible in the production cycle will ultimately benefit fish performance in later life. Reducing costs will always be an important element in the viability of any farmed species; however, it is clear that the positive impact of solid gut health will affect production and performance and help mitigate the challenges faced by farmers worldwide. Providing fish with quality nutrients, backed by innovative technological solutions based on sound research and development, plays an important role in ensuring financial success.

Speaking at the Alltech ONE Virtual Experience, Shrirang Sarda, CEO of the Sarda Group shared with our audience how an engagement-based perspective of doing business in India has worked for his dairy venture, Sarda Farms. About Sarda Group and Sarda Farms The Sarda Group began 99 years ago as a startup with three workers producing inexpensive cigarettes. Now, Sarda Group is one of India's most reputable firms, with more than 25,000 team members across six verticals. Its diverse business includes Sarda Farms, a pioneer in the dairy industry in India. Sarda Farms has differentiated itself based on quality and delivers antibiotic-free, hormone-free milk in glass bottles directly to customers’ doors. This project is the brainchild of Shrirang Sarda, who grew up in the business, getting involved in the IT department from the eighth grade, and then succeeding his father as CEO at the young age of 25. He has continued the successful growth of the business, moving into new markets and a new age. Insights The dairy venture started in the late 90s, early 2000, as a part of the company’s vision to diversify. At first, it seemed like a good opportunity to make profit. However, there was discomfort with the quality of the product. Ten years later, Sarda reassessed the business, and his criteria for choices were more refined. The company developed a more institutional view as an organization; its vision was clearer. “It was more about fulfilling a need in the market — or need in the environment, actually, more than a market — and rather than just chasing market share,” noted Sarda. “And that kind of helped us not see it as an exploitative opportunity but more as an exploration of what can be done, what needs to be done. It’s evident that engagement really matters.” The company started to recognize the importance of engagement. It observed that in the areas of business where it underperformed, it lacked an element of engagement. Goals, strategy and results There were several gaps in the market to be addressed through an engagement-based perspective: 1. The whole supply chain was not optimized: Cold chain was non-existent in the first and the last mile of transportation. As a result, the milk coming into the dairy processing unit and the milk going to the house both had high bacteria loads. 2. There was a lack of high-quality milk: “Good milk was simply not available in India,” stated Sarda. “Even in 2010, nothing was right about the market and the product we looked at in the dairy business. The milk quality was just not right. Every household in India, virtually, boils the milk as soon as they receive it because the bacterial load is so high.” 3. There were many fundamental structural challenges: This is from the cow's productivity to feed sourcing to traceability of the milk. “It is also very easy to make spurious milk in terms of just drink the brand name of somebody else and add a white liquid and sell it,” said Sarda. 4. There was no service orientation: According to Sarda, this is a very large category, but there was no service, even though home delivery was available in most places in India. “So, some sort of an agenda began to form in our heads based on the gaps we saw in the market,” said Sarda. The mission became clear: to produce good milk and provide a good service for India. This was not an easy or inexpensive task. The milk quality depends on several factors, including how the milk is produced, packaged and delivered. This is where engagement came in to play through different facets: Milk quality: Sarda aspired to the EU or the U.S. standards, which were not met in India. “[Global standards] need not be the whole market, but it certainly should be a choice in India.” In the end, he used the European family farms model as a benchmark, as the corporate farms model in the U.S. was too large for them to apply to India at that time. Environmental and food safety needs: Packaging: Sarda Farms started using glass bottles because they are blemish-free, do not react with the milk and are reusable and environmentally friendly. Furthermore, it is easier to see if glass has been tampered with, so the consumer can be assured of the quality. Testing: Sarda Farms used engagement as a basis of transaction to substitute for the lack of institutional arrangements. “We do this in our own farms, simply because that institutional arrangement is missing,” said Sarda. “And we can't just send it to a lab and get it tested.” Supply chain: Sarda shared that “one big thing in this agenda that emerged for us was this whole idea of education of all the stakeholders and all the different elements that we interact within the supply chain.” Improving farm management: A farm manager from Holland was hired to make sure best practices from developed markets came to India. “And one side note here is, obviously, Alltech was hugely instrumental in educating us in turn,” said Sarda. “And we got a lot of technology transfer done to us and a lot of knowledge transferred onto us through Alltech.” Silage: Timely delivery was required so that silage can be made. Silage was not a common practice then, but it was important for Sarda Farms to have the right kind of maturity and synchronization of plantation dates across farmers. Cold chain: Because the need for cold chain was obvious, a cold chain was put in place even though it costs a lot more money. Delivery guys were required to understand the importance of cold chain in transportation, to the extent of what temperature is desired. Home delivery: This was a new element in India's dairy market, which worked well before and after COVID. The pandemic did not only increase awareness of hygiene and demand for higher quality, traceable milk, but also enhanced appreciation for milk delivery during the lockdowns. Customer needs: The target market segment was identified as the discerning customer, someone who would appreciate the added value and be willing to pay more for a premium product. “The reason? So, because all these costs were stacked, if somebody did not value this offering, it would seem an extravagant or very luxury kind of offering, whereas we saw it as the bare necessity of having good milk,” explained Sarda. “And somebody who did not value it would think it too expensive.” The strategy was to start with early adopters to establish a higher quality choice in the market, then influence the rest of the market later. Despite being a small size business with no familiarity or experience in the industry, Sarda Farms has made a significant impact in India's dairy industry by addressing the gaps in the market and being engaged with customers and suppliers. “We’re only 10 years old,” said Sarda. “But we certainly have seemed to establish a new kind of offering and a new kind of choice in the market.” Indicators of success Sarda noticed changes in Indian regulation, copycat products in the market, and business opportunities during COVID times. Stricter institutional regulations for quality: “We've seen some changes in regulation in India,” noted Sarda. “Maybe not as much as we'd like to see, but some changes which are in the right direction. They're making it more stringent. Some new parameters have been added.” Appearance of copycats: Sarda shared that the biggest indicator showing they are doing well is that “many, many, many \"me-too\" products have been launched. And many people seem to be jumping on this good milk, farm-to-home model.” Trust and quick response time from suppliers and partners: Sarda Farms has conceptualized and launched three different products, all post-COVID. Sarda credited this success to the trust-based ecosystem, in which suppliers and partners rose to the occasion, and negotiations can come after delivery. The high-end trust was a result of Sarda Farms’ good reputation and relationships with suppliers and partners. Word-of-mouth marketing: “Our experience has shown that if somebody tries our milk for a month, we have more than a 75% conversion rate at a reasonably premium-priced product in India,” explained Sarda. “And these are people who are not necessarily even seeking to buy a premium milk, but they know that they're unhappy with the milk they have. There are children at home, or there's somebody senior at home, or there is a patient at home suffering from some health issue or the other, and they need to get high-quality milk. And they look for it, and they ask their friends. And their friends refer us, and it has worked really well for us. It also gets us the right kind of people, who care about milk, instead of putting customers in some sort of a sales pipeline, where you may sell to them on the wrong basis. So, we are very clear that we want people who appreciate what we do, who value what we do, and the rest is easy. In a very B2B environment, I think it kind of works the same way, especially in an engaged business. But we wanted to do the same in a B2C environment.” The key learning Looking back on Sarda Farms’ journey for the past 10 years, Sarda believed engagement is a big part of Sarda Farms. “And that engagement seems to be the big reason why we're punching above our weight in this category,” Sarda said. “We're a teeny, tiny player. And despite our really small size, we've gotten disproportionate publicity, we've got a disproportionate position in this market, and we've got an extraordinary number of copycats. So that, to my mind, tells me that our impact is very high, despite our size. And I believe the real reason is engagement and how engaged and responsive we've been.” Future implications Sarda offered his insights and ideas to better cater to current and future consumers: 1. Create new products in response to customer needs: Sarda told a story of how his customers called to say they did not get unsalted butter in Bombay and asked Sarda Farms to make it for them. “And we had no idea how that was made or what kind of shelf life we would get. But within five days, we made the first batch of unsalted butter and sent it to the customers to try and give us some basic feedback on. And then eventually, a product was done.” Similarly, they created a new ghee product (stratified butter used in India for cooking) purely based on customer demand for high-quality ghee. “We are not too keen on doing product, per se, but we will do them if the customers so require.” 2. Pay attention to the shift in consumption habits: Sarda asserted this will happen in the larger food sector as well as the dairy industry. According to his entrepreneur friend, India can be segmented into three buckets: India One (about 22% of India) is everybody who has domestic help at home, whether part-time or full-time. India Two (about 50% of India) is the people helping India One, such as drivers, maids, cooks, restaurant staff. India Three is somebody else, like construction laborers and beauty workers. India One is growing at a rate of 1% each year, which is a big growth in terms of the number of people. Interestingly, the children of India Two will likely grow up to become India One. “To us, that was very attractive, that we saw India One fundamentally changing habits, becoming more demanding about what they wanted, in terms of how they see movies to what kind of food they consume to what kind of digital experiences they want or don’t want,” commented Sarda. This is why Sarda is determined to cater to the present and the future by providing acceptable standards of milk and dairy, as well as the herd’s health and productivity in India. 3. Experiment and apply on-farm technologies Experiment on becoming a sensor-driven farm: “We experimented with a full range of sensors, for example, an ammonia sensor, which will detect if the farm is clean or not,” said Sarda. Sarda Farms also started with cow motion sensors. For example, to ensure animal welfare, they use an activity monitor for notifications of stresses from the cow. “When a cow is no longer productive, we ensure they go to a cow sanctuary where they can live the rest of their life in a relaxed way.” In addition, Sarda sees a lot of need for using newer hardware for sensors “to get the milk even more right and get the cow care even more right.” Applications on-farm, logistics and retail: On-farm, they are increasing the autonomy of the cow and calf. For logistics, they are looking at Bluetooth sensors for cows and thermal inks on their packaging to detect temperature quality. In retail, they are focused on engaging with and understating the shopper. Applications for sustainability: “Our entire farm runs completely on biogas energy,” said Sarda. “We also try to minimize and avoid plastic use and have optimized our routes to minimize distances traveled. We also strive to get the maximum efficiency from feed.” 4. It’s not just about technology: “We are also sensing that it's not just about tools and technology, but it's really about behavior,” Sarda noted. “And if you don't have the right practices and the behaviors in place, there's only so much that technology can help. And there's only so much that you can expect from the technology. So, at the moment, we are very focused on getting the analytical part going in the dairy business.” Final thoughts “I think challenges have always been there,” Sarda commented. “Epidemics have always been there. And certainly, in the short term, there is a fair amount of misery that comes in certain amounts of periods. There is this really wise, age-old saying — I believe it originates from Gautama Buddha — that this too shall pass and that nothing is permanent. “And I see a lot of good signs. In India, for example, we had a huge problem of migrant laborers returning home in these COVID times, and the amount of compassion and empathy generated in India was unprecedented.” To Sarda, COVID is a short blip, and we should continue to stay focused on what we can do, how we can solve problems and how we can contribute.

I saw the hours the farmers in the community put in, and the blood, sweat and tears that went into their livelihood. I vowed at a young age, that I would never, no matter what....marry a farmer. Fast forward 20 years, and I did exactly that. The things I see now with the blood, sweat and tears are totally different than I imagined. There is certainly blood. The blood I saw as a kid was the blood shed in an accident, but the blood I see now is running through the veins of my four amazing kids. This is the same blood that is pumping through the veins of the amazing members of my family's farm. There is absolutely sweat, but I would not have it any other way. Without the toil of their hard work, the life we live would be completely different. The tears my husband and his family shed are tears of joy, tears of love and tears without the negative and salty connotations. As the wife of a farmer, you would think I would feel obligated to say that my husband Kevin is my favorite farmer, but that is just simply not true. Without the patience, love, hard work and nurturing that his father before him put in (and still puts in) my husband would not be the man he is today. He would not know the value of hard work and the importance of a Sunday. My kids would not understand what it means to put everything they have into something. They would not understand that a bad crop or a poor year farming does not make a bad farmer. My favorite farmer is Kenny DeDonder, and never in the ten years I have been a part of his family, or in the next 100 years will I ever be able to describe to him how grateful I am to him. Thanks, Kenny, for everything. Misty is competing in Alltech’s Favorite Farmer Contest. The photo with the most likes on our Facebook page will win a trip to the Alltech REBELation in Lexington, KY.

This has put pressure on the livestock sector to maximize output while reducing the usage of resources, making animal feed the largest and most important component in the industry to provide healthy and sustainable animal protein. One of the biggest challenges for the feed industry and animal nutrition is the rising cost of feed, which can account for up to 70% of total production expenses. Furthermore, around 25% of the available nutrients cannot be fully utilized by the animal due to anti-nutritional factors in the feed, which could be costly for the global livestock industry. Today, the greatest challenge for the nutritionist in the feed industry is reducing this indigestible fraction and maximizing feed efficiency based on nutritional and economic factors, which often vary and may be unique to each production system. Improving animal and feed performance with feed innovation Scientific innovation is critical for the future of animal nutrition and protein production. Some key areas of focus for the global animal feed industry to improve animal and feed efficiency are: Improving animal performance characteristics (e.g., feed-to-weight-gain ratios, smart feed for more nutritious animal products) Minimizing costs (e.g., less expensive base ingredients, more efficient utilization of grain for feed) Maximizing feed production efficiencies in a sustainable way (e.g., processes and practices) While traditional feedstuffs continue to be used at high rates, new and novel feedstuffs are now routinely implemented in animal feed formulation. A range of innovative applications are being used to optimize and assess the continued development of efficient and sustainable advances. Advanced technologies, such as nutrigenomics, reveal the relationship between feed nutrients and gene expression. Nutrigenomics allows the industry to identify feeds that can help animals reach their genetic potential by directly impacting the genes responsible for growth rate, meat quality and disease prevention. Another technology that will allow for the prompt characterization of the nutritional value of raw feed materials is in vitro digestion modeling. These models, which can be used for both poultry and swine, provide real-time decision-making options to maximize feed usage while also improving animal production. A third area of feed innovation involves providing supplemental feed that contains exogenous enzymes, also known as feed enzymes, which aid digestion by promoting the release of nutrients that are typically unavailable to the animal, improving animal performance in a sustainable way. The role of enzymes in the feed industry Enzymes, which are essential for life, serve a wide range of functions and are especially important to the feed industry, thanks to their ability to break down nutrients. Enzymes are naturally occurring catalysts that speed up the rate of most chemical reactions that take place within cells. Enzymes play a key role in the animal’s digestive process. Although digestive enzymes are produced by the animal itself — or by naturally occurring microbial organisms in the animal’s digestive system — producers have also used exogenous feed enzymes for many years for nutrient utilization and improved performance in animal feed. Using poultry nutrition as an example, feed substrates and enzymes can generally be thought of in three ways: Naturally produced endogenous poultry enzymes in the digestive tract of the bird for the liberation of nutrients from feed components, such as starches, proteins and lipids Exogenous enzymes not native to the animal’s digestive system that act on recalcitrant substrates, which are not easily digested but which could potentially be utilized as nutrients, such as the glucose in cellulose in poultry diets (e.g., use of cellulase enzyme in poultry nutrition) Exogenous enzymes not produced by the animal’s digestive system that could act on difficult-to-digest substrates, as well as any anti-nutritive effects, due to compounds such as β-glucans, xylans and phytate (e.g., phytase enzyme in poultry feed) Performance and profitability are often the primary reasons for utilizing feed enzymes, as they are the direct result of the improved digestibility and the increased availability of nutrients like phosphorous, carbohydrates and amino acids and, in turn, an increase in available energy as well. However, feed enzymes also allow for the use of a broader range of feedstuffs, which can allow for flexibility in the formulation of the diet by using non-conventional sources or alternative raw materials. These alternative sources are a direct result of the growing demand for corn, wheat and soybean meal. The increased demand for grains has also increased their value, leading feed producers and nutritionists to look for alternative feedstuffs to reduce costs. Non-conventional dietary sources, however, might not be as readily digestible, as the animal may lack the necessary endogenous digestive enzymes and, as such, will glean less nutrition from the feed. The utilization of exogenous enzymes to make the feed more digestible increases the nutritional value of these non-conventional feed sources for the animal. Over the past 20 years, enzyme supplementation in the animal feed sector has grown and developed dramatically. The global feed enzyme market is currently estimated to be more than US$1 billion and is expected to grow by another 8% over the next five years. Right now, phytase holds the largest market share; however, the use of proteases and NSP enzymes, such as xylanase, has accelerated to such an extent that they are being included in over 57% of monogastric diets. Enzymes in poultry feed has been the largest segment, followed by the swine and aquaculture industries. Feed enzymes over the years Early research studying the role of enzymes in poultry nutrition was already taking place in the 1920s. The R&D evolution continued through the 50s and 60s, when barley diets were commonly fed, and research showed that enzymes improved poultry performance. During the 80s and 90s, a better understanding of NSPs in fiber and their impact on animal performance became a focus of the research, and the use of xylanase also became prevalent. During the late 90s, the use of phytase became standard practice. Currently, in terms of the feed penetration of phytase and carbohydrase enzymes such as xylanase, the feed enzyme sector is a mature market. The benefits of providing exogenous enzymes in the feed include the reduction of anti-nutritional factors in the animal feed, the use of lower-cost feed ingredients and an improvement in feed conversion and animal performance — but in order to get the most out of your animal nutrition, it is important that you choose the right feed enzyme to meet your needs. A unique process development The majority of feed enzyme production originates by using both bacterial and fungal microorganisms produced either from the submerged fermentation (SmF) or solid-state fermentation (SSF) processes. Naturally occurring microbial strains for the production of enzymes are of great value and continue to be utilized, but the use of recombinant versions accounts for the majority of industrial enzyme production today. Solid-state fermentation systems can be tailored to address specific needs based on the substrate and microbial selection. For example, Aspergillus niger produces a cocktail of enzymes that contain multi-enzymes such as phytase, xylanase, cellulase, protease and β-glucanase. These enzymes, both as individual applications or as a concoction of enzymes, have a broad spectrum of industrial applications. Early assessments characterized SSF as being a simplistic process, less technologically advanced than the SmF process, but that assessment was later shown to be erroneous and based on a poor understanding of SSF process requirements. Recent rigorous studies have shown that, with the proper design, the technical and economic advantages of SSF far outweigh those of SmF. The many economic advantages of SSF over SmF include a lower capital investment, lower energy requirements, a lower environmental impact based on water consumption and waste generation, and lower costs for downstream processing. Additional studies are needed to continue identifying opportunities for agro-industrial residues as substrates and to match the appropriate microbes to cultivation conditions. Tray fermentation has become the proven leader in large-scale SSF applications, and much work has been completed on the control of key parameters to optimize growth at a commercial scale. Innovations in engineering to allow for large-scale SSF processes offer a major opportunity for growth in the commercial enzyme industry. Maximizing feed efficiency with enzyme technologies Enzymes are well-known to be an effective solution for optimizing feed efficiency. Enzyme supplementation in animal diets increases nutrient digestion by breaking down anti-nutritive components, such as phytate and NSPs, into forms that are more readily absorbed by the animal, reducing the environmental impact as well, while saving on costs for producers. Feed efficiency starts with an accurate knowledge of raw materials and their quality, allowing for the precise adjustment of the feed formulation. How well an enzyme performs, in many cases, is determined before it even reaches the animal. Feed processing methods — whether milling, grinding or, particularly, pelleting — can have a major impact on enzyme stability. Furthermore, digestive tract conditions, particularly pH changes and substrate availability, can also influence enzyme efficiency. Enzyme characteristics can vary widely depending on the source. Solid-state fermentation has the potential to offer competitive advantages based on cost and efficacy.

A retired NASA astronaut and colonel of the United States Air Force, Cady has spent more than 170 days in outer space during the course of three missions, including two on the Space Shuttle and a third as part of Expedition 27 on the International Space Station (ISS), where she lived for more than five months. As the first featured keynote speaker at the Alltech ONE Virtual Experience, Cady gave a presentation on “Innovation in Isolation: An Astronaut’s Guide to Mental Strength, Creativity and Connectivity.” In both her lecture and her subsequent discussion with Dr. Mark Lyons, president and CEO of Alltech, Cady shared pictures and videos of her time in space — as well as some of the lessons she has learned, both on Earth and beyond. Gaining new perspectives on people 220 miles from Earth Cady didn’t always dream of being an astronaut. Despite the fact that her father was a deep-sea diver, she didn’t start thinking of herself as a potential explorer until she attended a campus lecture given by astronaut Sally Ride, the first American woman in space. “You see somebody that you can relate to, and I just thought, ‘Wow, maybe I could try to do that,’” said Cady. After graduating from MIT, Cady was commissioned as a graduate of the Air Force ROTC and entered active duty on Wright-Patterson Air Force Base as a research chemist. During this time, she participated in the NASA Long Duration Exposure Facility experiment, where she set records in endurance and tolerance that still stand today. Unfortunately, not everyone recognized Cady’s potential as quickly as she herself did, but she was able to continue striving toward her goals thanks to her conviction that she deserved a seat at the table. “I knew that I brought things to that team that others didn't,” said Cady. “And I cheerfully showed up to meetings that I wasn't invited to — not because people said, ‘Oh, we didn't like her’ or anything else; it was just that they looked at me and couldn't imagine that I should be part of that team. But I knew. And when it's something as important as exploring space, it gives you that extra courage to just say, ‘I know. I am showing up.’” Cady’s persistence paid off: She was selected to be part of the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1992, and in 1995, she joined the crew of a scientific Space Shuttle mission that logged more than 15 days in space, orbiting the Earth 256 times and traveling more than 6 million miles. She experienced her second space flight in 1999 as a mission specialist in charge of deploying the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, which conducts comprehensive studies of the universe and phenomena such as black holes. And in 2010, she became part of the mission that allowed her to spend 159 days on the ISS. Throughout these missions, Cady began recognizing the beauty of diversity and differences in others. Among the most profound aspects from her time on the ISS was gaining a new perspective on the distance — or lack thereof — between people by seeing the Earth from above. “You just realize that everything is closer than you thought — and so is everyone,” she said. “We’d go around the Earth 16 times a day, and the Earth is turning, so we're always seeing a different slice of it. It becomes so clear that everything is connected — and, actually, everyone could be connected if they just knew that we're all there is.” Teamwork makes the dream work, even in space Recognizing the importance of other perspectives was pivotal to forming bonds and building a successful team on the ISS, where Cady lived and worked among astronauts from Italy, Russia and the United States. “Most of the lessons I learned were about people, about being a crew,” she said. “I had to learn to ask different questions, and I had to learn to listen. You only know this little slice of (your colleagues’) life; you don't know the rest of it. And one of the ways to really make a group (work) is to find out more about the rest of them — really, the rest of their life.” In space and on Earth, Cady noted, the differences among members of a team only make that team stronger, especially when we learn to appreciate other people’s unique offerings. “Every one of us is different,” she said. “Find some way to recognize what people bring (to the table). Make them tell stories about themselves in a group. Get to know each other a little bit. Just knowing a little bit more about somebody, I think, can help you realize that they bring other things.” The ability to collaborate with different people has made Cady a successful leader. She posits that exhibiting true concern for and attention to others is one of the most basic and important tenets of leadership and teambuilding. “Somebody asked me the other day how I basically got people to trust me as a leader, and it made me realize: It's (that) I ask people about themselves,” said Cady. “I do that because I want them to know that I see them and I know that they are more of a person than just the part that comes to work.” Your mission, should you choose to accept it… Once trust and appreciation have been built among team members, the next most important step, said Cady, is focusing on the mission at hand. This concept of taking on a mission and striving to meet a goal is one that Cady has found herself thinking a lot about in the midst of the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns. If anyone knows about social distancing and experiencing long stretches of isolation, it’s astronauts like Cady, who asserts that identifying and focusing on a mission is key to getting through difficult times. “We have this advantage as space explorers that we're part of the mission,” she noted. “It's really clear to you that you've got a job to do, so it's easy to think, ‘It's important for me to be ready, and all these actions, they're important.’ But I think, with COVID-19, the mission can be less tangible. The fact that you stay in your house with your family and stay safe doesn't feel like this step forward. And yet it is. It's a step toward the mission. And I think what can help people is just (to) give it a name. This is the mission: staying safe.” In Cady’s mind, there are some aspects of the COVID-19 lockdown that are actually harder to deal with than being in space — especially the unknowns. “The hardest thing that we don't actually have to wrestle with much in space is that we know, eventually, we're coming home,” she pointed out. “I was up there for six months, and the mission was extended by two weeks, which I was incredibly thrilled about, but it's still finite, whereas, with COVID-19, there's a lot of uncertainties — about finances, about dreams, about what you're going to be able to do next. And owning that uncertainty, I think, is really helpful — realizing that it's hard and just acknowledge you're working through hard things.” Cady’s unique perspective on life has helped her see a silver lining in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic: That, despite being physically distant from each other, people are coming together to help their neighbors and make important changes. “I see a lot of positive happening,” she said. “I see this on the internet, I see it in the news — different people coming together, seeing something that they can do together and doing it. It's so hopeful.” Of all the things Cady learned as an astronaut, her new perspective on humanity and the planet we live on may have been the most meaningful. “I used to think that space was someplace different — like, ‘I'm on Earth, I'm going to go to space’ — but actually arriving up there, it just made me realize that Earth and the place that we live is just bigger than we thought,” she said. “And yet, it's home. And I think, for all of us, getting to look at what is home — home to our ancestors, home to our families — is what is the most special thing to look at as we go around the Earth.” The magic of space exploration has clearly not lost its sparkle for Cady, whose wonder for the world and what lies beyond is uncapped — but whose unique experience away from Earth has only helped her appreciate her fellow man all the more. “It's like leading the life of Peter Pan, and everything is different, and everything is a discovery,” she said. “But we're still human. We each have our own way of bringing that experience back home.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/view-above-stellar-insights-teamwork-diversity-and-achieving-your-dreams","title":"\n\n                    The view from above: Stellar insights into teamwork, diversity and achieving your dreams\n                    ","date":"May 19, 2020","contentLength":1548}},{"pageContent":"This is a guest post from Ryan Goodman. He blogs at Agriculture Proud. Big ideas. We know the future of food systems, demand and supply continues to grow and evolve, but what are the tools that will get us there? Who are the people who will lead us there? What are the disruptive ideas that will fuel those ideas? Sometimes it takes a REBEL to be a LEADER. During Alltech’s 2015 international symposium – REBELation, the theme was exploring how to be a leader, bring disruptive ideas to the table and taking advantage or opportunities to move us forward through innovation. Sometimes this innovative leadership is disruptive, but it often brings about fantastic results that make change. REBELation brought forward a variety of leaders and innovators who all had unique experiences to share. Some of whom I don’t 100% agree with their business practices, which I’ll share more about later, yet they definitely provide great examples for taking advantage of opportunities for disruptive innovation that makes change. If you’ve ever met Alltech’s Founder, Dr. Pearse Lyons, or even heard him speak, you’ll identify him as a man with passion for what he does. He is an innovative businessman, forward thinker, challenger and a rebel. You never know what to expect he’ll say, sometimes you’ll wonder where he’s going with a point, yet his words often challenge you to think. I’ve attended several of Alltech’s meetings in the past, with trips to Lexington and France, and there’s always something new to take home. During this year’s REBELation Opening Session, Dr. Lyons left us with a few words of advice that set the tone for our meetings ahead. Don’t oversleep on your dreams. To be leaders, we must combine urgency and innovation to stay ahead of the curve. Rebels innovate and are constantly seeking new products and ideas. In order to innovative and creative, you have to fall in love with doing things differently. What’s your goal? How do you achieve it? Avoid energy vampires. Make sure your dream has purpose and passion. Don’t die with your music still in you, Do what makes your heart sing. Dr. Lyons goes on to describe qualities of a rebel to include provocateur, firebrand, instigator, motivator, revolutionary. A leader of this type must remain calm and be kind, have a vision but at the same time, be demanding. Qualities which most definitely describe the actions of General Colin Powell, who spoke to the crowd. I’ve never been one to follow many politics or our country’s war efforts closely, but most would definitely recognize General Powell from his time serving our country and working closely with international leaders. He is a man who has been recognized for his leadership and ability to lead his teams on several occasions, which definitely translated to some great advice as he shared his experiences with us. A leader must… Be confident and have a sense of purpose. This translates to your team’s trust in your abilities. Understand what is expected of the leader. Leaders have to understand and convey this to those following. Inspire people. People who are inspired are self-motivated. Have optimism and confidence. Be relevant in today’s world, which often means keeping pace. Recognize performance when a job is done well. Know how to identify problems and fix them. Build bonds of trust in their organization. Look at opportunities in the future and know how to deal with risks when they arrive. Be selfless, not selfish. Execute the plan. How does this apply to agriculture?

By law, commercial feeds must have certain information listed on the tag or bag. A typical feed tag will list product name, a guaranteed analysis, ingredient list, the name and address of the manufacturer or distributor, feeding directions and net weight. The ways in which information is listed can vary either because of individual state laws or manufacturer preference. For instance, ingredients may be listed individually or by using collective terms. While some manufacturers list ingredients by order of inclusion rate, from greatest to least, this is not a requirement. Additionally, individual state laws govern whether certain nutrients can be included in the guaranteed analysis. A general understanding of the information contained on feed tags can help when choosing a feed. What exactly is a guaranteed analysis? Two feeds may have the same or similar guaranteed analyses, but the actual feeds may be very different. The guaranteed analysis simply tells the guaranteed concentration of nutrients (protein, fat, fiber, minerals, etc.) in the feed. When a sample of the feed is tested, the level of nutrients must not be less than the minimum guarantee or more than the maximum guarantee. The guaranteed analysis does NOT, however, reveal anything specific about those ingredients, either their quantity or quality. Thus, two feeds may have the same guaranteed analysis but contain different ingredients. Buzzword nutrients Even when a nutrient is included in the guaranteed analysis, that nutrient may not necessarily be nutritionally significant or beneficial to the horse. A common example is biotin, a B-vitamin known to help improve hoof quality. Research has shown that 20 milligrams of biotin are needed per day to benefit the hoof of an average-sized riding horse (i.e., ~1200 pounds). Some feeds list biotin in the guaranteed analysis at a concentration of or around 0.40 milligrams per pound. At this concentration, the horse would have to consume 50 pounds of this feed per day, every day, to obtain the requisite 20 milligrams of biotin. This feeding rate is unrealistic — but some feeds may contain the same or similar concentrations of biotin and not list it in the guaranteed analysis. Thus, consumer beware: make sure listed nutrients are sufficiently concentrated enough to actually benefit the horse. Ingredients: Are you getting what you pay for? Ingredients may be listed individually by specific name (e.g., oats, corn, barley) or by collective terms for the grouping of the ingredient (e.g., grain products). Collective terms may be used when trying to keep a formula or portion of the formula confidential due to the uniqueness of the product or ingredients. Other reasons for using collective terms include shortening the ingredient list or when least cost formulating. Least cost formulating — which occurs with both collective and individual ingredient lists — happens when the ingredients in the feed change with fluctuating ingredient costs. Oftentimes, having less interest in the quality of the ingredients goes hand-in-hand with the philosophy of least cost formulating. Ingredient quality Regulations do not permit information regarding the grade — that is, the quality — of the ingredients to be placed on the tag, which is important to consider when selecting feeds. For instance, two feeds may have the same ingredient list, but one may use a much higher grade of grain. A higher-quality grain means less contamination and, often, increased nutrient availability. Besides individual grain quality, some grains are simply better for horses than others. For instance, oats are typically the grain of choice for horse feeds because they are relatively high in fiber and are not as prone to harmful molds and mycotoxins as other grains, such as corn. The fiber content of oats is helpful in reducing the risk of digestive upset and founder. Additionally, oat starch is more efficiently utilized by the horse when compared to other grains typically fed to horses. Summary Interpreting feed tags can be quite difficult; what is listed on the tag reveals very little about what is inside the bag, ingredient- or quality-wise. Asking questions and researching grain quality and ingredients are the best tools for finding and feeding a superior-quality feed. When selecting feeds for horses, some important questions to ask include: Does the horse need the nutrients listed? Are the nutrients concentrated at a level beneficial to the horse? Is the formula fixed, or does it fluctuate with ingredient prices? Are the grains utilized the best available for horses? What quality of grain is being used? What is my cost per head per day for feeding? Could I reduce the cost per day and also have a healthier horse by feeding a higher-quality feed?

My father Brian Krull of Lake Mills, Wis. was the most dedicated and driven father, farmer, friend, brother, husband I have ever seen in my 20 years of life! Growing up with him by my side and instilling my sisters and myself with the drive and passion for agriculture has truly changed my life. Brian breed numerous excellent cow families, growing record-breaking crop yields, and raising an even more outstanding family is why this farmer is easily my favorite. Brian had a passion for agronomy and working with the land. He truly enjoyed being out in the field and caring for the land that God had given him to take care. Brian was a member of the Lake Mills FFA and 4-H growing up and had lived in Lake Mills all his life caring for his family’s farm with his family and continuing on with tradition to raise his family on the farm. Brian was not only dedicated to his farm and family but also his community and church. A member of the Lake Mills Moravian Church as well as the Lake Mills FFA Alumni, Bowling team, Aztalan Cemetery President, and served as President and Board Member to the Wisconsin Holstein Association. Brian never cared for himself first, family was always first in his life. People still talk about how when they would see Brian he would never talk about the great crops, cows, or new position or award Brian had received it was always the kids and his wife Cindy he talked about. A farmer who truly has his priorities in the right places was Brian Krull. I have never and will never meet another farmer who can change so many people in such a short time of life. Brian still remains to be my favorite farmer although he is no longer caring for the land that God gave him. Brian was taken doing what he loved where he loved to do it. He died during a farm accident on the family farm on August 26, 2010. Myself (his son) and my mother and sisters continue on his footsteps to ensure we don’t lose the passion and values he gave to us. With Brian now looking down to us and guiding us to the right path, he remains my favorite farmer and the favorite farmer of all who have known him.

But is the farm ready for big data? 84 percent of U.S. farmers who responded to a recent Stratus Ag Research survey said they have high-tech equipment that captures reams of data from livestock, planting, harvesting or crop protection operations. Yet, only 42 percent of them are transferring this information to a field data management software program for further analysis. The question is: How can producers harness all of this information to drive efficiency and profitability once it has been collected? KEENAN, a technological entrepreneur of diet feeders, stepped up to this challenge by expanding into farm data analysis with InTouch technology, which delivers solutions on-farm in real time. “We've been involved with the internet of things (IoT) since about 2011,” said Conan Condon, director of KEENAN’s InTouch system. “At that stage, there wasn't much connectivity. There were about 12 million connected devices. Today, there are about 6.4 billion connected devices.” At present, more than 2,000 livestock operations, ranging in size from tens to thousands of cows, use the InTouch system, a live review and support service that helps producers apply actionable intelligence to their operations, giving them the benefit of KEENAN’s access to data on more than 1.3 million monitored cows. InTouch technology: Acting on data today KEENAN InTouch is a simple, cloud-based communications platform that offers real-time performance monitoring. The system allows for all feed ingredients to be added to the diet feeder in consistent orders and ratios, thereby promoting feeding consistency and improving livestock performance and profitability. ​ Producers are looking for easy alternatives to interpreting and actioning data. InTouch supports that process, as data is automatically transferred and received after completion of every load. Not only are paperwork and time delays eliminated, but the InTouch platform also allows for instant feedback. This means that producers can make informed decisions on maintaining and/or improving ration accuracy, consistency and presentation, thereby maximizing livestock performance. InTouch can also incorporate data from other herd management software programs and services such as the Dairy Herd Improvement Association, resulting in better quality analysis. Convenience is also a key feature of InTouch. Ration changes can be made from a computer or smartphone, through the InTouch customer service center or programmed directly to the KEENAN diet feeder. Nutritionists can also send ration changes directly to the weigh scale on the diet feeder. The pre-self-loading order and mixing time takes the guesswork out of loading accuracy, suggesting a mixing order based on type, length of cut and moisture levels of the ingredients. It also calculates the required number of mixing revolutions needed to maximize effective fiber and delivers a consistent, uniform mix, based on 17 years of data gathered from farms all around the world. To maximize profits for producers, InTouch’s support services help them monitor everything from feed costs and diet feeder performance to proper inclusion rate accuracy in order to maximize profits. Daily, monthly and annual performance reports for feed efficiency, the cost to produce 100 pounds of milk, profit margin per cow and production trends are automatically produced. This means no more combing through data or handwritten notes to find patterns that might unlock efficiency — using InTouch, farm consultants can generate benchmark summary reports that can reveal management practices to improve livestock performance and profitability. The MechFiber difference Based on years of data from more than 1 million cows, KEENAN has developed a range of products tailored to the needs of farmers, including reel, self-propelled, vertical and static machines for small- to medium-sized farms and pro-mixers for high-volume feed manufacturing and larger farms. These machines are designed to improve rumen health, resulting in improved feed efficiency and livestock production. They are durable and easy to maintain, with a low daily operating cost and stationary blades for controlled chopping. They have a simple drive system, with no gearbox required and they empty completely, so no ration ingredients intended for one group of animals are fed to another. Each diet feeder has two chambers (mixing and dispensing) and, together with a six-paddle reel and patented fixed-knives system, is engineered to produce a consistent, uniform, fluffy mix called MechFiber, which is unique to KEENAN machines. Independent trials have consistently shown that MechFiber retains the fiber structure needed to stimulate rumination, allowing greater absorption of energy and maximizing feed conversion efficiency. ​ KEENAN diet feeders produce consistent rations from as little as five percent capacity up to 22,000 pounds. They easily handle and deliver a consistent, uniform mix for smaller dry cows, post-fresh cows and heifer groups. KEENAN customers can purchase separate ingredients to prepare their own premixes. Additionally, the low-power requirement design saves up to 50 percent in fuel consumption and reduces tractor and KEENAN diet feeder maintenance costs. Larger, more expensive tractors are not required compared to equivalent capacity vertical mixers, as a 120-horsepower tractor will operate a 1,000-cubic-foot diet feeder at recommended speeds of 1,200–1,500 revolutions per minute. KEENAN started manufacturing quality diet feeders with cutting-edge designs and technology in 1978. In 2016, Alltech acquired KEENAN and is re-establishing the diet feeder in the U.S. market with a fresh approach to innovation that builds on KEENAN’s strong reputation for quality and performance. Manufactured in Borris, County Carlow in Ireland, KEENAN products are available for purchase in the U.S. For more information about KEENAN, visit www.keenansystem.com.

Colostrum, the first milk produced by the cow at calving, offers a rich source of energy, nutrients, immune cells and antibodies. These antibodies are especially important since newborn calves lack disease protection, as antibodies do not pass through the cow’s placenta to the calf’s circulatory system. The antibodies in the cow’s colostrum will provide her calf with initial disease protection. The immunity acquired during the first few days of life is particularly important for calf health and survival. Studies on calf death loss have shown that 4–12% of calves are either stillborn or die within the first 24 hours after birth. While there are many risk factors during this time that may lead to calf mortality, early nutrition and colostrum management are key influences. What are immunoglobulins? For the first three to five weeks of a calf’s life, the passive immunity received from the absorption of immunoglobulins in colostrum provides substantial protection to help the calf fight off infections, illness and diseases. Immunoglobulins are large protein molecules that function as antibodies and that are produced by plasma or white blood cells. They serve an important purpose in immune response by fighting off bacteria, viruses and other harmful invaders. There are different classes of immunoglobulins that each have specific functions, biological features, targets and structures. The primary (80–85%) colostral antibodies are immunoglobulin G (IgG), followed by immunoglobulin A (IgA, at 8–10%) and immunoglobulin M (IgM, at 5–12%). The major factors that will influence newborn calf colostral immunoglobulin absorption are: 1. The age of the calf when it receives its first feeding of colostrum. 2. The number of immunoglobulins made available to the calf. Colostrum absorption is maximized and at its most efficient shortly after birth, beginning to decline steadily as time passes, with very minimal absorption occurring 20 hours post-calving. However, in some calves, this closure of the gut can occur as early as 12 hours postpartum. Despite the length of time to gut closure, immunoglobulin transfer across the gut epithelium is most efficient in the first four hours postpartum and begins to decline rapidly after 12 hours postpartum. By 24 hours, it is estimated that only 10% of immunoglobulins are absorbed. Therefore, it is important to get that essential colostrum into the calf as soon as possible. While these large proteins can be transferred through the gut prior to closure, so too can bacteria and large particles that may be harmful if ingested. This is yet another reason why it is so important to calve on clean, dry ground. The number of immunoglobulins presented to the newborn calf is dependent on the volume of colostrum available and the immunoglobulin concentration of that colostrum. The quality of the colostrum can be affected by the dam’s age, health and nutrition status. Cows that are older — i.e., in at least their third lactation — typically have a higher volume of colostrum that is better-quality compared to the colostrum of a younger cow or first-calf heifer. While there are tools that can be used to measure colostrum quality, typically, good indicators of high-quality colostrum include a tan or yellow color and very thick, creamy consistency. Nutritional status of the dam The dam’s nutritional status can greatly impact the colostrum available to the calf. Colostrum and immunoglobulins start to form 5–6 weeks prior to calving. A Virginia Tech study has shown that colostrum volume and calf absorption of IgG were lower in nutrient-restricted cows compared to cows fed to their requirements, even though the IgG concentrations did not change. A study in sheep found that nutrient restriction from mid- to late pregnancy in ewe lambs altered colostrum quality and quantity. The dam’s nutrition prior to calving can greatly impact the amount of colostrum produced and the absorption of immunoglobulins, which may lead to scours and higher mortality rates if inadequate. Bio-Mos® 2 has been shown to support gut integrity and colostrum quality, thereby promoting overall performance. This product should be fed two months prior to calving for optimal results. Failure of passive transfer A frequent problem during calving season is failure of passive transfer (FPT), which occurs when a newborn calf does not receive the necessary colostrum. This can occur if cows were in a nutrient deficit and did not produce quality colostrum, or, in cases of dystocia, weak calves, temperature stress or the dam not taking care of her new calf, all of which can prevent the newborn calf from nursing. These factors may prevent the calf from not only getting essential nutrients from colostrum but also from getting the required antibodies. FPT can result in significant economic losses through increased calf illness and death. If a calf has not nursed or is at a high risk for not nursing within the first couple of hours, it may be best to intervene and provide it with colostrum. The ideal method for a calf to receive colostrum is from its own dam. If possible, use a chute to restrain the cow in order to allow the calf to nurse. If the calf does not want to suckle, the cow could be milked out and a tube feeder can be used to get colostrum into the calf. A newborn calf should be fed about two quarts of colostrum within four to six hours post-birth and again within four to six hours from the original feeding. Colostrum should be collected within 24 hours of calving. If collecting from the cow is not possible, colostrum replacers or supplements can be used. In these situations, consult a veterinarian for assistance in selecting the best option. Remember, the first meal is the most important meal of a calf’s life and plays an instrumental role in calf immune system development. It is vital to ensure that each calf receives rich, nutritious colostrum in order to set them on a path to successful performance.

Up to that point I had worked in the family business but I broke away from tradition to join an agricultural course in DKIT who had partnered with Ballyhaise Agricultural College. I soon fell in love with Agriculture and quickly set my goals with what I wanted to achieve during my time at college. Graduating from UCD was a very proud day for both myself and my family, it was sad saying goodbye to all the friends I had made but it was made easier knowing I was selected to join the Alltech family on the Dairy Career Development Programme. I gathered on-farm skills from managing a 200 cow beef herd in the Loire valley in France and travelled to South Dakota in the summer of 2013 to broaden my knowledge of the dairy industry on a bigger scale. This experience was priceless and will stand to me for the challenges that lie ahead. From the moment I applied for the programme with Alltech I had no doubt what I wanted to do and as the saying goes, \"what’s for you won’t pass you.\" Getting to join Alltech is a dream come true and I know for sure tough and busy times lie ahead. My first week consisted of meeting all the Alltech family of workers in Dunboyne, the Irish headquarters. From the outset people were introducing themselves and everyone was extremely supportive. I know for sure that even if I’m in the countryside of Vietnam there will be someone with a listening ear just a phone call away. We had various different speakers in this week and I can see already that the level of training we are receiving is second to none. There is a lot of information to take on board in a short space of time but nobody said the real world was going to be easy.

Lameness in all sectors of the beef industry can lead to decreased performance. It is estimated that approximately 20% of lameness in all cattle — dairy and beef — is attributed to foot rot (Step, et al., 2016). However, in the beef industry alone, it is estimated that closer to 75% of all diagnosed lameness in cattle is attributed to foot rot (Currin et al., 2009). Cattle in the feedlot have been reported to have close to half a pound lower average daily gains while they are combating foot rot (Brazzle, 1993). Therefore, foot rot represents a significant economic loss to the industry due to decreased performance. What causes foot rot? Bacteria are responsible for the cause of foot rot. The main foot rot-causing bacteria in cattle is Fusobacterium necrophorum, a ubiquitous bacterium found in the environment. Researchers have isolated it on the surface of healthy feet, in the rumen and in the feces of beef cattle. Other bacteria that are present on healthy feet can increase the virulence of F. necrophorum and, therefore, increase the incidence of foot rot (Currin et al., 2009). It is not until there is an injury to the foot — caused by walking on rough surfaces or standing in wet, damp and/or muddy conditions, resulting in a weakening of the foot tissues — that the bacteria sets in and wreaks havoc on the foot. Another common cause of foot rot is when cattle quickly go from wet conditions to dry conditions. This can cause the skin to become chapped and cracked, giving F. necrophorum a chance to enter the tissues of the hoof. Mineral deficiencies in zinc, selenium and copper are also known causes of foot rot (NRC, 2017). Because foot rot can be caused by a ubiquitous bacterium, it is not considered contagious. Symptoms of foot rot Clinical foot rot will present with the following symptoms: Extreme pain, leading to the sudden onset of lameness Elevated body temperature Bilateral swelling of the interdigital tissues, around the hairline and coronary band of the hoof. The swelling may lead to greater-than-normal separation of the claws Necrotic lesions in the interdigital space, with a foul odor Decreased feed intake These symptoms can be similar to the symptoms of other foot issues that are common in beef cattle. For example, digital dermatitis, commonly referred to as hairy heel wart, is often mistaken for foot rot when cattle become lame (Step et al., 2016). However, digital dermatitis only affects the skin in the heel bulb area and up to the area of the dew-claw. Digital dermatitis also does not produce a foul odor, is more centralized and is contagious. How to treat foot rot Once the proper diagnosis is made, foot rot can be treated. Treatment for foot rot is most successful when completed early, toward the beginning of its onset. The most common method of treatment is via tetracycline antibiotics (Currin et al., 2016). It is crucial to consult a local veterinarian for recommendations about antibiotics and the proper dosage levels. Other common treatments include rubbing a sterilized rope or twine between the animal’s toes to remove the necrotic tissue, followed by applying a topical antimicrobial and simply keeping the foot clean and dry while antibiotic treatment is given. There are practices that can help reduce the risk of foot rot in a herd. For example, if caused by wet and muddy conditions, ensure proper drainage and the sloping of pastures or barns, such that moisture doesn’t collect in locations where cattle often congregate. Additionally, smoothing rough areas and ensuring that pastures and pens are kept clear of sharp debris that can cause abrasions or scratches to the hooves can help keep foot rot at bay. Simply ensuring that cattle are fed proper levels of minerals has shown to reduce the incidence of foot rot. Zinc is known to be critical for maintaining the integrity of the skin and hoof (NRC, 2016); thus, zinc should be fed at proper levels — and even elevated levels, if foot rot is known to be a common issue (Kellems and Church, 2010). Organic complexes of zinc are commonly included in beef diets at normal levels. However, with the increased bioavailibity of zinc in its organic form, it is wise to ensure the proper zinc status of the herd to reduce the incidence of foot rot. Although iodine is not known to be a mineral involved directly in foot integrity, dietary EDDI, a common source of iodine used in mineral supplements and premixes, has shown to be beneficial in the prevention of foot rot. Foot rot is a significant cause of lameness in beef cattle and can result in a major economic and production loss in some herds. Although foot rot-causing bacteria can be found everywhere and are sometimes unavoidable, quick treatment early on and practicing proper pasture and pen maintenance can help to reduce the chances of clinical foot rot in beef cattle. Also, making sure the zinc and iodine levels are properly maintained during all stages of production in forms such as EDDI and organic complexes such as Alltech’s Bioplex Zinc can maximize protection against foot rot.

After all, puppies are often incomparably adorable — and, as a lifelong dog owner, I can attest to the fact that life with a dog really is better. Still, I think it’s important to remember that this change in lifestyle can be complicated. Raising a puppy is typically not for the faint of heart. Much like small children, young dogs are incredibly demanding of your time and attention, and they are often prone to bouts of sheer willfulness. Your patience will be tested, and you may find yourself occasionally feeling unsure about the added responsibility — but if you put in the time and effort, you will almost certainly be rewarded with an enjoyable companion for many years to come. Below are six tips to help you and your new puppy get started on the path to a long and happy life together: 1. Practice good nutrition: Puppies mature rapidly and have twice the daily nutritional requirements of adult dogs. Their muscles, joints, bones, internal organs and immune system are just a few of the major components still developing in their first one to two years of life. A complete and balanced puppy food designed for your dog’s mature size (i.e., small, medium or large) will contain specific nutrients tailored to meet their critical needs. I specifically elaborate on puppy nutrition in this previous article but feel it is also worth noting that you should resist the urge to feed your dog table scraps or “people food” of any kind. Begging is an incredibly difficult habit to break, and human food is typically unhealthy for dogs, as it can lead to digestive issues and increase the potential for obesity. 2. Provide proper veterinary care: Your pup will need more regular visits to the vet in his or her first year of life in order to complete the necessary vaccinations and check-ups to make sure he or she is progressing normally. Spaying or neutering should also be completed within the first year, unless you intend to use your dog for breeding purposes. Along with preventing unwanted litters, getting your dog “fixed” provides many health and behavioral benefits, including a decreased risk for certain infections and cancers and a reduced breeding instinct, which can make them less inclined to roam. If you’re feeling unsure about spaying or neutering, this article from the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA) is very informative. 3. Establish a routine: Much like humans, dogs are creatures of habit who tend to thrive on a routine, which helps them feel more secure and comfortable in their environment. Feeding, walking, training and playtime should all be incorporated, and housetraining will go much more smoothly if your puppy knows when to expect potty breaks. Dogs who feel well-established in their day-to-day lives will find it much easier to weather the changes that will inevitably come along from time to time. 4. Start training straightaway: It really is never too early to start teaching your new dog the basics (e.g., sit, stay, down, come — and, as an aside, I think proper crate training is also very wise), but it is also important to remember not to expect too much from them too fast. As mentioned above, housetraining is aided by routine, but it is important to note that young dogs can typically only hold their bladders for one hour or so per every month of age; don’t expect them to “hold it” for longer and then get upset when they have an accident. In any case, your dog will be unlikely to associate their “mistake” with your frustration. It is also worth noting that positive reinforcement of good behaviors is critical. You should discourage any behaviors that might seem fine now but that will prove problematic down the road when your dog reaches its mature size, such as jumping. It can be rather difficult to curb bad behaviors that are essentially enforced during a dog’s youth. 5. Socialize and supervise: Proper socialization is critical to a dog’s future behaviors, but you should supervise all interactions — and, for that matter, you should supervise your puppy as much as possible, since a young dog left to his or her own devices will most likely end up finding some sort of mischief. Enrolling in a puppy class is a great way to advance your training, develop your bond and get your dog accustomed to being around other puppies and people (note that reputable training academies will require current vaccinations for all canine participants). Take your dog along with you as often as you can so that you can expose him or her to all sorts of novel things but be careful not to overwhelm them; recall that patience is a virtue, one that new pet parents must have in spades. A young dog who learns to be comfortable in a variety of settings and situations will be far less likely to exhibit fearfulness and unwanted behaviors, such as aloofness and aggression, later in life. This is particularly important if you wish to do any advanced training or participate in activities like therapy dog work. 6. Be realistic: This might be the most important advice of all. Puppies are young, and they are going through a lot of big changes. Recall that they have just been separated from their mother and siblings and taken to a new home, a new family and a whole host of new expectations. It can be incredibly easy to become frustrated with them but remember: they may not know any better at this stage — and that’s where you come in! You play a huge role in shaping your dog’s behaviors and ensuring that he or she stays healthy. You must also realize that, while puppies can be difficult to deal with, adolescent dogs can be far worse. Much like teenagers (which they essentially are), they will test boundaries, want to explore their environment more, experience selective hearing and crave more independence. Your patience will almost certainly be tested the most during this stage of life (which will last between 6 months to 2 years of age, depending on your dog’s size), but hold firm, stay positive and be consistent — remember: this too shall pass.

Over the next several weeks we will be posting interviews from the Irish host farmers and farmers from all over the world who went on the tours. In the meantime we have some great photos from the tours on our Dairy Heroes Facebook page and we will be adding more photos over the next couple of days. Here are highlights from some of the farms that we visited. Thanks to Farm Tours Ireland for coordinating them for us. Dairy Farms Pat Callan, Philipstown, Co. Louth This farm milks 160 Montbeliarde cows and the annual herd average is 8,000 litres. The herd is split, calving between autumn and spring. A large emphasis is placed on detailed grazing management and all forage is produced on the farm in the form of grass and maize silages. Michael McDonnell, Termonfeckin, Co. Louth The herd produces an average of 10,000 litres annually and is split between autumn and spring calving. High quality grass silage and maize silage are an essential part of the farm strategy to achieve high performance. Bingham Farm, Co. Antrim The Binghams milk 500 high-yielding Holstein cows. They produce quality grass silage as the main forage source and achieve excellent yields from their forage inputs. Recent investment in housing and milking facilities has resulted in production benefits. Beef Farms Tara Farms Ltd., Dunboyne, Co. Meath Tara Farms is a large-scale feedlot finishing approximately 1,500 animals annually. There is a mixture of bulls and heifers, all produced for the Italian market, a premium market for Irish beef producers. Excellent weight gains and high levels of efficiency are achieved on this farm. Moyvalley Meat Farm, Co. Meath Moyvalley Meat Farm is integrated with Moyvalley Meats and finishes approximately 2,000 steers and heifers throughout the winter period. Quality grass silage is produced on the farm. Brian McCabe, Co. Louth This farm is a small feedlot, finishing 600-700 animals annually, which are mainly heifers for the Italian market. Mr. McCabe produces grass and maize silage and feeds them together with large volumes of homegrown wheat and barley. The unit achieves impressive weight gains and high quality carcasses. Joseph O’Reilly, Co. Louth This farm has 110 crossbred cows which are split between calving in autumn and spring. All animals are finished on farm. Mr. O’Reilly has a preference for using Limousin as the terminal sire.

In the early stages of their lives, these young animals are more susceptible to health issues that would never affect older, more developed pigs. These challenges can come from all angles, as disease-causing organisms (such as bacteria, protozoa and viruses) are present in every part of the farm environment. From the sow to farm personnel, equipment, bedding and feed materials, there is no escape from these threats. Even with the appropriate biosecurity measures in place, as piglets grow, they encounter other health-impacting sources. Changes in the diet, for example, can cause digestive disorders, manifested as diarrhea and failure to thrive and grow. Due to the exposure to and consumption of external, potentially disease-bearing entities, such as water, feed and bedding, maintaining proper immunity is essential. Optimizing gut structures and microbial populations is vital for young animals, as it establishes the basis for their ongoing health and development. Piglets have very specific needs to establish good gut health and functions and to limit disease development. Providing the best gut health in young piglets can be achieved through various feeding interventions. Here are three crucial stages of developing good gut health in piglets to help put you on the right path. 1. Optimize colostrum from the sow While in the womb, pigs benefit from the fully developed immune system of the sow. However, once born, piglets do not take any of these immunities along with them, essentially starting from scratch. To help encourage good gut health, the producer's task is to ensure that the newborn piglets have a good supply of immunoglobulins (Igs). These act as the first line of defense for young piglets, helping them to build their immune system to fight off the challenges they face in their environment. The best source of Igs is the colostrum supplied by the piglet’s mother, making it a crucial first step in optimizing gut health in piglets. After the initial colostrum intake, piglet immunity status tends to diminish, making them more vulnerable to disease, which commonly manifests as: Diarrhea Dehydration Poor milk consumption In addition, the switch from a milk-based diet to a grain-based diet at weaning means that their gut structures and microbial populations need to adapt quickly. This difficult period is referred to as the “weaning gap” in terms of health and immunity and occurs somewhere between 14–21 days of age. To ensure that piglets continue to get the support they need and have a strong base to help them through the diet transition, the expression of Igs in the sow’s colostrum must be optimized. This can be achieved by including prebiotics and mannan-rich fractions (MRF) in sow gestation diets. Feeding trials (Spring et al., 2006) have shown that doing so increases the levels of all Igs in the colostrum and in the blood of the subsequent piglets that receive it. 2. Promote good gut health directly As well as using them to optimize the mother’s colostrum, pre- and probiotics can be administered orally to piglets, promoting the development of the correct bacterial balances within the gut, establishing the best basis for future disease prevention, and maximizing health and growth. Long-established research studying MRF has shown that it binds to the projections on the surface of disease-causing microbes, preventing them from attaching to the gut wall, which they need to do to reproduce, leading to harmless removal in feces. In addition, this binding activity interacts with the immune system in the gut, promoting faster responses to any disease threat. Multiple trials have shown that this activity of promoting better gut health increases feed intake, digestion and growth and improves feed conversion. 3. Use high-quality creep feeds When piglets reach the age to begin weaning, creep feeding is introduced to prepare their digestive systems for the change in diet. This is another opportunity for the producer to bolster the young animal’s gut health by formulating creep feed with the best-quality raw materials, processed to maximize digestion and supplemented with proven feed ingredients. These can include: Nucleotides to facilitate gut tissue development Enzymes for maximum digestion Chelated minerals to ensure the best uptake and establish tissue mineral reserves during times of stress These types of diets will ease the difficult period during weaning and will not compromise the gut environment, keeping disease at bay. Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and are essential for young animal development. They have been shown to significantly increase the growth of gut tissues and are important for repairing and preventing damage to the gut wall. A more robust gut structure is necessary to withstand the change from milk to grain-based feeds at weaning, when the erosion of essential structures (villi) for nutrient absorption can occur. Seed, Feed, Weed Over the last 40 years, Alltech has conducted extensive research studying gut health and has designed several gut health management programs that focus on supporting animal performance from birth by promoting favorable bacteria communities, building natural defenses and maximizing growth. The Seed, Feed, Weed (SFW) concept is one such program that is designed to modify the gut microbial population to establish favorable and more diverse microbial populations after birth. This program utilizes the advice above to help establish and maintain a beneficial and diverse gut microbiome in piglets. The SWF program supports gut health in piglets by: Seeding the gut with favorable organisms: It is vital to “seed” the intestine with the correct bacteria as soon as possible after birth. The first organisms to colonize the gut will determine the composition of the flora by creating the micro-environment necessary to establish a complex microbial community and optimal architectural development. With the right intestinal microflora now in place, piglets show improved early growth, feed conversion, uniformity and livability. Feeding the favorable organisms: In addition to “seeding” the gut with the correct pioneer species, it is crucial to enhance the capacity of favorable organisms to colonize and rapidly dominate the microbial community in the small intestine. Once a beneficial microbial community and intestinal ecology is established, the villi will flourish. This step is critical for piglet health and feed efficiency because the healthier a piglet’s villi, the more efficiently nutrients will be absorbed. Weeding out the unfavorable microorganisms: The gut can also contain harmful pathogenic microbes (e.g., enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli), which can damage the intestinal villi. It is, therefore, important to “weed them out” before they can attach to the gut lining and replicate enough to cause disease. By blocking the attachment mechanisms of unfavorable organisms with a type-1 fimbria blocker, their capacity to compete with the favorable organisms (e.g., Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus) in the gut is reduced. Minimizing the gut’s exposure to these harmful microbes will help to improve the animal’s natural defenses and shorten its recovery time from disease. Figure 1. The Seed, Feed, Weed concept is designed to modify the microbial population in the gut to establish favorable and more diverse microbial communities after birth. Providing solutions for each step of the Seed, Feed, Weed process, Alltech offers a range of products for both the sow and their young that help to optimize piglet nutrition and support gut health and development. These include: Actigen® NuPro® Allsyme SSF® Bioplex® Sel-Plex® Viligen™ As they start life, baby pigs are extremely vulnerable. Any change in their environment potentially exposes them to a whole new group of pathogens, which can limit their performance. Furthermore, as they mature over the weaning period, they are typically moved into new environments and exposed to other equipment, animals and people. Ensuring that the best gut health is established as early as possible is key to limiting disease, increasing health and welfare and maximizing growth. This is essential for the young piglet and helps to ensure optimal lifetime performance and profitability for producers in a sustainable manner. The use of gut health management programs will also play a pivotal role in helping producers work toward antibiotic- and ZnO-free production. I'd like to learn more about pig nutrition.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/3-stages-optimizing-piglet-nutrition-gut-health-0","title":"\n\n                    3 stages of optimizing piglet nutrition for gut health\n                    ","date":"November 3, 2020","contentLength":1357}},{"pageContent":"Agriculture and nutrition aren’t often thought of synonymously. Traditionally, human nutrition has been placed in the territory of health care professionals. However, farmers and producers play an integral role in providing access to diverse, nutritious foods – the foundation of good health. With a growing world population, nutrition-focused agriculture strategies are becoming increasingly important. How can we position agriculture to improve nutrition and health worldwide? Nutrition-focused agriculture strategies, including more sustainable approaches towards food production, dietary diversification and food enrichment can improve diet quality, combat nutrient deficiencies and boost overall nutrition. By applying a nutrition lens to agriculture, researchers, farmers, producers, agronomists and animal nutritionists have the potential to help close the “nutrition gap” – the gap between what foods are available and what foods need to be available for good nutrition worldwide. Nutrient deficiency in plants, soil and livestock is a global issue that largely contributes to the deficiencies found in humans. The opportunity exists to address these deficiencies via nutrition interventions delivered by the agricultural sector. Improved agronomic practices and more nutritious animal and aquaculture feed have the potential to maximize the health and production of both plants and animals, while increasing the nutritional content of food and reducing health risks for consumers. The role of biotechnology in improving health and wellness through the food chain is expanding. Micronutrient-enriched fertilizers improve soil fertility and the plant’s ability to utilize nutrients, helping to support higher yields of more nutritious food. Correcting nutrient deficiencies in crops is a step towards correcting deficiencies of the same nutrients in humans. Probiotic crop applications create a healthier environment for plants to grow. Probiotics assist in the uptake of nutrients by the plant to produce a more abundant nutrient-dense crop. Enriched animal and aquaculture feed return essential nutrients back into the diet of livestock and fish. Enriched feed not only improves the health of the animal, it also naturally increases the nutritive value of the food product for consumers. Improving global access to naturally occurring macro and micronutrients in whole, unprocessed foods will be a key contributor to success in improving human nutrition through agricultural investments. As we look to the future, agriculture must be prioritized in human nutrition. By improving the health of animals, land and plants, we can provide higher quality, more nutritious food to nourish the world.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/prioritizing-agriculture-human-nutrition","title":"\n\n                    Prioritizing Agriculture in Human Nutrition\n                    ","date":"September 2, 2014","contentLength":390}},{"pageContent":"It’s completely natural to assign human traits and emotions to our animals. After all, anthropomorphism is considered an innate tendency of human psychology. But what happens when this desire to humanize our four-legged friends goes too far? Take laminitis, for instance: a common cause of this highly painful, debilitating and potentially life-threatening disease is overfeeding — so could we actually be killing our horses with kindness? Laminitis: What is it? The literal definition of laminitis is inflammation of the laminae — the non-sensitive, outer epidermal tissue, as well as the sensitive, inner dermal tissue between the hoof wall and coffin bone — on a horse’s foot. These tissues mesh together to hold the hoof wall to the coffin bone (also known as the pedal bone). If the blood flow to these tissues is interrupted, inflammation can set in and weaken the laminae structures, thereby interfering with the connection between the hoof wall and coffin bone. This condition can affect just one foot or all four, but it most commonly affects the front feet at the same time and does not discriminate — it can impact any horse or pony. Unless the cause of the inflammation is removed and treatment begins immediately at the first signs of laminitis, the dermal laminae will begin to die. Since they are responsible for significant support in the hoof, which bears the horse’s weight, the coffin bone may begin to sink and rotate due to the inability of the damaged laminae to support both the bone and the pull of the digital flexor tendon. The bone may even sink far enough to protrude from the sole of the foot. This is often irreversible but can occasionally be cured with a great deal of time and patience, along with a significant financial investment. What causes it? Several factors can play a role, but animals who are overweight or have previously suffered from laminitis are especially at risk. Common causes include: An excess intake of carbohydrates, either from overfeeding of grain, grain overload from a horse or pony getting into a feed room, or unrestricted access to lush pasture grasses The stress of a change in environment, frequent travel or foaling in broodmares Septicemic conditions, severe infections or retained placenta in mares post-foaling Obesity, particularly in ponies Lameness, which prevents the bearing of weight in one leg, leading to overloading of another limb Concussion to the hoof from working unshod on hard ground or from an overzealous hoof trim Metabolic disorders, such as Cushing’s disease What are the signs? The symptoms of acute laminitis are typically sudden and severe and include: Inability or reluctance to walk Lying down, combined with an unwillingness to stand Readily apparent lameness, especially when moving in a circle or walking on a hard surface Increased digital pulse Leaning back onto hind feet in an attempt to relieve the pressure on front feet Pain at the point of the frog and walking heel-first instead of toe-first Chronic laminitis, also known as founder, can instead come on gradually and is often the result of either a sustained diet rich in carbohydrates or a metabolic disorder. It can also manifest in horses whose feet are severely compromised as the result of a previous, non-fatal, acute episode. Horses afflicted with chronic laminitis will typically exhibit the following symptoms: Lameness that ranges from mild to moderate A willingness to stand and walk, despite obvious foot pain Irregular bands of growth in the hoof wall Heels that grow faster than toes White line widening A noticeable crest running along the neckline Changed foot shape, often becoming narrow and elongated Treatment If you witness any of the above symptoms in your horse, contact both your veterinarian and farrier immediately. You will need to develop and administer a treatment plan as quickly as possible to prevent any lasting damage and to relieve any associated pain. When not treated quickly or correctly, permanent damage from laminitis can result in euthanasia. Horses who have been overfed must immediately be separated from their feed source; consult with your vet on a revised feeding regimen Move the horse or pony to a small pen or stall and bed deeply with shavings so they can dig their hooves into a comfortable position Avoid exercise, as it may initially contribute to further rotation of the coffin bone Have your farrier consult with your vet and trim the hoof according to the degree of rotation of the coffin bone Provide the horse with a companion to help minimize stress Prevention Monitor your horse’s diet and weight very carefully Feed small amounts frequently to mimic a horse’s natural feeding patterns Restrict grass intake and avoid turning out on lush grasses, particularly in early spring or after heavy rains Maintain a consistent exercise regimen to aid in weight management Regularly schedule visits with a reputable farrier Support hoof strength and growth by offering high-quality nutrition and premium equine supplements, such as Lifeforce Hoof This disease is very painful and incapacitating for horses.

A wise person avoids it.” I want to learn more about equine health and management recommendations.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/no-hoof-no-horse-laminitis-treatment-and-prevention","title":"\n\n                    No hoof, no horse: Laminitis treatment and prevention\n                    ","date":"February 12, 2019","contentLength":878}},{"pageContent":"Today we are proud to announce a major acquisition that we believe will allow us to deliver even better service and greater value to our customers globally.

New research from Oxford University and the University of California, Davis have recently debunked some of the most critical and long-standing myths surrounding animal agriculture. But can this breakthrough overcome animal agriculture’s bad reputation? The current narrative about animal agriculture says that ruminant livestock animals (e.g., beef cattle, dairy cattle, etc.) produce methane. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas. Thus, animal agriculture is bad for the environment. During a keynote presentation for the Alltech ONE Virtual Experience, Dr. Frank Mitloehner, professor at the University of California, Davis and air quality specialist, boldly proclaimed a path for animal agriculture to become climate-neutral. Yes, “you heard me right — climate-neutral,” said Dr. Mitloehner. He said he would like to, “get us to a place where we have the impacts of animal agriculture that are not detrimental to our climate.” Important Greenhouse Gases to Know 3 myths about animal agriculture’s environmental impact debunked Myth #1: Methane (the most common greenhouse gas, or GHG, in animal agriculture) acts just like other GHGs in the environment. Fact: The three main greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, all impact the environment in critically different ways, especially as it relates to their source, life span in the atmosphere and global warming potential. Carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide are known as “stock gases.” Stock gases are long-lived gases and once emitted will continue to build up in the atmosphere. Carbon dioxide, for example, has an estimated lifespan in the atmosphere of 1,000 years, meaning carbon dioxide emitted from the year 1020 may still be in the atmosphere today. Methane, on the other hand, is a “flow gas.” Flow gases are short-lived gases and are removed from the atmosphere at a more rapid pace. Methane’s lifespan in the atmosphere is approximately 10 years. This means a flow gas like methane would impact the environment for a duration that is nearly 100 times shorter than the stock gas carbon dioxide. What causes these gases in the first place? Carbon dioxide is created by the burning of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels are used as the energy source to power most homes, vehicles and industry globally. As the graph below depicts, Dr. Mitloehner refers to stock gases like carbon dioxide as a “one-way street” because they only accumulate in the environment over time due to their long lifespan. Methane can be produced in a variety of methods, but most commonly, it’s produced through the rumination process in beef and dairy livestock (i.e., belching). As a short-lived flow gas, “The only time that you really add new additional methane to the atmosphere with the livestock herd is throughout the first 10 years of its existence or if you increase your herd sizes,” explained Dr. Mitloehner. Methane levels do not increase if herd sizes remain constant because methane is being broken down at the same rate it is being produced. “What I'm saying here by no means (is) that methane doesn't matter,” he continued. “While that methane is in the atmosphere, it is heat-trapping, it is a potent greenhouse gas. But the question really is, do our livestock herds add to additional methane, meaning additional carbon in the atmosphere, leading to additional warming? And the answer to that question is no. As long as we have constant herds or even decreasing herds, we are not adding additional methane, and hence not additional warming. And what I just said to you is a total change in the narrative around livestock.” Alternatively, carbon dioxide is created from extracting fossil fuels that are millions of years old and are trapped under the Earth’s surface. “These long-lived climate pollutants are only emitted,” said Dr. Mitloehner. “They are put into the atmosphere, but there's no real sink for it in a major way.” This demonstrates that carbon dioxide and methane are very different types of gases (stock versus flow) and have very different lifespans in the environment (1,000 years versus 10 years), but what about their global warming potential? Myth #2: The current method for assessing the global warming potential (GWP100) of greenhouse gases properly accounts for all important variables. Fact: The initial method for calculating GWP100 misrepresents the impact of short-lived flow gases, like methane, on future warming. The new “GWP*” is an improved and more representative measurement. The initial GWP100 measures produced by the Kyoto Protocol nearly 30 years ago marked a very positive step for assessing global warming. The initial documents included many footnotes and caveats to account for variability and unknown values. “But the footnotes were cut off, and people ran with (it),” said Dr. Mitloehner. “And in my opinion, that was a very dangerous situation that has really gotten animal agriculture into a lot of trouble, actually, quite frankly.” The current GWP100 measurement generates an over-assessment of methane’s contributions to global warming. Currently, in short, GWP100 measurements are all standardized to a billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. So, all non-carbon dioxide emissions are converted by multiplying the amount of the emissions of each gas by its global warming potential over 100 years value. Methane has a GWP100 value of 28, meaning it is 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Unfortunately, this type of calculation completely omits the fact that flow gases, like methane, are destroyed after approximately 10 years and would not continue for the entire 100-year duration as described in the GWP100 formula. Additionally, it underestimates the impact that stock gases, like carbon dioxide, would have that persist in the environment for 1,000 years. Dr. Mitloehner cited Dr. Myles Allen from Oxford University as the pioneer of a new calculation called “GWP*.” The new GWP* calculation better accounts for both gas intensity and gas lifespan in the atmosphere in its measurements of global warming. This is a new narrative to explain global warming emissions and, Dr. Mitloehner said, “you will see it will gain momentum, and it will become the new reality” soon. Myth #3: To keep up with increasing demand and global population growth, the United States has continued to increase its numbers of beef and dairy cattle, thus increase methane emissions. Fact: The United States reached peak beef and dairy cattle numbers in the 1970s and has reduced its number of animals every decade since, resulting in 50 million fewer cattle in total. Over the last half-century, the United States has made tremendous progress to improve efficiency and increase productivity while also reducing total beef and dairy cattle numbers. For example, in 1950, the U.S. dairy cow herd peaked at 25 million cattle. Today, the dairy herd is approximately 9 million cows, yet it is producing 60% more milk — that’s significantly more milk with 14 million fewer cows! Though cattle numbers have continued to increase in countries such as India and China, this means the United States has not increased methane output — thus not increasing GHG contributions from livestock — over the last five decades. So, what does all this mean? Animal agriculture, unlike any other sector, can not only reduce its GHG output, but can also create a net cooling effect on the atmosphere (i.e., actively reduce global warming). The three scenarios shown below demonstrate the important differences between carbon dioxide and methane, and their ability to generate global cooling. With rising emissions, warming carbon dioxide increases at a growing rate, while methane also increases. With constant emissions, warming from carbon dioxide continues to increase while methane no longer contributes to additional warming. “But now, the thing that really excites me, and that's the third scenario,” said Dr. Mitloehner. “So, imagine this scenario here, where we decrease methane by 35%. If we do so, then we actively take carbon out of the atmosphere. And that has a net cooling effect. If we find ways to reduce methane, then we counteract other sectors of societies that do contribute ― and significantly so ― to global warming, such as flying, driving, running air conditioners and so on.” Examples of Dr. Mitloehner’s 35% reduction scenario have proven to be possible. Over the last five years alone, California has reduced methane emissions by 25% via a combination of improved efficiency and incentives for anaerobic digesters, alternative manure management practices and other technologies. Though the narrative on animal agriculture has been negative on climate change, there is now increasing hope and new data to debunk even the most long-standing criticisms. Dr. Mitloehner concluded, “because I know if we can do it here (in California), it can be done in other parts of the country and in other parts of the world. If we indeed achieve such reductions of greenhouse gas, particularly of short-lived greenhouse gases such as methane, then that means that our livestock sector will be on a path for climate neutrality.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/3-myths-debunked-animal-agricultures-real-impact-environment","title":"\n\n                    3 myths debunked: Animal agriculture's real impact on the environment\n                    ","date":"May 28, 2020","contentLength":1510}},{"pageContent":"The Alltech Crop Science (ACS) three day field tour commenced with a visit to Grupo Toro Verde.

DHA, short for docosahexaenoic acid, is an essential omega-3 fatty acid that has made a name for itself for its role in both cardiovascular and brain health. More recently, the sports nutrition community has taken notice of DHA’s ability to help speed recovery, increase gains and improve athletic performance. DHA aids in the muscle recovery process as an anti-inflammatory agent and reduces DOMS (delayed onset muscle soreness), perceived pain and range of motion 48 hours post exercise.1These qualities, along with boosting blood and oxygen flow to muscles, may also decrease incidence of injury. Increasing the amount of DHA you consume may help decrease muscle breakdown and increase protein synthesis by increasing the body’s muscle-building response to insulin and amino acids.2Fatty acids like DHA not only increase muscle gains, but may also increase the body’s level of calcium absorption, improving bone strength.3 A vital component in nerve endings, neurons and muscle membranes – DHA has been shown to improve reaction time of athletes during competition.4 DHA also decreases heart rate, which can help improve oxygen utilization during competition or tough workouts.5 References: Tartibian B, et al.

We are not talking about normal animal smells — I mean, who doesn’t love the smell of sawdust and fresh hay? No, we are talking about the notorious stench of dirty stalls, specifically from excess horse urine and ammonia. In some cases, this strong odor can stick around even after you have thoroughly cleaned your horse’s stall. I think it is safe to say that every horse owner has experienced what I am referring to at some point in their life. But did you know that ammonia is more than just an unpleasant smell? Exposure to ammonia, depending on the level of severity, can have serious health consequences for both you and your horse, making horse stall management a critical part of any overall barn management plan. What is ammonia? Protein is an essential component of any equine diet, but when protein is overfed, the horse’s body expels it through feces or urine in the form of urea. The natural bacteria in the environment feed on this urea, which results in the production of ammonia gas. Although ammonia is not visible to the human eye, it can be readily detected by more than just the human nose. Ammonia is a noxious gas that can cause burning sensations in the eyes, lungs and throat. It has also been known to make people feel nauseous and dizzy and can induce vomiting and increase mucus production and fluid levels in the lungs. Overall, ammonia is classified as a highly hazardous gas and is something that should be taken seriously for both human and equine health. How does ammonia affect my horse? If your eyes start to water after spending just 10 minutes cleaning a horse stall, you can bet that the ammonia gas is also affecting the stall resident. Ammonia is a caustic gas and can cause damage by burning the eyes and respiratory tissues. It may also be a contributing factor to inflammatory airway disease and, eventually, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Although the complete effects of ammonia are not yet known, it has even been linked to a negative effect on metabolic and reproductive hormones. Overall, high levels of ammonia negatively affect horses’ performance through its impact on the respiratory and immune systems. What can I do to control ammonia levels? Luckily, you and your horse do not have to be victims to ammonia. The steps outlined below will help control odor in your barn and support better horse and human health: 1. Muck out horse stalls on a regular basis. Remove any wet or soiled shavings, manure and urine piles at least once every day. If possible, muck stalls twice per day. 2. Ensure proper ventilation. It is a good barn management practice to give each stall time to dry and “air out” without the horse present. Open any doors and windows, and do your best to enhance cross-ventilation with ceiling and aisle fans. 3. Design horse stalls for optimal drainage. You may not have built your own barn, but even so, do your best to avoid letting urine pool or seep. Stall mats with gaps are perfect examples of places that urine — and, by default, ammonia — can hide. Invest in seamless stall mats and choose concrete floors, if possible, as wood and dirt stall floors are more likely to absorb urine. It is also wise to use more absorbent bedding to line the stall. Your bedding options will vary by region and location, but in general, straw is the least absorbent and should be avoided unless it is being used for a specific purpose, such as in a foaling stall. 4. Dial-in nutrition. As mentioned above, ammonia is a byproduct of protein. You want to feed your horse the correct amount of protein, but do not assume that more is better, as unused protein will result in increased ammonia production. An equine nutritionist or veterinarian will be able to help you determine your horse’s specific nutrient requirements. 5. Increase turnout time. Horses need turnout for various reasons — and fresh air is a big one! Housing horses outside with adequate shelter permanently, or even for just part of the day, is a great management practice to increase overall health. 6. Look into unique solutions. One of the most effective and cutting-edge solutions to your horse barn’s ammonia problems comes straight from the desert! What does the desert have to do with my horse’s health? De-Odorase® is a completely sustainable product produced in Serdan, Mexico, from the native Yucca schidigera plant. This unique product contains compounds that have been proven to control odor from ammonia across several species. De-Odorase® can work on your farm in multiple ways: 1. When fed to the animal, it promotes protein digestion and metabolism, leading to less excreted urea in the waste. 2. When sprayed as a liquid in stalls before re-bedding, onto bedding already on stall floors or even into the air, De-Odorase® binds ammonia, preventing noxious odors and related health problems. You may not have guessed that the Mexican desert could play such a large role in your horse’s health, but De-Odorase® — especially when combined with the management tips outlined above — can have a big impact.

In a David and Goliath battle against an army nearly three times its size, soldiers outside the city of Puebla vanquished the invaders in 1862, turning the tide on a military machine that had been undefeated for nearly 50 years. France may have looked better on paper, but Mexico had a secret weapon that was far more powerful: sheer determination. Outnumbered but not outmaneuvered, Mexico showed the world that with the proper mindset, ambition can trump ammunition. “I'm a local girl, and it means a lot to me to see graduates be able to stay and have a successful career in their own community.” Josefina Garcia, manages Alltech's community projects in Serdan. While the military victory it commemorates took place over 150 years ago, the spirit of the battle of Puebla lives on. Nowhere is that more evident than in Serdan, located in the same state just an hour’s drive from the battleground site. There sits a beacon of hope that reflects the nation's unflagging resolve to advance economically, technologically and societally: Alltech Serdan. Alltech's Serdan facility is located about 120 miles southeast of Mexico City. The plant produces two main products: Allzyme ® SSF (a natural enzyme complex that maximizes nutrient release) and De-Odorase® (made from yucca extract, which reduces ammonia from animal waste). The state-of-the-art production facility, which has about 200 employees, is one of the largest facilities of its kind in the world. Construction of a new De-Odorase production facility is underway and is expected to more than double production capacity. Paul Kilgallen has seen Alltech's investment in Serdan grow exponentially in recent years. The resultant benefits to the community – indeed, to the world – show in the faces of those whose lives they have touched, he said. \"You can't imagine what it feels like to see a young person who never even dreamed of having such an opportunity actually succeed,\" said Kilgallen, who manages Alltech's plant in Serdan. He has seen that happen many times over through Alltech's internship program, which has resulted in permanent employment for numerous candidates. \"You see people here wearing 10-year pins, even 20- and some are close to 25-year. People are seeing that you can build a future at Alltech Serdan,\" he said. Local worker cultivating one of more than 100,000 Yucca seedlings grown annually at Alltech Serdan. Because Serdan is largely rural, in the past residents seeking education and employment usually had to move to urban areas, such as Mexico City, to seek career opportunities. Now, more and more residents of Serdan and the surrounding Puebla region are able to stay there after graduation, said Josefina Garcia, who manages Alltech’s community projects in Serdan. \"I'm a local girl, and it means a lot to me to see graduates be able to stay and have a successful career in their own community,\" she said. \"Before, the only stable employment you could find was in the big cities.\" Alltech's efforts in Serdan have had a ripple effect worldwide. Kilgallen offered the example of a Haitian student who, while attending the University of Kentucky, met Dr. Pearse Lyons, president and founder of Alltech (which is headquartered in Lexington, Kentucky). Lyons recruited him for a summer internship at Alltech Serdan, where the student was introduced to the company's innovative work with yucca. Afterward the student brought his knowledge and excitement about yucca back to his home country, where it generated interest. Haiti, still recovering from the massive earthquake of 2010, began exploring yucca as a means to improve its agriculture base and economy. One of the team's most important projects is planting yucca trees throughout the region, which testifies to Alltech's commitment to sustainability. Alltech's operations in Serdan have received numerous awards for sustainability work from the governing authorities in Ciudad Serdan and in the city of Perote in the Veracruz region. Yucca trees at Alltech Serdan, Mexico. Background: Pico De Orizaba, highest mountain (Volcano) in Mexico Kilgallen said there are about 60,000-70,000 yucca seedlings at the Serdan facility, which are replanted in the surrounding regions until they reach full growth. About 15 years after planting, the plants are harvested and transported to Serdan, where the yucca logs are used to produce De-Odorase – always with an eye on sustainability. As Kilgallen noted, \"For every tree we harvest, we replant three yucca trees.\" Alltech’s Investment in the People and Land in the State of Puebla, Mexico Employment: 200 (plus, indirect employment through yucca suppliers) Signature Sustainability: Yucca replanting throughout the region Community Involvement: Provide computers, classroom furniture, play yard and building upgrades for a local primary school Donate computers, toys and support for social activities at a disadvantage children’s program Have made facility upgrades and provide ongoing support to a school for disabled children Employees donate food and clothing to a regional prison Provide internships to local universities Sponsor para athletes and the Alltech Serdan football team Alltech's interns, supervised by experienced employees, are currently working on yucca products for an organic certification project. In addition, Alltech's alignment with new yucca suppliers has generated job opportunities, with about 40 new hires by a supplier in Perote. \"You can drive around and see Serdan prospering,\" said Kilgallen, who over the past several years has witnessed the area bloom into a commercially viable community with a higher standard of living than before. \"We even have Walmart-type stores now,” he added. \"You don't see that in towns comparable to Serdan. The improvements on employees' quality of life are clear, even as exemplified by the types of cars now in the facility’s parking lot.\" And, their success is paid forward. Some of Alltech's new and ongoing community projects in Serdan include aid to schools for disadvantaged and disabled children, including donations of computers and classroom furniture, as well as upgrades to buildings and play yards. Garcia and her team also help sell products made by students to raise additional funds for the schools. In addition, they make food and clothing donations to the regional prison.

As part of the Alltech ONE Virtual Experience, Robert Walker, Alltech’s European growth officer, was joined by Patrick Walsh, founder and CEO of tech entrepreneur community Dogpatch Labs, and Nicky Deasy, managing partner of global agrifood tech accelerator The Yield Lab, to learn more. The Alltech 2020 ag-tech insights report, developed by Dogpatch, examined more than 1,600 startups across 35 different sectors. Included below are some of the key takeaways: 1. Early-stage funding is up significantly: There has been a doubling of early-stage funding over the past 12 months, but mid- to late-stage funding remains fairly stagnant. New ag-tech funds are on the rise, with about $500 million more available in funding for this sector. 2. Year-over-year (YOY) tech funding growth: YOY tech funding growth has been very strong, hitting $3.6 billion this year. We’ve witnessed 40% growth in this segment annually since 2017. The top five startups in 2019 — Impossible ($300 million), Ginkgo Bioworks ($290 million), Farmers Business Network ($175 million), Perfect Day ($140 million) and Ynsect ($124 million) — account for almost one-third of all funding (worth as much as all ag-tech funding in 2016). Three categories captured half of all ag-tech investments in 2019: alternative protein, supply chain/marketplace and indoor farming. 3. The next trend in early-stage ag-tech deals: The highest number of early-stage startups were in the livestock sector. We can expect that a lot of these small early bets will become significant businesses in the near future. Within livestock, aquaculture startups are where the money is flowing, receiving four times as much investment ($162.73 million) over the next species (dairy, at $37.33 million). 4. The ag-tech industry is still underinvested: Despite seeing a fourfold investment since 2014, ag-tech remains one of the most underinvested subsectors in the global startup ecosystem, with $3.6 billion in 2019, compared to WeWork’s total funding of $22.5 billion and SoftBank’s Vision Fund at $100 billion. Walsh offered his insights: “The universe of ag-tech startups continues to grow, with more money flowing into more countries — and more startups in more countries — than ever before,” he said. “In 2019, alternative protein was the destination of most of that VC (venture capital) money. Almost one in every four dollars, I think, went into an alternative protein company, whether that was plant-based, insect-based or cell-based. And as investors get more aggressive in that space, the deal sizes are getting bigger than we've ever seen [before] in agri-food tech. “Impossible Foods did a $500 million deal,” he continued. “I think they’ve raised over $1 billion in funding now, making them worth maybe $2–3 billion. We saw an insect protein company raise, I think, a total of $172 billion, but what excites us more is what's happening at the super early stage. And what's really interesting to me is that there have been twice as many early-stage investments (the number of deals made in 2019) than in the previous year. “So, what that means is, there are a lot more people looking at startups in different industries, in different parts of ag, and taking a small bet,” said Walsh. “And where are those bets being made? Well, most of them (are) in livestock (like) dairy, and some in aquaculture as well. And that's because, I think, you're starting to see a lot of technologies moving on an exponential trend and getting more cost-effective and more powerful, in terms of capabilities, and starting to hit the right stage and opening up new possibilities.” Deasy went on to share what she has been seeing in the VC landscape at present: “Well, I suppose our figures, indeed, echo those,” she said. “The data from last year indicated that seed-stage funding in Europe was up 70% in ag-tech over the previous year. We would expect that trend to actually accelerate over the coming years. We now have the EU farm-to-fork strategy coming in, which is going to [offer] a pricing incentive for companies — ag-tech companies with sustainable technology — to improve the footprint of the industry. “So, all of that is driving a very, very vibrant ecosystem in the European early-stage ag-tech landscape,” Deasy continued. “When we started investing in 2017, most investors had never heard of ag-tech, which is quite extraordinary when you consider that the underlying industry — the ag and food industry, globally — is worth about $8 trillion per year in terms of the value of its output. “This sector is still very much in its infancy because the underlying industries that it's trying to support are huge, and there's much opportunity to improve how we do things,” she concluded. “Technology will help drive a better, stronger and more profitable industry for all of its participants, including primary producers.” How can we expect the recession to impact ag-tech startups? 1. Public market crisis lag: Venture capital investments tend to follow downturns of public markets with around a 6-month delay. Deals in the pipeline are typically being finalized, but no new ones are being made. 2. CVC slowdown: Expect ag-tech corporate venture capitalists (CVC), such as Syngenta Ventures, Tyson Ventures and Nutreco NuFrontiers, to pull back earlier and more sharply. 3. Early-stage investment advantage: Early-stage investments are usually the least affected because they don’t depend on revenue and can easily pivot. Venture capitalists are more likely to invest in them, as early-stage startups are taking advantage of the new economic situation. 4. An increase in entrepreneurs: More than 50 tech unicorns, such as Uber, WhatsApp and MailChimp, were founded during the 2007–2009 recession, and half of all Fortune 500 companies — think IBM, Microsoft, Disney and even Alltech — were created during a recession or bear market. Startups created this year could be unicorns in the next five to 10 years. The impact of COVID-19 COVID-19 will drive automation startups that sell more products designed to solve problems associated with lack of labor and social distancing. E-commerce and supply chains will become less of a perk and more of a necessity. We will see cost-savings startups that can help businesses stay alive through their services. We will also witness supply chain acceleration and automation innovation. Governments that used to slow down approvals are now pushing companies for faster innovation. Walsh shared his take on the effect of COVID-19: “One of the things we did is we reached out to the startups that were in the Pearse Lyons Accelerator [now the Pearse Lyons Cultivator],” he said. “We had 22 startups over three years, and they've gone on, since leaving the accelerator, to raise $65 million or so. Because many of them were in the middle of a growth phase, (they) were doing larger funding rounds. “It was clear that, when COVID hit, conversations stalled,” Walsh continued. “Valuations of their companies started to get re-examined and repriced. And a lot of investors (were) saying, ‘Well, we're still open for business,’ but, in reality, they were much more focused on protecting their existing investments rather than making new (ones). “But as we've moved through this crisis now, we're starting to see that the money is — for the most part — flowing, and startups are really getting demand in different ways,” he said. “A lot of the time, a startup's proposition was focused on saving costs or increasing revenue. The pitch decks have started to change a lot more (now) to say, ‘We can make you and your food safer.’ “Startups are nimble,” Walsh concluded. “They can adapt fast to this new paradigm. And they can deliver on the new needs of the industry pretty quickly. I would feel pretty confident (saying) that COVID will actually drive innovation. After an initial shock and a sense of uncertainty about what's going to happen in the short term, you’re going to see more innovation flowing now as we go into next year.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/alltech-2020-ag-tech-insights-report","title":"\n\n                    The Alltech 2020 ag-tech insights report\n                    ","date":"August 13, 2020","contentLength":1389}},{"pageContent":"Beer is one of the most universally storied beverages, with the first signs of brewing dating back some 5,000 years. Many, including the Greek, Sumerian, Egyptian, Norse, Aztec and Zulu cultures, worshipped gods and goddesses solely devoted to beer. However, it wasn’t until the rise of the craft beer industry that beer has taken on such diverse forms. It is no secret that the U.S. craft beer industry has boomed. But what of the craft brewery situation elsewhere? Are other countries experiencing a similar rise in craft brewing? A Google search would indicate the craft beer revolution is a global phenomenon but tallying facts and figures is another matter. No report has ever been conducted on what is happening internationally. So we decided to do our own survey. Let’s start with some of the basic information. We found that there are more than 10,000 craft breweries worldwide. Of those, 86% are in the U.S. and Europe. And sorry, Europe actually squeaked past North America by three breweries. Even so, the U.S. has more than 4,000 breweries, which far exceeds any other individual country’s count by thousands. Here are the top ten countries and their brewery count. We threw in the population stats too, which we’ll talk about next. U.S.A U.K. France Italy Russia Canada Switzerland Germany Brazil Japan The Swiss clearly enjoy their beer. Yet, they have by far the smallest population when compared to the other nine countries in the top 10. They also have the smallest GDP when compared to the others. In fact, according to knoema.com, a database collection website, all of the top ten craft beer producers rank in the top 15 GDP with the exception of Switzerland, which is 39th. Another interesting fact about the Swiss: Beer is not cheap for them. Zürich, their most populous city, is ranked number two as the most expensive city to buy beer. (We know you’re curious, Oslo, Norway, is the worst at €3.55/bottle.) Beer in Switzerland has been priced at €3.04 per 33cl (just over 11 oz.). In U.S. metrics, that’s about $3.68 per bottle or $22 per 6-pack. Yikes! We should also tip our hats to the UK and Japan. Both are at the top of our list for number of craft breweries and each has one of the top ten most expensive cities to purchase beer: Tokyo (third) and London (fifth). We were curious how much population plays a part in the number of craft breweries present. Turns out, it really doesn’t. Population has no direct correlation with the local presence of craft breweries or with craft beer consumption. Both China and India have over a billion people each and so few craft breweries. Even so, the Chinese beat out the U.S. in beer consumption, consuming more than two times that of the U.S., according to the New York Daily News. Chinese beer preference, however, does not appear to be partial to craft beer. Not yet, anyway.

I have been recently selected onto the Alltech Dairy Career Development Programme. This is a stage in my life that has taken a lot of hard work and involved making some very serious decisions. Five years ago I made up my mind in the final year of secondary school that I wanted a career in the agriculture sector, having got the interest from the family dairy farm in county Louth. I completed Ag Science outside of school to ensure I would have the science subject I needed to get into my course, Dairy Business. I have to say I loved my time in Dublin; I met some great people and learned a massive amount. In 2012 I had the chance to travel to New Zealand where I worked with 550 and 800 cow herds. Having talked to Alltech representatives at a career fair in UCD in February I was automatically drawn to the company. I was notified about the Dairy Programme and quickly saw this as a great opportunity for me to get involved in something that I had a genuine excitement for. Luckily I was accepted and began training on Monday the 15th of September. This week I was introduced to the Alltech team in Dunboyne. I was immediately drawn to the level of professionalism of the company, be it the people or the culture within it. The company gives off a real message that if it’s worth doing it’s worth doing right. People in Alltech also come across as genuine and I feel I could approach anyone here. So far I am delighted with the programme and the other three members, Joe, April and Han. I will continue to train until mid November when I will be deployed out to Turkey. I will be working as a dairy nutritionist on a farm there. I have heard only positive things about the farm from people who have visited it or knew about it. The farm is home to 14,000 cows with an emphasis on high intakes and utilisation. It is located 15 minutes away from Kusadasi, so I should be able to have some fun at the weekends.

And while it may seem confusing to add a third gut health moderator to the mix, pet owners are more concerned with boosting their animals’ immune systems than ever before, warranting new technologies to improve pet gastrointestinal (GI) health. As research grows in the field of postbiotics, it is safe to say that the newest member of the gut health family is here to stay, completing the holy trinity of the microbiome. What are postbiotics? Postbiotics are functional, metabolic by-products of gut fermentation. In other words, probiotics (i.e., the good bacteria in your gut) digest and utilize prebiotics (i.e., bacteria food), and the end result of that interaction is the release of postbiotics into the gut environment. The name says it all: Postbiotics are “biotics” — a.k.a living organisms — that are produced “post,” or after, gut microbe interactions. Postbiotics include compounds such as: Short-chain fatty acids Enzymes Vitamins Microbial cell fractions Organic acids These compounds act in health-promoting ways, many of which have yet to be discovered. In the pet digestive tract, the most notable postbiotics include acetate, propionate and butyrate. These three substances are classified as short-chain fatty acids, which are important sources of energy for the probiotic bacteria themselves, as well as for the epithelial cells that make up the gut lining. Short-chain fatty acids are important because they work to optimize motility within the gastrointestinal tract and reduce inflammation, which is important for the prevention of any acute or chronic digestive condition. The pet gut microbiome Research continues to find that the gut microbiome — in both humans and pets — is more complex than we originally thought. Not only does the gastrointestinal tract play a role in virtually every function and system in the body, it also differs between individuals. The microbiome is dynamic and can change dramatically due to: Diet Stress level Age History of medication use The gut microbiome is almost like an internal fingerprint, which means that digestive supplements will impact each animal in slightly varying ways. That being said, research has found that the gut microbiomes of dogs and cats are very similar in composition and makeup — unless, of course, the animal is ill (Wernimont et al., 2020). In dogs and cats with digestive disorders, such as chronic enteropathy and inflammatory bowel disease, the makeup of the gut microbiome has been shown to be significantly different in both its bacterial diversity and richness than the microbiomes of healthy pets (Minamoto et al., 2019; Garraway et al., 2018). For preventative reasons, probiotics are increasingly included in pet food ingredient lists and have been shown to assist in altering the populations of bacteria in the gut, shifting the GI tract from too many pathogenic bacteria to an abundance of good gut bacteria. While probiotics are beneficial, their use can be controversial since probiotics are living organisms. This means that, from a technical standpoint, heat, food processing and storage limitations all pose significant challenges to the viability and stability of probiotics. Prebiotics are selective ingredients that stimulate the growth of certain bacteria and, as a result, promote gut health. They are broad in scope, but the key here is that prebiotics are not alive, so they are less of a concern in terms of efficacy. To put it more simply, pro- and prebiotics focus on altering the composition of the gut microbiome to prevent disease, while postbiotics are used for altering the function of the microbiome for overall good gut health. Why use postbiotics in dog and cat food? As research continues, what we know so far is that postbiotics positively affect signaling pathways within the GI tract. As metabolites, they interact with the bacteria in the gut, the gut itself and other body systems to trigger the immune system and promote whole body anti-inflammatory responses. While the exact mechanisms through which postbiotics work have yet to be fully revealed, what is currently known about their wide range of immunomodulatory effects is good reason to include them in pet food (Wegh et al., 2019). In summary Postbiotics are heat-stable metabolites that deliver benefits straight to the GI tract. All good things happen in threes! Protecting any dog’s or cat’s immune system and overall health is simple with the combination of research-backed probiotics, prebiotics and postbiotics. I want to learn more about pet nutrition.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/prebiotics-probiotics-and-postbiotics-pets-whats-difference","title":"\n\n                    Prebiotics, probiotics and postbiotics for pets— what’s the difference? \n                    ","date":"January 4, 2021","contentLength":758}},{"pageContent":"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is the number-one cause of feedlot cattle death in North America and represents more than 70% of all feedlot death and sickness. BRD is the single-largest source of morbidity and mortality in feedlots, causing an estimated $2–3 billion in losses annually (Fulton 2009; Irsik 2006). So how do you treat BRD? First, you need to know that the phrase “treating BRD profitably” is nearly an oxymoron. Once an animal gets BRD — or shipping fever, as it’s sometimes called — four separate economic factors are negatively impacted: treatment costs increase, productivity decreases, labor costs increase and the likelihood of a BRD re-treat, chronic re-treats and/or death increases as well. Especially in a tight beef cattle market, relying on being able to treat BRD while staying profitable is practically impossible. What is BRD and how do you spot it? BRD is the general term for any disease of the upper respiratory tracts (e.g., bronchitis, rhinitis, tracheitis) or lower respiratory tracts (e.g., pneumonia). It is known as a “disease complex,” stemming from three factors usually working in combination: stress, a viral infection and a bacterial infection. BRD normally impacts cattle in the first four weeks after weaning, and it can be fatal. Symptoms of BRD: Droopy ears Fever Lethargic behavior Lack of appetite (going “off-feed”) Rapid, shallow breathing Coughing Bloody or excessive nasal discharge Four strategies for beating BRD in your feed yard A common cliché in sports is that “the best defense is a good offense.” The same principle applies to BRD. The best way for you to defend against having to treat for BRD is to have a proactive, offensive-line strategy that prevents BRD in your receiving program. Here are four things you should do to prevent BRD: 1. Reduce stress at all costs Investing a bit more to ensure the receiving health of your cattle will pay big dividends when it comes to BRD. Remember: cattle have just endured a long, strenuous trip to your yard, so doing everything you can to reduce their stress upon arrival is critical. This begins with providing a good, clean environment with as little overcrowding and dust as possible. Pay special attention if and when adverse weather occurs (e.g., excess heat, cold, rain, etc.) and adjust accordingly to accommodate them. Be sure to provide sufficient bedding as well so the animals can get some much-needed rest. The initial process of co-mingling can introduce countless diseases, even beyond BRD, so giving cattle to have a clean place to rest will allow them to both settle down and fight off any health challenges. Additionally, having your team trained in low-stress handling practices will help keep cattle calm when they arrive. This means limiting the amount of yelling, excessive noise and the use of electric prods to keep stress to a minimum. 2. Provide good nutrition early and often There are three keys to preventing BRD via nutrition. Though often overlooked, the first and most important key when cattle are arriving to the feedyard is getting them to drink water. Water is a critical first nutrient. After a long, stressful trip, getting cattle clean water as quickly as possible will help them acclimate and address any dehydration they could have experienced during transportation. The second key to preventing BRD is providing highly palatable, nutrient-dense feed. Especially during the first four to five days, getting cattle to eat much of anything may be a challenge. A good choice to include in your ration would be either a wet or dry distillers grain (depending on what is available in your region). Distillers grains are high in protein, very palatable and are generally cost-effective for a start-up ration. Sometimes, the smallest ingredients can have the biggest impact on your cattle’s health. Providing the right micronutrients to maximize health and performance is the third and final nutritional key to preventing BRD. Establishing good gut health and mineral status proactively are paramount when attempting to stop BRD before it starts. Feed additive products from Alltech, such as Bio-Mos, can help drive gut health, and Alltech’s Bioplex and Sel-Plex support maximum trace mineral status. Both of these products are backed by peer-reviewed scientific research and have been used by producers as a part of their comprehensive BRD programs. 3. Establish a vaccination program with a vet you trust Step one in this process may be developing a relationship built on trust with your vet. This goes beyond just “knowing” your vet to actually having full confidence that the vaccinations you are providing will set your animals up for success. A skilled local veterinarian is your best ally to make sure that the vaccines are working most effectively to fight BRD outbreaks. Furthermore, vaccination histories should play an important role in where you source your cattle. For example, finding animals who have been vaccinated as many as 45 days pre-weaning and again before shipping will help boost your ability to prevent BRD in the feed yard. 4. Use your tools wisely: Good pen riders and technology Remember, cattle are animals of prey — meaning that they will do everything they can not to appear sick or wounded. A skilled pen rider with a keen eye is still your best preventative tool against BRD. Not every case of BRD can be prevented, but putting an end to it before it becomes critical can make all the difference. There can be as much as a three-to-five-day gap between when an animal begins to experience the symptoms of BRD and when those symptoms can be visibly detected. This makes early identification all the more important for a pen rider. The longer BRD goes undetected, the more “catching up” an animal will need to do once treated. That means lost money for your yard. As such, checking animals multiple times a day is good, profitable prevention against BRD. New technologies continue to aid in the preventative fight against BRD. Many of these technologies still need further development before being profitably introduced, but progress is being made. Early detection swabs, drones, smart ear tags, facial recognition cameras, sensor-based hydronic shoots and much more will help reduce the labor needed to effectively manage cattle and improve overall animal welfare. Again, your best defense against BRD is a good offense. By putting these preventative strategies in place, you are giving your cattle the best chance to be healthy and profitable. Your ability to combat the number-one feedlot disease can and will make a big difference for your operation today. References Fulton, R.W. 2009. Bovine respiratory disease research (1983–2009).

Shrimp farming is a never-ending learning path, and the biggest daily challenge is mitigating disease risks while maintaining efficiency. With the increased frequency and combinations of diseases, effective management of all aspects of the farm including feed management in shrimp farming is key to producing shrimp efficiently. In light of the current market situation, COVID-19 has brought a huge amount of uncertainty to aquaculture production. Along with these uncertainties come new challenges — but also new opportunities, and this moment has the potential to change the way we farm. However, change should only occur in controlled conditions and in a sustainable manner to ensure the highest levels of productivity. Strategies to improve efficiency There are several concerns at the top of producers’ minds when making any changes in the production system, including disease risks, production costs, water quality and the potential impact these can have on profitability. In many markets, shrimp consumption and processing have decreased due to trading restrictions and reduced demand from eateries. Some producers are moving toward reducing their stock density and are adopting new techniques to reduce production costs. This trend has led our shrimp customers to implement different types of strategies to improve their margins: 1. Feed costs are the highest operational cost in producing fish and shrimp. The quality of the feed will determine the overall benefit provided to the farm. However, a good-quality feed without solid feed and pond management practices and consistent and practical feeding regimes will have no impact on a farm’s profitability. Good-quality feed and feed ingredients with proven nutrition and researched feed formulation, combined with the correct feed management practices, will provide shrimp with a balanced nutrient profile, allowing them to thrive and grow and enabling shrimp farmers to see an increase in feed efficiency and a good economic return on their production. 2. Improving shrimp intestinal health: Over the last decade, Alltech has been working with shrimp producing facilities to help increase their efficiency and profitability on-farm. By leveraging Alltech technologies, we can positively change the intestinal bacterial flora of the shrimp microbiome and strengthen the intestinal infrastructure to maximize the absorption capacity of nutrients. To achieve improved intestinal health, it is necessary to use the natural synergy between prebiotics and probiotics to activate bacteria charities in a controlled environment and apply them to shrimp to maximize their benefits. This is known as a synbiotic system, and there is a growing interest in using synbiotic technology to achieve the desired outcome. Could improving the shrimp pond environment make a difference? Synbiotics is a practice that provides the synergetic benefits from a speciﬁc prebiotic colonized with beneﬁcial bacteria through the fermentation process. The fermented products can be directly applied in ponds or administered in feed. Advantages of using a synbiotic system: Low-cost method Aids in mitigating diseases challenges Helps to improve overall survival rates of shrimp Helps to improve shrimp growth Alltech Aquate® Fertilizer has been specially formulated for the organic fertilization of aquaculture ponds. Tested in commercial environments, this product has proven to be a technology that can enhance, enrich and balance the entire cultivation system while promoting a good environment and improving productivity and product quality. In a study carried out on a Brazilian shrimp farm in the municipality of Tibau do Sul (RN), shrimp from two pools were compared: one with organic enrichment (rice bran fermented with Aquate Fertilizer and rations) and another with only rations (control). The positive results included a 30% increase in the weight of the shrimp in the nursery phase with Aquate Fertilizer, which resulted an increased growth rate and shrimp being harvested twenty days earlier than expected. Similarly, in another study carried out on a Brazilian shrimp farm in the Arez City (RN), we compared organic fertilizations with rice bran fermented with and without Aquate Fertilizer. The group provided Aquate Fertilizer showed positive results, including weight gain and soil organic matter reduction. Figure 1: Average weight variation in trials completed using Aquate Fertilizer in Arez City (RN). Figure 2: Survival rate in trials completed using Aquate Fertilizer in Arez City (RN) A balancing act The skin, gut and gills are the main barriers of defense for fish and shrimp. To be able to function optimally, they need to be supported. It is key to strike a balance between the intestinal microflora, gut morphology, the immune system and nutrient uptake. This will help to influence the performance and welfare of fish and shrimp. There are many forms of Aquate® to suit individual markets with various needs. Supplementing Aquate® at optimal inclusion levels in the diet will result in healthier aquatic species, decreased feces production and less pollution. Aquate, from Alltech, has been used in the aquaculture industry for more than a decade. This sustainable yeast-based feed supplement provides a balance of essential amino acids and microminerals to help promote gastrointestinal integrity and stability, enhance nutrient utilization and boost natural defense systems, leading to elevated performance and profitability on-farm. Aquate technologies are species-specific, addressing issues related to: Growth Feed conversion ratio Immune system Fillet quality and composition Aquate has been proven to improve biomass production, boosting feed efficiency and helping maintain a protective balance between the species, its nutrition and the environment in which it lives. Seafood provides our population with a large concentration of omega-3 fatty acids and can help to reduce cholesterol and inflammation in the body. Fish are an excellent source of high-quality protein and other micronutrients that our bodies require. Shrimp, in particular, is one of the most nutrient-dense foods available for the human population — but the nutritional quality of both fish and shrimp depends largely on what the fish eats during its lifetime. It is important during these challenging and uncertain times that we stand strong as an industry and continue producing responsibly farmed seafood that meets the nutritional needs of our population. This is now more important than ever as we all work together to contribute to sustaining the aquaculture industry for generations to come. If you would like to discuss which Aquate product will best suit your aquaculture production facility, please email aquasolutions@alltech.com. I want to learn more about aquaculture nutrition.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/strategies-improve-feed-efficiency-shrimp-farming","title":"\n\n                    Strategies to improve feed efficiency in shrimp farming\n                    ","date":"November 30, 2020","contentLength":1062}},{"pageContent":"Believe it or not, service dogs have been learning new tricks for centuries. Although the exact chronology of when canines began to aid people with disabilities remains a mystery, there is early evidence of such partnerships, dating as far back as the first century A.D. So, it should come as no surprise that assistance canines are only continuing to hone their modern-day skillsets. For the past several years, a team of researchers at Georgia Tech University has been working on wearable technology that will allow working dogs to communicate crucial information to their handlers and others, if necessary — such as in emergency situations when their handlers require aid. The team is using this tool to explore the emerging area of animal-computer interaction (ACI), which focuses on interfaces for inter-species communication. The project is known as FIDO (Facilitating Interactions for Dogs with Occupations) and has applications for both service and detection dogs. “Currently, dogs can only communicate with people by barking or through body language. Sometimes that isn’t good enough,” said FIDO Project Director Dr. Melody Jackson. “Sensors can give them a ‘voice’ they’ve never had.” Specialized FIDO vests can dial 911, text a family member or play an audio recording requesting assistance, among other tasks. How does this technology work? The FIDO team has been working on prototype vests outfitted with sensors that will stand up to dog mouths and a variety of environments, including water. These include: A touch sensor with a screen similar to that of a smartphone, which a dog taps with its nose. A rope sensor, which the dog tugs at with its mouth. A proximity sensor (like a touchless bathroom faucet) that is activated with the movement of a dog’s snout. A bite sensor that — you guessed it — is activated when a dog bites it. In a 2014 formal study, eight dogs wearing FIDO vests with multiple sensors were tested. The longest it took a dog to learn the system was 30 minutes. The fastest was an astounding 27 seconds. Real-world possibilities Vests can potentially be customized depending on the dog’s job, and messages could be tailored to apply to a handler’s disability. For example, diabetic-alert dogs might have an easier job of communicating if they can “tell” their person whether their blood sugar is at risk of becoming either too high or too low. FIDO technology may also help to expedite critical situations, such as search-and-rescue missions. At present, once a dog locates a missing person, they must leave them and return to their handler in order to lead the search party back to the found individual. With a FIDO vest, the dog could activate a sensor, thereby sending a text message to the handler’s phone with GPS coordinates. The dog could then stay with the person or, if necessary, continue searching for others. This technology could also apply to military and police dogs, such as those trained to detect bombs. After alerting handlers to an explosive, the dog could then interpret the bomb's odor signature. Using a multi-sensor vest, the dog can indicate which chemicals are present, helping the handler understand what type of bomb they are dealing with. While FIDO’s technology has only been lab-tested at this time, the development team is in talks with several companies that are interested in manufacturing this innovation. Dr. Jackson hopes that, soon, service dogs will wear these high-tech, potentially life-saving vests on the job. I want to receive more pet-related information.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/wearable-technology-gives-service-dogs-voice","title":"\n\n                    Wearable technology gives service dogs a voice\n                    ","date":"August 28, 2020","contentLength":597}},{"pageContent":"Time flies when you’re having fun and time is sure flying in Indiana! I spent the past week assessing and working with fresh cows. I looked at their feed, environment, milking procedure on the 72 unit rotary parlour and overall management while in the fresh cow pen and of course asked lots of questions. Even after our intense 10 weeks of training I still believe there is a lot to learn and what better way to do it than to ask questions! As well as assessing different protocols and areas of this large dairy, I also help to carry out daily tasks that need to be done such as scanning cows and feeding calves. This week while feeding calves the lights in the barn went out and I then realised that they are timed according to production. A long-day photoperiod (LDPP) is used in the lactating cow barn. This means that the cows are exposed to 16 hours of light followed by 8 hours of darkness. A short-day photoperiod (SDPP) is used in the dry cow barn. This means that these cows are exposed to only 8 hours of light followed by 16 hours of darkness. It has been proven that lactating cows exposed to LDPP show an increase in milk production and cows exposed to SDPP in the dry period can be more relaxed and produce more milk throughout their lactation. A simple yet effective way of managing a herd of cows that are indoors at all times. I have already learned a lot about the American dairy industry and how it differs to the Irish one. However, one of the most confusing things in this learning process is trying to adapt to the different measurements such as milk being priced per hundred weight and being measured in pounds instead of litres. It’s all part of adapting to a new culture and country I suppose. Over the weekend I took a trip to South Dakota to visit Drumgoon Dairy where I worked last year. It was nice to see all the changes that have taken place on the dairy since I left and to see the brand new dairy which was under construction, now up and running successfully!","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/time-flies-when-youre-having-fun","title":"\n\n                    Time flies when you're having fun!\n                    ","date":"December 15, 2014","contentLength":373}},{"pageContent":"In the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic, many people are understandably concerned about their health and are looking for ways to decrease the likelihood that they will get sick in the future. Fortunately, there are several easy steps we can all take to improve our health right now and protect ourselves from illness down the road. Amy Goodson, a registered dietician, addressed this subject at the Alltech ONE Virtual Experience with a presentation entitled “Preexisting Conditions: Health and Immunity in a Post-COVID-19 World.” In this presentation, Amy outlined five major preexisting medical conditions that can increase everyone’s risk of disease. However, she also included easy ways to decrease your likelihood of getting sick. “There are so many things that you can start doing today to lower your risk for any type of disease,” she said. 5 big illnesses to keep an eye on The five primary diseases and issues that increase everyone’s risk of disease are: Obesity Heart disease Hypertension Type 2 diabetes Lack of exercise “All of these things together can really put a person in that vulnerable population or at a greater risk to suffer when it comes to other diseases and health concerns,” said Amy. Despite how overwhelming it may feel to try to take on these significant issues, Amy assured that there are reasonable and straightforward ways to gradually move toward better health. “A lot of times, people hear, ‘Oh, you should lower your risk for heart disease or for diabetes,’ and they don't know how to do that,” she acknowledged. “We're going to dial in on some easy, practical tips and help you set an action plan so that you can move forward into the next healthy step for you.” 1. Obesity According to the World Health Organization (WHO), in 2016, around 650 million people were categorized as obese. Being obese can impact other aspects of human health as well, elevating a person’s risk for heart disease, stroke, insulin resistance and even some kinds of cancers. So, how can we combat a condition that is so widespread? According to Amy, the upside is that, for most people, obesity is preventable, and weight is something that can be controlled by taking three simple but crucial steps: “Eat healthier, eat less and move more.” Some of Amy’s recommendations for eating a healthier diet include consuming more nutrient-dense foods, eating a carbohydrate and a protein at every meal and snack and following the “80/20 rule” — that is, sticking to the health guidelines 80% of the time and splurging on higher-calorie foods or sweets 20% of the time. After all, man cannot live on vegetables alone, and even registered dieticians like Amy do not recommend trying to. “We want you to be on an eating plan that you can really maintain throughout the rest of your life,” she said. 2. Heart disease The WHO estimates that 17.9 million people die every year from cardiovascular disease, accounting for 31% of all deaths worldwide. While some people have a higher risk of heart disease based on their family history, there are simple ways we can all keep our hearts healthy. One of the most important things to do, according to Amy, is to “know your numbers” — that is, your cholesterol, your triglycerides and other important measurements you can learn by visiting the doctor’s office. “Many people think they're healthy, and they haven't been to the doctor in years, so it's very important that you go see your physician,” said Amy. Some other ways to improve your heart health are increasing your fiber intake, consuming more “good” unsaturated fats — like those found in olive oil, avocados and nuts — and eating less “bad” trans fats, which are often found in processed and fried foods. 3. Hypertension In 2015, 1 in 4 men and 1 in 5 women around the world reportedly had hypertension, or high blood pressure — and even more alarmingly, less than 1 in 5 of those people had the problem under control, which explains why hypertension is one of the leading causes of premature death. Much of the advice for mitigating the risk of obesity and heart disease also rings true for decreasing blood pressure or managing hypertension, including moving more and eating healthier foods, especially those with less sodium. As Amy reinforced, it all comes back to taking the small steps that have a big impact. “What we want to do today is focus on or change what we can control,” she said. Some of those changes include taking 10,000 steps every day and reducing your sodium intake, which many doctors recommend keeping under 2,300 milligrams per day. 4. Type 2 diabetes “There are millions (of people in the world) — more than the whole population of the United States — (who) have diabetes, so this is something that concerns me,” Amy said. A person is diagnosed with diabetes when their blood sugar levels are too high. Type 2 diabetes results from the body’s resistance to insulin, a hormone that helps transform sugar into energy. This differs from type 1 diabetes, which is often diagnosed in childhood and is the result of the body not being able to make insulin at all. Hundreds of millions of people have an elevated risk of developing type 2 diabetes, which is associated with a host of other health problems, including damaged nerves, worsening eyesight, foot sores and kidney failure. Much like with the other major health risks, the key to avoiding or managing type 2 diabetes is eating more healthy foods. Amy explained the importance of “shaping a healthy plate,” which should include a carbohydrate (e.g., whole grains), a protein (such as lean meats) and a fat (like avocados) at every meal, along with plenty of vegetables. 5. Lack of exercise “We know that, globally, 1 in 4 adults do not get enough exercise,” said Amy. “We need everyone across the world to get moving more.” Along with the obvious benefits of exercise, such as developing muscle mass and managing weight, insufficient physical activity is a key risk factor for developing non-communicable diseases, like cancer and diabetes. However, as many people know, starting an exercise routine often feels like a hurdle as tall as Mount Everest. “If it was easy, everybody would be doing it,” said Amy, “(but) there's a lot of practical ways that you can begin to include activity in your day on a regular basis.” To reduce the risk of chronic disease, Amy recommended that adults exercise at a moderate intensity level for at least 30 minutes a day on most days of the week. That doesn’t necessarily mean exercising for 30 minutes in one go; it could mean taking the stairs instead of the elevator, parking further away from an entrance and doing sit-ups during commercial breaks while watching TV. For those who need more motivation to get moving, Amy pointed out that exercise has health benefits that go beyond the physical: it has been scientifically proven to elevate a person’s mood. “We live in a world that's stressful, and exercise is a healthy way to really relieve some of that stress and anxiety that many of us experience,” Amy said. Taking the first step So, what can you start doing now to decrease your risk for these illnesses and their negative side effects? For Amy, it’s all about starting small. “I'm a big believer that small changes, made consistently, can add up to big results,” she said. Develop a personal action plan that will mesh with your life. Some of your first steps might include: Setting one or two small goals and working to make those a habit over the next month Going to the doctor Aiming to get three planned days of exercise a week Amy also recommended finding an “accountability partner” or someone who can help motivate you to stay on track as you begin the journey to better health. “It's hard to choose the best (food) options and exercise, but oftentimes, if you have someone to do it with you, it makes it a little bit easier,” she said. Just like with COVID-19, protecting yourself from these five major health risks can seem daunting — but starting small can lead to significant changes in the long run. “I just want to encourage you to take a step -- whatever that step is, and it's going to be different for everybody,” she said. “It doesn't have to be a big step. But small steps really can create healthy habits so that, in the future, you're not in that vulnerable population.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/5-major-health-risks-and-how-stop-them-their-tracks","title":"\n\n                    5 major health risks and how to stop them in their tracks\n                    ","date":"July 8, 2020","contentLength":1461}},{"pageContent":"The threat of mycotoxins is nothing new to the companion animal industry. However, never before has it been so prevalent and public. Most recently, the reality of mycotoxins in pet food manifested in the death of more than 70 dogs and illness in 80 more in the U.S. due to aflatoxin poisoning. This led to a massive recall of pet food products after they were found to be the source of the issue (FDA, 2021). Although pet food manufacturers have stringent quality and safety practices in place for choosing ingredients, even with strict testing procedures for mycotoxins in incoming materials and finished pet food, there can be challenges in knowing exactly what might be hiding in seemingly safe ingredients. Grain processing, sampling error, analytical methods, synergistic interactions and storage conditions can all present challenges to the pet food manufacturer when trying to accurately detect mycotoxins. A disturbing event like this recent aflatoxin poisoning further emphasizes the need for grain and feed producers to know which mycotoxins they are most likely to encounter, what risks those mycotoxins bring to the table and how best to manage them. What is aflatoxin? Mycotoxins are substances that are produced by mold or fungus. Aflatoxin, specifically, is a metabolite produced by the greenish-yellow mold Aspergillus flavus (A. flavus) and comes in four different strains: B1, B2, G1 and G2. The most toxic of those, aflatoxin B1, is a carcinogen that can adversely impact liver function and immune response. Where does aflatoxin appear? A. flavus can grow in a temperature range of 54–118° F, with optimum growth at 98.6° F. Its moisture requirements are low, meaning just 13–13.2% is optimal for growth. Aflatoxin is usually seen in corn, cottonseed, peanuts, almonds and their associated byproducts. For this reason, corn is one of the ingredients in dog food that poses the greatest risk to companion animals. All of these crops are typically grown in the southern U.S., where the temperature and moisture are optimal year after year. However, in 2020, the August 25 Drought Monitor showed that these optimal conditions spread far to the north and east, into corn-growing regions. A recent report in the results of the Alltech Summer Harvest Survey showed that this change in weather patterns has created an unusual situation in which aflatoxin is being detected at higher than normal levels in corn samples outside of the normal high-risk areas. This now presents a new set of challenges for pet food manufacturers to consider when purchasing ingredients. A. flavus can infest the corn plant through the silks at pollination, affecting the grain, and via stalks and leaves damaged by insects and weather events, such as high winds and hail. Infestation can be field-wide but is more often pocketed in areas of greater plant stress. This can make it challenging to identify aflatoxin in corn grain, as it may only be present in a few kernels in a truckload. Therefore, when testing incoming ingredients for mycotoxins, multiple pooled samples are required to accurately identify the potential risk. Stored corn needs to be dried to less than 14% moisture and closely monitored for mold growth and insect damage. Screening the grain going into and/or out of storage is a good practice to remove the damaged and cracked kernels that can be a primary source of not only aflatoxin but other mycotoxins as well. In addition to the risk attached to raw whole grains, feed producers should be aware of the higher risk of concentrated levels of mycotoxins that can be present in processed cereal by products like bran which is often used in pet food. Fig 1. U.S Drought Monitor highlighting the drier than normal conditions in north and eastern regions (August 25, 2020) Mycotoxin symptoms in dogs While no pet owner wants to think about the risk of mycotoxins, it is important to know what to watch for to ensure early action can be taken where necessary to alleviate the problem. One of the primary signs of pets ingesting food contaminated with mycotoxins is liver damage, this can occur from either acute or chronic exposure. Other typical symptoms of mycotoxin contamination in dogs include: Vomiting and loss of appetite Weight loss Lethargy Diarrhea A weakened immune system Respiratory illnesses Tremors Heart palpitations Jaundice Aflatoxin is one of the most potent mycotoxins and a known carcinogenic, and long-term exposure can lead to death, causing devastation for pet owners and their families. If your dog displays any of these clinical signs, it is important to visit the veterinarian as soon as possible. Take a picture of your dog food and the bag’s lot number for reference, as well. What are the regulations regarding aflatoxin? The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) regulates aflatoxin in feedstuffs and feeds. The current regulatory limit for pets (dogs, cats, rabbits, etc.) is 20 parts per billion (ppb). In 2020, not only did aflatoxin’s geographic landscape grow — it also impacted the total corn yield. Decreased yield will necessitate moving greater amounts of corn around the country, further increasing the potential risk with corn in dog food. Mitigating the threat of mycotoxins To identify, manage and mitigate the mycotoxin challenge in feed production and to counteract the effects of mycotoxins before pets can encounter them, feed producers are advised to have a robust mycotoxin management plan in place, that can assess and manage risk at each step in the supply chain. Modern, state-of-the-art testing, such as Alltech® 37+® and Alltech® RAPIREAD™, can help to detect the mycotoxin risk and allow for the necessary control steps to be put in place. For pet owners, where practical, it is encouraged to ask the manufacturer questions about their mycotoxin testing program and mitigation plan. With a joined-up approach to mycotoxin management, the pet food industry can help to avoid a repeat of the recent feed recalls, and families can rest assured that they will not have to face up to the sad reality of losing a beloved pet.

Craft beer fans were intrigued to learn about a brewery several hours north of Lexington, The Dayton Beer Co. located in Kettering, Ohio, that took home the Commonwealth Cup at the second Alltech Craft Brews and Food Fest. The competition is the only professional beer competition in Kentucky and boasted 350 beers from 20 countries. Beer was the name of the game for the day, beyond the excitement of the competition announcement, with many delicious brews being sampled by a wide range of craft beer fans with sampling glasses in hand, some sporting pretzel necklaces. New to the Kentucky craft beer festival scene was Tampa’s Cigar City Brewing and Cigar City Cider & Mead. Their brews, Jai Alai IPA and Cowboy Dan’s Holiday Extravaganza, tantalized taste buds. Some of favorites from the fest included a pale ale, Zombie Dust, from Three Floyd’s and a limited release red ale, Debs Red, from Bell’s Brewing. Kentucky favorite breweries including Against the Grain brewery, Country Boy Brewing Co., West Sixth Brewing and more all poured classic as well as unique brews and chatted with beer fans. From the new Kentucky craft distillers area came bourbon, brandy and even absinthe. The absinthe came from Louisville’s Copper & Kings Distillery and boasted a liquorice flavor. The company also produces vapor distilled lavender, citrus, and ginger versions.

Stress causes our cortisol levels to rise. Cortisol can cause food cravings, usually for high carbohydrate or sweet foods. Not only do many people turn to food as a comfort during stressful times, they also tend to consume more highly refined carbohydrates like white pasta, bread, rice, bagels, chips, crackers, baked goods and other sweets. Although these foods may provide quick and immediate comfort, the more of them we eat, the worse our mood gets. High intake of these foods leads to crashes that may increase susceptibility to new stress. After a spike in blood sugar caused by eating a large amount of highly refined carbohydrates, it’s common to experience mental fog, tiredness, anxiety and irritability, all of which may exacerbate existing stress. Cortisol also activates an enzyme in our fat cells. Visceral fat cells – the fat found around vital organs in our abdomen – have significantly more of these enzymes than subcutaneous fat – the fat just below the skin on other areas of the body like legs and buttocks – which is why stress causes belly fat accumulation. The more stress a person has, the more abdominal obesity can occur, which is linked to a greater risk for heart disease and diabetes. Luckily, there are other components of food that can help regulate stress by providing specific nutrients or sustained energy. Better mood foods DHA omega-3 This essential fatty acid has been studied for its positive effects on mood and protection of our brain against chronic stress. Increasing dietary intake of DHA omega-3 may help prevent the harmful effects of chronic stress and the development of stress-related disorders such as depression and anxiety. Better Mood Foods: DHA-enriched eggs, meat and milk, salmon, mackerel and sardines Zinc Diets low in zinc have been linked to anxiety and depression. A daily intake is required, as our body doesn’t have a zinc storage system. Better Mood Foods: oysters, beef, crab, lobster, chicken, turkey, beans and nuts Magnesium This mineral has been called “the original chill pill” for its role in regulating cortisol levels and its ability to prevent the entrance of stress hormones to the brain. Better Mood Foods: spinach, whole grains, legumes, potatoes, avocados, nuts and seeds Vitamin B6 An important function of vitamin B6 is helping to produce serotonin and norephinephrine, both of which positively influence mood. Better Mood Foods: chickpeas, tuna, salmon, chicken and turkey Whole grains Both simple (white bread and pasta, bagels, baked goods, etc.) and complex (whole grain bread and pasta, oatmeal, etc.) carbohydrates are turned into glucose, a type of sugar used as fuel by the body. However, complex carbohydrates contain vitamins, minerals and fiber that slow the release of glucose into the blood stream, providing the body a steady supply of energy, as well as serotonin, a “feel good” chemical. Better Mood Foods: oatmeal, brown rice, whole grain bread and pasta, quinoa and popcorn The information is not intended as medical advice.

Alltech believes the key to unlocking greater profitability in a sustainable fashion is by increasing efficiency of production. This is the driving principle behind the Alltech E=P+S programme. Alltech can predict the probable outcome in economic value and also highlight the expected reduction in carbon emission from the added efficiencies projected. The programme helps to predict and monitor the benefits on-farm, as well as clearly demonstrating the advantages through Alltech’s unique “What if?” tool. It’s simple, according to Kevin Dardis, global dairy marketing manager, “farmers look to the opportunities that abound in dairy and beef production, Alltech is uniquely positioned to help resolve inefficiencies and boost profitability in a more sustainable way.” So how does it work? Alltech’s E=P+S programme is comprised of a number of components which when taken together provide farmers with a complete audit and recommendation package for any farm unit. The first component is silage production and quality. This is combined with advice on feed formulation and mineral specifications. Then our technicians audit the management of the herd using the Alltech programme. And we carry out manure sieving to help identify the amount of undigested feed passing through the rumen in a wasteful manner. “As farmers look to the opportunities that abound in dairy and beef production, Alltech is uniquely positioned to help resolve inefficiencies and boost profitability in a more sustainable way,” says Kevin. Our technicians are fully trained in feed formulation using Plurimix, a dedicated formulations program. Plurimix models the existing diet and allows for a comparison of the potential benefits of alternative diets. All diets can be compared nutritionally, by cost and by carbon output of the herd’s diet. This information can then be transferred, along with the basic operating performance indicators of the farm, into the unique Alltech “What if?“ tool. Calculations indicate the degree of cost benefit from the resolved inefficiencies to the farmer with the added bonus of reduced herd carbon footprint, which is great news for the consumer who is more concerned than ever with how their food is produced. All of these components are pulled together into a comprehensive recommendation for diet, mineral specification, alternative protein sources and if required, mycotoxin control. Following implementation, the results and performance are regularly monitored by technicians to ensure the predicted improvements are achieved or bettered. Sounds simple right?

The ammonia concentration in poultry houses not only contributes to the smell but can be harmful for both the birds in the barn and the workers who frequent the barn. Understanding how ammonia gas is formed, the impact it can have on the bird and how to control ammonia levels can be helpful for proper poultry management. How is ammonia gas formed? Nitrogen is a component of poultry diets, via either protein or other sources. Some of this nitrogen can be used by the bird and is incorporated into tissues or eggs, but most of it is excreted in the urine or feces in the forms of uric acid (around 80%), ammonia (around 10%) and urea (around 5%). Once the uric acid and urea are excreted, they are converted into ammonia through microbial and enzymatic breakdown via the bacteria and enzymes found in manure. After this process, ammonia is readily released into the air as a gas that can be detected by both birds and farmworkers. Factors that influence how ammonia is formed and released into the poultry house environment Factors that influence how manure bacteria and enzymes break down nitrogen to form ammonia Litter type Bird activity Stocking density Manure handling Frequency of manure removal Ventilation rate Nitrogen content Temperature Moisture/humidity pH What impact can ammonia have on the bird? The results of poultry research studying how ammonia levels can impact production are varied. Some groups suggest that 25 ppm should be the maximum, whereas other groups suggest that exposing birds to 20 ppm for long periods of time could lead to issues like a debilitated immune system and respiratory tract damage. Other research suggests that, when poultry can choose between environments featuring different levels of ammonia, they choose environments with ammonia levels under 11 ppm. Ammonia is toxic to animals. High levels of ammonia may lead to observable changes, such as difficulty breathing, irritation of the trachea (the breathing tube), air sac inflammation, inflammation of the mucus membranes of the eye or a combination of these symptoms. Many other, less obvious changes can take place upon exposure to lower levels of ammonia. Studies have found that exposure to 20–25 ppm throughout production can result in increased susceptibility to secondary challenges (viral or bacterial), decreased feed efficiency and tissue damage. These changes have been noted in broilers exposed to ammonia levels between 20–30 ppm for 16–28 days. Studies of turkeys have found that, among birds dealing with an E. coli challenge, those that were exposed to ammonia levels between 10–40 ppm had more bacteria in their lungs than the birds that were not exposed to ammonia. In layers, it has been suggested that early exposure to ammonia could have a lasting effect and might impact how pullets perform later as laying hens. Additionally, chronic exposure to high ammonia concentrations may impair egg production for layers. At a microscopic level, researchers have found that exposure to ammonia can trigger changes within the animal. In poultry, high-level exposure to ammonia for 20 days decreased the intestinal surface area (possibly impacting nutrient absorption), decreased the bird’s resistance to oxidative stress, altered the intestinal tract’s ability to break down nutrients and impacted immune organs. Exposure to high concentrations of ammonia for even a short period of time may impact birds just as much as exposure to medium concentrations of ammonia for longer periods. Harmful effects of ammonia concentrations in poultry and humans 5 ppm Lowest detectable level. 6 ppm Irritation of the eyes and the respiratory tract. 11 ppm Reduced animal performance. 25 ppm Maximum exposure level allowed for a period of one hour. 35 ppm Maximum exposure level allowed for 10 minutes. 40 ppm Headache, nausea and loss of appetite in humans. 50 ppm Severe reduction in performance and animal health; increased possibility of pneumonia 100 ppm Sneezing, salivation and irritation of mucus membranes in animals 300 ppm or more An immediate threat to human life and health. How to reduce ammonia levels in poultry houses There are several strategies for decreasing ammonia in the barn. These strategies can be used individually or in combination and can help encourage good barn air quality and better poultry performance potential. These strategies include ventilation and management of both the barn and the poultry litter/manure. Ventilation acts as an in-barn air quality control, removing ammonia from the barn and bringing in clean air. This method does not, however, reduce or inhibit the formation of ammonia. Nevertheless, maintaining appropriate ventilation during all seasons will help reduce the gaseous ammonia levels in the barn and keep the litter dry. Good barn management can help to diminish the formation of ammonia gas. Proper barn management includes ensuring that the litter or manure is not wet. Several ways to keep litter from getting wet are to fix leaky drinkers and sprinkler systems; choose the appropriate litter; maintain a suitable barn relative humidity for the age of the bird; reduce the potential for condensation; and properly heat and ventilate the barn. Strategies for managing the litter and manure can be separated into two main management actions: Managing the bird diet: The formation of ammonia in the manure and its subsequent release as a gas can be traced back to increased nitrogen levels in the manure. Fecal nitrogen levels can increase if the bird does not properly break down and absorb the protein in the feed. This can happen if the bird’s diet features too much complex protein, if the bird is sick or if its gastrointestinal tract is not functioning properly. These issues can be remedied or prevented by balancing the protein and/or amino acid levels in the diet and by maintaining the bird’s gastrointestinal health. Another method to help prevent ammonia emissions from nitrogen within the feces is to use components such as the extract of Yucca schigidera, which plays a role in binding ammonia. De-Odorase® is derived from Yucca schigidera and has been shown to reduce blood urea and blood ammonium ions, reduce excessive nitrogen breakdown in the ceca and bind ammonia so it stays in the manure instead of being released as gas. When it is used in the feed from the time the birds are placed to the time the birds leave the barn, it can control the release of ammonia into the air. Managing the manure once it is in the barn: Acidifying agents can be used to lower the pH of the litter (below its usual 7.5–8.5), which will help slow down and decrease the activity of the microbes that break down the nutrients in the manure to release ammonia. Another strategy could be to use odor and moisture absorbents in the litter or manure. These absorbents, which are usually clay-based, act to either slow down the microbial activity or lower the moisture content of the litter. De-Odorase® can also be used as a spray over and on manure to help control ammonia that has been released and reduce its odor. There may also be microbial and urease enzyme inhibitors that can be used to prevent the action of the microbes and enzymes in the manure that help to release ammonia. All these strategies, however, can be negatively affected by litter and manure accumulation, litter and manure moisture, bird type, barn temperature, disease challenges or a combination of these factors. Conclusion Poultry farm ammonia emissions from manure and ammonia gas in the barn are complex topics in the poultry industry, but with a combination of good ventilation, good barn management and a strategy to reduce ammonia gas formation, this issue can be successfully overcome at any time of the year.

Vitamins, minerals, proteins and other sports supplements enhance both their mental and physical strength. Plants respond similarly to biostimulants, which can be used to activate their metabolism and influence biological processes within the plant. What are biostimulants? Biotstimulants foster plant development in a number of demonstrated ways throughout the crop lifecycle, from seed germination to plant maturity. They can be applied to plant, seed, soil or other growing media that may enhance the plant’s ability to assimilate nutrients and properly develop. By fostering complementary soil microbes and improving metabolic efficiency, root development and nutrient delivery, biostimulants can: Increase yield in terms of weight, seed and fruit set. Enhance quality, affecting sugar content, color and shelf life. Improve the efficiency of water usage. Strengthen stress tolerance and recovery. Currently, humic and fulvic acids constitute more than half of the biostimulant market, with seaweed extracts being secondary. Microbial extracts, plant extracts, vitamin B, chitin and chitosan round out the market offerings, according to the 2nd World Congress on the use of Biostimulants in Agriculture in November 2015. Other names for biostimulants include plant strengtheners and conditioners, phytostimulants, bioactivators and soil, yield, crop and plant growth enhancers. Despite their increasing use, at this point, no country in the world has a regulatory framework that defines specifically what is a biostimulant. Why are they being used? The global market for biostimulants is projected to increase 12 percent per year and tip past the $2 billion sales mark by 2018, according to a November 2015 Markets and Markets report. There are multiple contributors to this rise: Proven performance and acceptance from NGOs, governmental bodies and academia. Increased commercial customization of solutions. The need to restore degraded soil. Demand from farmers and consumers for environmentally safe and organic products that provide alternatives to synthetic inputs. Increasing agronomic production demands. Presently, Europe represents the lion’s share of the biostimulant market at 42 percent. North America and Asia are estimated to have approximately 20 percent market share each, with Latin America at 13 percent, according to the 2nd World Congress on the use of Biostimulants in Agriculture in November 2015.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/athlete-style-nutrition-plant-science-biostimulants","title":"\n\n                    Athlete-style nutrition for a plant: The science of biostimulants\n                    ","date":"April 19, 2016","contentLength":371}},{"pageContent":"Modern farmers have countless resources at their disposal that those who came before could only have dreamt of. If we compare agriculture today with what was the norm 10 — or even five — years ago, the contrast is staggering. Over the last few years, farmers have reaped the benefits of numerous technological advances, and some of the most useful of them have come in the form of agricultural apps on smartphones. The array of apps that could be useful for farmers is already vast and continues to grow. Armed with an Android, iPhone or even an iPad, they can scroll through the available apps to find a program that fits their every need, from buying new machinery to analyzing soil types. But it is not only ag apps that are making farmers’ lives easier. Help can come from some unlikely places, and programs that were not designed specifically for agricultural use can be utilized in innovative ways. With this in mind, we thought it would be a good idea to take a look at some of the useful apps currently on the market. Some are obvious choices for any farmer, while others may have previously been overlooked. Whether you are already ag-tech-savvy or are only just learning how the device in your pocket could change your farm management, this list will give you a sense of what is out there and how it can be used to your advantage. Feed-management apps Long neglected in terms of innovation and investment, feed management technology is finally making strides in the ag-tech industry. Until recently, it was still common for farmers to manage their feeding by using a pen and paper. Now, however, there are plenty of resources available on the App Store to make this process more efficient and cost-saving. 1. FeedSmart Taking into account key variables, such as maintenance requirements, animal growth, lactation and more, this free calculator can provide farmers with instant information on their livestock's nutritional needs, feed values and feed allocation. 2. InTouch Forage Budgeting The management of forage stocks has also become a topical issue on farms in recent years, especially with changing weather patterns. Fortunately, smartphone technology can also play a role in long-term planning. This app calculates the total forage available to the farmer in both fresh weight and dry matter from clamped forage and additional baled forage. The user inputs the forage required to feed livestock during the winter housed period, and the app then determines if the farmer has enough resources at his or her disposal. Developed in association with the team at Alltech E-CO2 and available on all mobile devices, this app becomes particularly handy moving into the winter, when the demand for forage is at its greatest. Farmers need to be proactive in measuring conserved forage quantities in order to avoid any potential shortfalls. Note-taking apps Whether they want to admit it or not, some farmers are careless note-takers. For a profession in which constant checks and record-keeping are essential, many farmers leave too much to chance. This task can be made easier and quicker with modern technology. On a base level, it is standard practice for all smartphones to come with some form of notepad app included. You can even set reminders that will alert you about certain items and tasks at a pre-arranged time. 3. Evernote This multi-platform app allows you to access your notes and photographs from your smartphone, desktop and tablet, syncing everything to make sure you are always up to date. It also allows you to share content with other users, which comes in handy when disseminating information among your team. 4. Google Docs The only drawback to Evernote is that many of its sharing and collaborative features are only available through a paid subscription. Google Docs, a free alternative with similar capabilities, could be a suitable replacement. Field-measurement apps 5. GPS Fields Area Measure Ask any farmer how much land they have, and they will be able to give you an answer straightaway. Being able to do so is an essential aspect of the profession and is an ability that many wear as a badge of honor. However, this off-the-top-of-the-head figure is only ever a ballpark number, probably rounded up to the nearest acre. GPS Fields Area Measure is the perfect tool for determining distances and field perimeters and areas, fast! Using satellite imaging, this app provides you with an accurate measurement of your piece of land, saving you time and money. For added convenience, it can also be used offline, and saved measurements can be shared between users. Weather apps By its nature, farming is an outdoor enterprise. The success of a harvest, down to the budgeting of forage, depends heavily on the weather. While it can never be fully predicted, many tools and devices have been developed over the years to make dealing with the weather a bit easier. Modern technology now provides the most comprehensive methods of navigating the whims of Mother Nature. There is a plethora of weather apps on the market, all of which can provide highly accurate forecasts. 6. Strawberry Advisory System monitors the weather so as to help keep strawberry crops free from fruit rot. 7. Hurricane is the American Red Cross' hurricane-monitoring app. 8. Weather Underground Along with providing accurate weather information throughout the world, this free app can also be accessed in a vast range of languages. Collecting up-to-the-minute data from more than 270,000 global weather stations, it also lets users contribute by reporting on weather conditions in their own regions. Buying and selling apps These days, it has never been easier to go on a shopping spree. A short time spent browsing online can quickly leave you with myriad new possessions and an alarmingly low bank balance. The agriculture industry is not immune to this — and now, farmers are able to get in on the fun, too! 9. TractorHouse If you are in the market to buy or sell new or used machinery and farm equipment, this global app gives users access to thousands of sale listings. Its user-friendly interface allows you to easily search for equipment and parts, which can be bought directly or at auction. 10. Cattle Market Mobile Your smartphone can even give you the edge when bidding on livestock. Traditionally, farmers would enter a market blind, not knowing anything about the animals being offered. Now, apps are emerging that allow farmers to do research and even make bids beforehand. This handy tool collects data on current auction prices across the U.S. Using this information as a guide, farmers can see exactly how much they should be paying for steers, bulls, heifers and more. 11. MartBids While only available in Ireland, this app is changing the way producers make decisions about livestock. This app works in conjunction with livestock marts throughout the country to provide users with vital information before they make their decisions. Whereas before, a farmer at an auction often had to rely on gut feeling when bidding, this mobile app negates any guesswork, helping you find the perfect animal for your needs. 12. FarmHedge For an all-around app that connects farmers with multiple sectors of the agriculture industry, this real-time agribusiness app puts users directly in touch with suppliers of feed, fertilizers, parts and more. It allows producers to create personal and secure working relationships while also saving them time and money. Farm smarter, not harder, with these helpful apps for farmers. We hope these useful tools will help you better manage what you have worked so hard for.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/12-farm-apps-could-change-way-you-work","title":"\n\n                    12 farm apps that could change the way you work\n                    ","date":"December 12, 2019","contentLength":1287}},{"pageContent":"In the U.S., pet food safety is overseen by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in conjunction with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). These organizations each have different roles but are closely linked. The FDA is charged by federal laws to ensure that pet food is safe and truthfully labeled. Misbranded pet food labels are prohibited under state and federal law. According to the FDA, a truthfully labeled pet food product contains: An ingredients list: everything used to make the pet food product must be listed as an ingredient and must be deemed by the FDA as safe for use. Appropriate identification of the product: for example, puppy food must be formulated for the nutritional requirements of a puppy. Quantity: how much product is contained in the packaging. The manufacturer’s or distributor’s name and address: to ensure traceability of the pet food product and its ingredients. Safety and quality starts with ingredient sourcing The pet food ingredient panel may list cereal grains such as corn, barley, rice and also seeds, legumes and fruits, ingredients that are susceptible to mold growth. If mold is present, the risk for mycotoxin presence increases significantly, and certain types of mycotoxins cause a health threat to pets through acute toxicity and chronic health issues. Trace minerals are also listed in the ingredient panel, but the form of the trace mineral used is very important. Are they sulfates, oxides or proteinates? Inorganic trace minerals (sulfates and oxides) may be contaminated with heavy metals such as arsenic, cadmium and lead, as well as environmental pollutants like PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and dioxins, carcinogenic substances that pose a health risk to pets. Peace of mind: When it comes to safety, a step forward is better Ingredient contamination throughout the supply chain is always possible, and avoidance and minimization of risk is achieved by checks, verifications and validation processes. These processes are all part of a food safety system designed to ensure high standards of ingredients used and total transparency from suppliers to pet food manufacturers. Manufacturers should ensure pet food safety by sourcing ingredients from approved suppliers — those who have passed rigorous quality and food safety audits and are able to demonstrate a thorough traceability system. Know your supplier inside out Quality assurance control programs such as the Alltech Q+™ (Quality Plus) program and the Alltech 37+® mycotoxin analysis are examples of programs developed by Alltech. Alltech 37+ is designed to reduce the risk of mycotoxin contamination and improve food safety. It tests for more than 40 types of mycotoxins in one sample. Alltech Q+ is a quality control system unique to Alltech Bioplex® and Sel-Plex® trace minerals. It guarantees that all incoming raw material ingredients (and final products) are tested for heavy metals, dioxins and PCBs and are rejected if they do not comply with Alltech’s standards.

Integrators therefore spend a large part of their time looking at ways to cut dollars and cents out of their feed costs. In fact, the average million birds per week complex will save an estimated $313,500 per year by reducing feed costs by just $1 per ton. What many don’t know is that a lot of the wasted money is the result of undigested feed. Many studies have found a direct relationship between feed efficiency (FE), and overall poultry health, performance, uniformity and quality. This is because FE impacts the microbial balance in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) of poultry. Proper FE has been shown to reduce the amount of undigested energy available to pathogenic bacteria in the lower gut. Further, enzymes that help break down indigestible feedstuffs have also been shown to have a prebiotic effect by producing oligosaccharides in the upper part of the GIT. Collectively these two health benefits can potentially save integrators money by improving the health and performance of their flocks. The Agristats® report for March 2015 reveals how even minor performance changes can have a major impact in poultry operations: (Applicable to a 1 million birds per week complex) Parent Breeding: Change of 1% in rate of lay represents $173,000/year Change of 1 chick produced/hen/year represents $265,000/year Hatching: Change of 1% in hatchability represents $33,000/year Change of 1 cent/chick cost represents $543,000/year Broiler Growing: Change of 1% in mortality represents $241,000/year Change of 0.25% in condemnation represents $267,000/year Getting the most from your feed Alltech® True Check™ is an example of an in vitro digestion system developed to evaluate diets and impacts of feed technology in monogastric animals. Utilizing samples of feed, Alltech True Check mimics the real-life conditions of the animal’s digestive system. Alltech True Check has the ability to screen diets or individual feed components with and without feed technologies more rapidly and economically than costly animal trials. After digestion is simulated, nutrient availability and digestibility values are obtained that can help integrators see potential cost savings.

Dr. Lyons: When I think of Ridley joining the Alltech family, I think of the opportunities to bring our technology to ranchers and farmers around the world. For 35 years, we have developed technologies that help meat, milk and egg producers. This has been done according to our ACE principle of being friendly to Animal, Consumer and the Environment. With Ridley being an Alltech company, we can now connect to more ranchers and farmers and bring them technologies that, based on the initial responses, they are eager to see. Question: How do the cultures of both Ridley and Alltech compare? Dr. Lyons: I’ve known Ridley for 30 years and, although they were recently a publicly-traded company, they’ve always retained a real family background. Hubbard certainly had a family background and Ridley coming from the Australian side also had a family background. That family-focused culture fits well with Alltech’s own history and is highly respected and appreciated by ranchers and farmers. The Ridley team also has the same intense curiosity that Alltech was built upon. The Ridley managers and technical teams that I’ve met all want to find and apply new solutions in a quick and efficient manner to help meat, milk and egg producers around the world. Ultimately, this is a perfect cultural fit of Family, Curiosity and Speed. Question: How are producers, farmers and ranchers going to benefit from Ridley being an Alltech company? Dr. Lyons: The fact of the matter is that ranchers and farmers are under immense pressure. They’re under pressure to produce more from less. They’re under pressure to avoid pollution. They’re under pressure to have total transparency. They’re under pressure to get the latest technology. One solution to these problems is science, and Alltech has a primacy in science. For example, Danish farmers are using Alltech technology to get 36 pigs per sow per annum, much more than their U.S. counterparts who don’t use our technology. Additionally, we are helping cows on the West Coast produce much more milk than some Midwest cows. By combining Ridley and Alltech’s primacy in the application of science, we are going to give ranchers and farmers access to the solutions they want and need. Question: How do the employees of Alltech and the employees of Ridley benefit? Dr. Lyons: Back in 1980, my wife and I were the only two employees. Fast forward to 2015 and we now have 4,200 smart and ambitious team members. Alltech is a private company and is not for sale. We, therefore, have the ability to be able to put our profits back into the company. If I had to identify one big benefit that relates to our 4,200 team members, it would be opportunity. If our employees have curiosity and want to make things happen, then this is the place to be. Alltech will provide them with a lifetime of opportunity. Question: What is your vision for Ridley? Dr. Lyons: We have a primacy in science and technology that ranchers and farmers around the world need and want. With Ridley, we have the opportunity to support more ranchers and farmers, especially in North America. I believe our journey together will be characterized by excitement and curiosity and ultimately take us past the $4 billion mark I’ve set as a goal. Question: Alltech has a revenue goal of $4 billion in the next few years and even as much as $10 billion beyond that. How does Ridley help us achieve that goal together? Dr. Lyons: By having critical mass, you can move much faster toward your goals. $10 billion is just a number. Are we going to be disappointed if we don’t get there fast enough? Of course not. Are we going to be disappointed if we don’t try to get there? Of course we are. When you have 4,200 people with a common goal, it’s a lot easier to get things done. Colin Powell said it best – we’ll talk, we’ll debate, we’ll do all of these things, but when we walk out that door, we’re on the same team with the same objective. Question: Well, interestingly, we were going to ask you about one piece of advice you would have for Ridley employees? Is it Colin Powell’s piece of advice or would you add to that? Dr. Lyons: The first piece of advice I would give is be open to change. Alltech is all about change, advancement and moving forward. The second point I would make is be curious. Curiosity is at the core of Alltech. The third piece is be ambitious. Be ambitious for yourself and your family. We are all now part of a great team that is committed to creating opportunity. Question: Ridley is Alltech’s eighth acquisition since 2011. Alltech also has multiple divisions - Alltech Nutrition, Alltech Beverage, Alltech Crop Science and Alltech Life Sciences. What’s next for the Alltech family of companies? Dr. Lyons: There are certainly going to be very exciting things happening in the area of algae. I was at the algae facility recently, and the team there has a sense of excitement about the reality of us being able to capitalize on some new opportunities in the near future. One thing is for sure, the opportunities will come fast and furious. At Alltech, we’ve always embraced opportunity, and we will continue to be an exciting and dynamic company. We will continue to embody the spirit of our recent REBELation international conference. I’ve had people come to me saying, Wow, what a meeting. I’ve never seen anything like it.” Well quite frankly, “they ain’t seen nothing yet!”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/eight-questions-dr-lyons","title":"\n\n                    Eight Questions with Dr. Lyons\n                    ","date":"March 21, 2018","contentLength":976}},{"pageContent":"There’s a tremendous amount of money invested in silage, from growing the crop to storing it. Yet shrink on dairies ranges from 15 to 25 percent, if not more! This level of shrink can equate to a loss of 15 to 25 cents for every dollar invested in putting the silage up. Where silage shrink occurs The largest amount of shrink and reduction in quality seems to occur at the top of the silage pile. This part of the pile is the worst in terms of packing density. It’s also exposed to the most oxygen. This enables oxygen to easily penetrate the silage, creating an environment for molds and yeast to replicate, which will lead to deteriorated silage (aka, top spoilage). Generally, top spoilage represents about one-third of what was once good silage. For example, 4 inches of top spoilage was originally 12 inches or 1 foot of quality silage. It is best not to feed the spoiled portion of the silage in order to minimize the risk of costly health and production challenges. This part of the pile, therefore, should be a major focus in terms of management. Making silage is easier said than done and is much like piecing a puzzle together. Since there are so many pieces to the silage puzzle, it can be difficult. The key factors include making sure forages are harvested at the correct maturity and moisture, proper packing, excluding oxygen and managing the face at feed out. In terms of top spoilage, all these areas can be a factor, with packing density and excluding oxygen being most important. Cost-effective ways to improve silage management: Silage packing density should be 15 lbs. DM/ft³ or more. Typically, a ratio of one pack tractor to one harvester will achieve 15 lbs. DM/ft³. Design piles to allow for more packing on the side or shoulder of the pile. Use a temporary cover overnight or in between any breaks in harvest. Utilize a mold inhibitor on the silage surface prior to covering. Cover the pile as quickly as possible once harvest is complete. Seal plastic edges and seams with gravel bags or dirt to prevent airflow under the plastic. Only unseal what you need for the day to limit the oxygen exposure of the silage. Higher quality silage with lower shrink will benefit your bottom line. Given that silage is a major component of the cow’s diet and impacts the types and amounts of other ingredients in the diet, taking steps to improve silage management practices and specifically focusing on reducing top spoilage can have a big impact on reducing silage shrink and improving quality. There is a lot of money invested in putting up silage, so it is crucial to make sure that it is put up correctly to minimize shrink, retain nutrients and ultimately preserve that investment.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/silage-preserve-your-dollars","title":"\n\n                    Silage: Preserve your dollars\n                    ","date":"May 5, 2017","contentLength":478}},{"pageContent":"Why do people consume fish? Now, more than ever, peop­­­­le are motivated by health benefits like DHA omega-3 when they choose salmon over chicken. Yet, the nutrients that make oily fish so healthy are steadily harder to come by, necessitating an alternative approach. Becky Timmons, technical director of Alltech Algae and global director of applications research and quality assurance at Alltech, will address the dilemma head on at the Alltech REBELation, in her talk “The ‘Holy Grail’ of the Industry: A replacement for fish oil.” In an interview about the upcoming session on the limitations of fish oil and the potential of algae, Timmons discussed the resource crisis. According to Timmons, the standards in place to protect marine life and prevent overfishing limit the amount of fish oil harvested to about 1 million tons per year. Farmed salmon yielded 2.4 million tons of meat in 2013 while requiring 3.4 million tons of feed. In order to incorporate 10% fish oil into the diet of the fish, the salmon industry alone would demand 340,000 tons of fish oil. That’s one-third of the world’s fish oil supply for only 4% of aquaculture production, leaving the remaining two-thirds to be divided amongst the rest of aquaculture production and the human capsule market. Thus, a production area that should be continually expanding to feed the world cannot. Additionally, salmon raised on 10% fish oil are not as nutritious as wild caught salmon. So all arrows are pointing away from fish oil and, Timmons believes, in the direction of algae. The exciting news, is that heterotrophically produced algae offer far greater production potential than fish oil/meal. Algae can be grown under controlled conditions to provide a consistent, pure source of DHA. Not only does this solution offer necessary resources to expand current aquaculture production, but also to introduce DHA into the diets of fish, like tilapia, that don’t require it. This opens a door to value-added products that would increase profit margins and offer legitimate niche-marketing opportunities. Algae isn’t just an idea; it’s a solution ready to be employed. Producers are making it work, and successfully marketing their product. TwoXSea is an operation utilizing the first 100% vegetarian fish feed with Alltech’s algae in place of fish oil or fish meal. Could this solution be applied across the entire industry? How can the pursuit of true sustainability benefit everyone: the producer, the retailer, the chef, and the consumer? These are questions to be answered during the Alltech REBELation, so don’t miss Timmons and her talk on the industry’s new ‘Holy Grail.’ Have a question or comment?","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/algae-dha-omega-3-holy-grail","title":"\n\n                    Is Algae the DHA Omega-3 Holy Grail?\n                    ","date":"April 15, 2015","contentLength":449}},{"pageContent":"By: Tom Kimmerer, Ph.D., Chief Scientist, Venerable Trees, Inc. Bison graze amidst ancient trees at Alltech’s farm on Catnip Hill Road in Nicholasville, Kentucky. Except for the fences, the scene is remarkably similar to what early settlers would have seen in 1779, when Lexington and surrounding areas were first settled. There are more ancient trees in the Bluegrass than in any other agricultural or urban region in North America. These trees are 200-500 years old, if not older, and make up woodland pastures -- natural landscapes of open-grown trees shading grasses and cane. When early settlers arrived here, they did not need to clear forests in order to farm; the natural woodland pastures were ready-made for livestock farming. After driving off the bison, the first farmers moved in with cattle and sheep, taking advantage of some of the finest grazing land in the world. Soon after the first livestock farms began, the thoroughbred horse industry began. Although the thoroughbred industry is now strongly associated with the Bluegrass, the cattle industry has remained strong. Rapid urban growth has taken up some of the pastureland, but strong land use restrictions have preserved many of the original farms. In spite of changes in land use and farming practices in the 235 years since settlement, there are still extensive woodland pastures in the Bluegrass. The largest woodland pastures cover thousands of acres across multiple farms. In some cases, there are only individual trees left. The trees are slowly disappearing not only due to old age, but also land use changes, and the fact they are not reproducing. In another 100 years, without our intervention, they will be gone. Natural woodland pastures are rare. Ecologist E. Lucy Braun, in writing about the forests of eastern North America, called the Bluegrass landscape, “the most anomalous vegetation of North America.” These are not savannas. In North America, savannas are maintained by fire and poor soils. There is no evidence, such as fire scars on old trees, to suggest that fire was ever important in the Bluegrass, and the soils are deep and rich. Woodland pastures do exist in Europe. There are ancient woodland pastures in England, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Rumania and Italy. Although biologists thought for a long time that the European woodland pastures were created by farmers, it now appears that they are older than agriculture. Wisent - the European bison - and other animals such as red deer probably played an important role in creating this landscape. In the Bluegrass, it is likely that a combination of long-term droughts and the arrival of bison created the woodland pasture landscape. Bison were abundant in the Bluegrass, in herds of thousands of animals. They would graze down the grass and cane in an area and then move off, sometimes for decades. Bison are athletic animals, often running 20 or more miles in a night, hundreds of miles in a year. The combination of heavy grazing, wallowing, and wandering is most likely what created our woodland pasture landscape. The bison would reduce competition from grass and cane and allow trees to grow in the intervals before they returned. Today, we graze livestock continuously, and trees do not have a chance to become established in our pastures. We will lose our woodland pasture landscape soon if we do not take action. The use of tree pens planted with native species shows some promise in allowing our woodland pasture landscape to continue. There may be some advantages to farmers to maintain woodland pastures beyond their beauty. Shade trees allow livestock to escape summer heat, which may be more important as summers become hotter. Large trees over productive pastures may store as much carbon as forests. These are speculative advantages, however, as there has been almost no research on woodland pastures and livestock in the United States.. Grazing in woodland pastures in Europe is a widely accepted practice that appears to provide some benefits. Trees of woodland pastures are adapted to life with grazing animals. When grazers are removed from woodland pastures, other trees and shrubs quickly create forests. There are several woodland pastures managed as preserves with livestock excluded, and these sites are now thick with trees and shrubs. The native woodland pastures cannot exist without grazing animals. We have only begun to learn about the management and benefits of woodland pastures. For now, the most critical need is to ensure that this rare and magnificent landscape does not disappear. This article is based on my forthcoming book Venerable Trees, to be published in 2015 by the University Press of Kentucky. More information on woodland pastures and the venerable trees of the Bluegrass can be found at our website, Venerable Trees.

Plummeting winter temperatures are making many dairy operations reconsider their winter survival tactics and preparation for disease challenges that can come with the change of the seasons. One challenge that can often show up in dairy herds during this time is winter dysentery. Occurring from early fall through late spring, winter dysentery is characterized by the sudden onset of diarrhea and can affect 15 percent or more of the herd. Fresh blood in the feces may be present, as well as, dehydration, loss in body condition, respiratory issues like coughing and nasal discharge, and a varying decline in milk production of 10 percent or greater, are also noted. Winter dysentery has a high rate of morbidity, but a low rate of mortality. Twenty to 50 percent of animals in the herd will exhibit clinical symptoms within the first few days and the rest of the herd within a week to 10 days. The causative agent in winter dysentery is still unclear. However, Bovine coronavirus (BCV) has been cultured from the feces of affected animals, which is also a culprit in bouts of diarrhea and respiratory disease in young calves. Additionally, elevated BCV titers have been measured in afflicted herds. Ingestion of contaminated feed or water is the most common route of infection. Viral particles in the respiratory secretions of affected animals can also exacerbate transmission. Clinical symptoms of winter dysentery typically subside within two weeks of onset. However, the time to recover the loss in body condition and milk production can take months. Thus, financial ramifications of an outbreak of winter dysentery can be severe. Recovered animals appear to be immune from the disease from one to five years, but carrier animals can be a source of repeated outbreaks. The first step in managing the disease is to stop the cycle. It is also recommended to caution access to outside visitors during an outbreak of winter dysentery. Controlling the movement patterns of cattle and people on the farm can be beneficial, as well as having farm employees working with cattle change out of soiled clothes and sanitize boots as often as necessary for their particular job. Eliminating manure contamination in water, feed, feed bunks, and feeding equipment is also critical in avoiding transmission of this virus. Besides management practices, producers may also want to consider their nutritional programs in assisting the herd to get through an outbreak with less stress. Alternative non-antimicrobial products such as direct-fed microbials and/or mannan oligosaccharides (Bio-Mos®) have shown some benefits in improving the animal’s balance of intestinal bacteria (International Dairy Topics Vol. 4 No. 3, 2005).Direct-fed microbials and mannan oligosaccharides can help to maintain healthy immune systems in dairy and efficient nutrient transfer from cow to calf. Palatable feed and fresh water should be available at all times, and in severely affected cattle, fluid therapy should be administered. Currently, there are no vaccines for BCV. In most cases, affected cattle recover spontaneously. However, measures such as proper hygiene, constant awareness, quarantining of new animals, and certified testing remain important and should continue to be used on the farm to help in preventing and treating potential outbreaks.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/dont-let-winter-dysentery-put-freeze-your-herds-milk-production","title":"\n\n                    Don’t Let Winter Dysentery Put a Freeze on Your Herd's Milk Production\n                    ","date":"August 20, 2014","contentLength":556}},{"pageContent":"Water is essential for life, yet water intake usually gets less attention than feed intake. We focus on quality, density and processing of feed, but we tend to take water for granted because it costs “nothing” — or at least does not appear on the feed bill. Feed and water are closely linked, however. Birds typically drink 1.6 to two times the equivalent weight of feed, and, if water intake is limited, then feed intake declines. Furthermore, all digestive activity is dependant on water. Poor water quality can mean getting less than expected results from even the best quality feed. Let’s get back to the basics of this element. There are several ways we can use water intake to help newly-placed chicks get a good start. Water quality profiles Minerals, hard and soft water, pH and alkalinity Mineral content, pH, microbial contamination and temperature affect water quality and intake. Water quality profiles include pH, alkalinity and hardness. pH is a measure of acidity, with pure water having a pH of 7. Values of less than 7 are considered acidic, while those above 7 are basic, or “alkaline.” Alkalinity reflects the capacity of water sources to buffer added acids without changing pH (total acidity). Water hardness, pH and/or alkalinity are not always directly associated, but generally, hard water has a higher pH. Hard water contains larger amounts of minerals in the form of calcium and magnesium ions, which are picked up as rainwater percolates down through rock layers. In contrast, soft water has more sodium ions. The challenge with hard water is that it causes scale buildup, which gradually constricts pipes. The scale slows water flow, which ultimately reduces water consumption and, consequently, feed intake. Minerals, such as magnesium, iron, sulfur, sodium and copper, can cause water rejection at very high concentrations due to bitter taste, or they can have laxative effects, whether from hard or soft water. Elevated mineral levels can be due to natural reasons or pollution. Bacterial counts and biofilms Zero bacteria per milliliter of water is desirable, but contamination is common. Coliform bacteria are of special concern. Coliforms are found in animal and human digestive tracts, and their presence in ground or surface water indicates fecal contamination. Biofilms result from bacterial colonies that adhere to the inner walls of water lines. They produce a film that attracts other microbes and debris. A biofilm might occur in patches and can, on occasion, completely cover pipe walls. Biofilms protect bacteria from antibiotics and disinfectants and can block water lines. Bacteria (including coliforms) in biofilms flourish in places where water moves slowest or temperature is elevated, like the end of drinker lines, and when water remains in the line before the next use. Using water to promote gut health Chick hydration after placing Early and sufficient water intake is critical during the first week of life. It is not uncommon for chicks to arrive at the shed dehydrated, and quick resolution is needed. Chicks drink sooner when placed near drinkers that dispense clean water at the right temperature and flow rate. Attention-getting lights and reflective drinker surfaces help, too. Water and gut health The chick’s digestive tract develops rapidly over the first week of life, and anything we can do to promote gut health during this time pays off in lower early mortality and overall feed efficiency. A healthy gut has the right mix of microbes, enzymes and healthy intestinal villi to aid pathogen defense and feed digestion. The medium in which these entities exist is water. Microbial growth and digestive enzyme activity are sensitive to pH. Coliforms, including E. coli and Salmonella, grow best at pH levels above 7. In contrast, beneficial bacteria such as lactobacilli thrive at more acidic conditions (below 7). pH varies throughout the digestive tract, with values lowest (~2) in the stomach for the digestion of protein, then higher in the intestine and colon for the digestion of fats and carbohydrates. The bird needs the ability to maintain correct gut pH from the beginning, but gut cells are still developing. A simple way we can help the bird is by lowering drinking water pH. Acidification: Prevents biofilms, lowers scale accumulation and reduces drinking water pH for better bird health Acid-Pak 4-Way® contains a citric acid buffer, electrolytes and probiotics. When added to water, it reduces pH (i.e., increases acidity), which benefits both birds and pipes. Water pH is reduced to 4.5–5.5, which promotes the growth of normal and healthy bacteria in the gut, such as lactobacilli. At the same time, the lower pH discourages the growth of coliforms. The lower water pH also helps chicks adapt to dry feeds because it controls pH, promotes beneficial microbial growth and aids enzyme production. Adding Acid-Pak 4-Way aids water line maintenance, too. It helps keep water flow steady, in addition to other benefits. Scale does not accumulate from hard water when acidified. Importantly, reducing pH by adding Acid-Pak 4-Way unseats biofilms in the water lines and keeps them from re-forming. BEFORE placing your chicks, open the drinking lines, put Acid-Pak 4-Way in the water, flush the lines and THEN place the chicks.

According to the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, a functional food is defined as “A food that provides additional health benefits that may reduce disease risk and/or promote good health.” In short, functional foods provide added value to the consumer – more health benefits in each bite. Alltech has focused its research efforts on creating a new generation of functional foods like meat, eggs and milk naturally-enriched with DHA omega-3 fatty acids using algae. DHA, short for docosahexaenoic acid, is a long-chain fatty acid which is found in the tissues of salmon, mackerel and other fish. It is the only kind of omega-3 that’s efficiently absorbed and taken directly into the cell membranes, and is an essential nutrient that helps support brain, eye and heart health. Why is a balance of omega-6-to-omega-3 fatty acids so essential? Although omega-6 (found in nuts, seeds, poultry, eggs and refined vegetable oils) and omega-3 (found in fish like salmon, mackerel and other fish oil supplements) are both classified as essential polyunsaturated fatty acids, they have opposite effects on the body. Omega-6 tends to promote inflammation, necessary in immune response, whereas omega-3 decreases inflammation, an important function in chronic disease prevention. While omega-6 fatty acids are an important part of a balanced diet to promote the immune system, an overabundance of them can contribute to an unhealthy dietary imbalance. That’s why it’s necessary for consumers to ensure they’re consuming a proper amount of omega-3 to balance the omega-6 often consumed in snack foods like cookies, crackers, desserts and fast food. However, Becky Timmons, global technical director of Alltech Algae, notes that fish and fish oil may no longer be the best source of DHA omega-3. “Awareness is growing among American consumers on the importance of omega-3 fatty acids,” Timmons said. “They are learning that DHA is essential to their health, but do they know where to find it? Fatty fish, like salmon, is the main source of DHA in our diets, but the amount of DHA found in farmed fish has decreased due to the shift in raw materials used in aquaculture diets. There are no content guarantees on fish, so are we actually getting the nutrients in our food that we pay for? By feeding animals a natural diet rich in DHA and producing meat, eggs and milk enriched with DHA, we can shift the omega-6-to-omega-3 ratio towards disease prevention levels through consumption of whole, natural foods instead of supplements or artificially-fortified foods.” Is producing DHA-enriched foods safe? How does it work? The process to producing DHA-enriched foods is simple. When dairy cows eat animal feed enriched with DHA from Alltech’s Algae Solutions, that DHA is naturally incorporated into the milk that they produce. The nutritional benefit of this DHA-enriched milk is then passed along to the consumers who drink it. Similarly, when chickens are fed a DHA-enriched diet, the DHA is passed along to consumers via the eggs or meat that these animals produce, providing additional nutrition to the consumer in each bite. The same holds true for both cattle and swine, and the beef and pork they produce. Imagine grilling chicken at your next barbeque that could help your neighbor decrease her risk of heart disease1 or making a milkshake for your child that may assist in decreasing the inflammation that causes his eczema2. DHA-enriched functional foods make this possible, and can be consumed in a tasty and convenient delivery system – the foods we already enjoy eating. How can you learn more? Becky Timmons will be a featured speaker during The Algae Opportunity session at the 30th Annual Alltech International Symposium, “What If?”, as well as at Health and Wellness Through the Food Chain, a special seminar taking place Saturday, May 17, leading into Symposium.

For instance, we can’t control the weather, but we can work to control the mycotoxin risk it presents. Weather is the main influencing factor when it comes to mycotoxin risk, leading to a variation in risk levels across the U.S. This year is no exception to that trend, with mycotoxin levels having a wide distribution in the U.S. corn harvest. Mycotoxins can be responsible for the loss of production and efficiency in our animals — a duo we are not interested in. What are mycotoxins? Molds and fungi on crops naturally produce mycotoxins. Mycotoxins are ever-present on-farm but can vary in severity based on feed sources, storage and growing conditions. The three most common types of mycotoxins include Aspergillus, Fusarium and Penicillium. Aspergillus is responsible for aflatoxin B1, which can be more abundant with increased drought stress and dry field conditions. Trichothecenes and zearalenone are related to Fusarium. Trichothecenes are common field toxins in grain and silage, and swine are particularly impacted by this mycotoxin because they are considered a more sensitive species to deoxynivalenol (DON). T-2/HT-2 toxins and other trichothecenes are the most toxic for most species, while ochratoxins and citrinin are related to Penicillium. When an animal consumes mycotoxin-contaminated feed, there is risk of reduced production, immune suppression and decreased overall efficiency. Learn more about mycotoxins at knowmycotoxins.com. 2020 Harvest Analysis Dr. Max Hawkins, Alltech’s mycotoxin and harvest expert, presented his analysis, giving an insider’s view on this year’s crop, during the 2020 U.S. Harvest Analysis. Crops are influenced by weather as we go through the growing season, leading to regionalized mycotoxin risk based on weather patterns. The Corn Belt had moderate to severe drought conditions throughout the growing season, in addition to wind-storms, which also affected corn crops. The Eastern U.S. saw above-normal rainfall on heat-stressed and dry crops. It should be noted that while the overall risk is normal this year, where the risk is high, it is notably high. These risks can be manageable if we are able to feed the average, which is why we need to do testing to evaluate what the potential maximum levels are. Mycotoxin risk breakdown by species: The 120 corn samples that were analyzed by Alltech 37+ contained an average of 5.9 mycotoxins per sample, with 50% of these samples considered moderate- to high-risk and 50% low-risk. While corn in general is relatively low-risk, pockets of high-risk samples could be an increasing concern with lower corn yields. If we are not able to be as selective when feeding corn, we may get into feeding higher-risk corn, or higher-risk feed ingredients may be used to compensate for less corn in the diet. Swine The mycotoxin risk for sows is moderate to high, specifically related to DON and zearalenone, both of which present risks high enough to impact sow reproduction and performance. Grow-finish pigs are also affected by DON, which can impact gains, gut health and feed efficiency. Poultry Overall, the samples showed a low to moderate mycotoxin risk for poultry, with the risk increasing the farther East the samples came from. Compared to swine, poultry are projected to have a lower risk from DON, but the risk presented by mycotoxins is still high enough to impact gains/feed efficiency and gut health. Ruminants The 273 samples of corn with a high moisture content (HMC) included an average of 6.1 mycotoxins per sample, creating a distribution of 60% low-risk and 40% moderate- to high-risk samples. On average, there is a low risk for beef and cattle; while the presence of mycotoxins has the potential to affect performance, overall, this risk is very manageable. Producers in the East and upper Midwest are projected to have the highest risk due to dry conditions followed by heavy rainfall. The data from 2020 suggests much more prevalent and higher levels of aflatoxin B1, which should be of particular interest to dairymen. Dairy producers should monitor and test for mycotoxins in corn silage, especially if their operations are located in high-risk areas. Additionally, aflatoxin B1 can convert to aflatoxin M1, which can be excreted in the milk, leading to food safety concerns. Managing mycotoxins There will always be mycotoxins in feed, but knowing what they are and what risk level they pose is critical to mycotoxin management. The Alltech 37+ mycotoxin analysis test provides a realistic picture of the mycotoxins in feed ingredients or TMRs. This comprehensive test allows for quick diagnosis, effective remediation and planning for future control measures. To learn more about having a 37+ test completed on your farm, please visit the Alltech 37+ mycotoxin page. Dr. Hawkins recommends testing each time you change your feed or introduce a new feed ingredient in order to properly measure your mycotoxin risk. Going forward, risk levels can change based on fermentation, and we need to watch out for “storage mycotoxins.” There have been forecasts of a dry spring, but the mycotoxin risk is fluid and always changing.

However, based both on recent findings that doing so can cause antibiotic resistance and on increasing consumer demand for antibiotic-free poultry, many large producers are no longer using antibiotic growth promoters (AGP). While beneficial in one respect, it may leave the birds more susceptible to feed contaminants such as mycotoxins, resulting in performance losses and producer profitability. Mycotoxins in poultry production have been linked with classic clinical signs, such as mouth lesions caused by T-2 toxins, yellow liver from aflatoxins or gizzard erosions from cyclopiazonic acid. Action was only taken if one of those symptoms was clearly diagnosed. Recent studies, however, have indicated that mycotoxins can directly affect gut integrity, opening the door to secondary infections, even when found in low to moderate levels in feed. A paper by Antonissen et al. (2014) indicated that vomitoxin (DON) increases the percentage of birds with subclinical necrotic enteritis and causes barrier disruption and epithelial damage to the intestine. The increased permeability of the epithelium and lower protein absorption may stimulate growth of clostridium perfringens. The lower nutrient absorption and the risk of intestinal challenges may lead to performance losses. Alltech, the global leader in mycotoxin management, has developed several tools to help poultry integrators overcome this problem. Our state-of-the-art Alltech 37+® mycotoxin analysis program is the most advanced system in the industry. Based at the Alltech Analytical Services Laboratory in Winchester, Kentucky, and utilizing LC/MS/MS technology, we conduct surveys worldwide. This enables us to determine the overall risks in feedstuffs and provide customers with species-specific risk assessments. Alltech 37+® mycotoxin analysis has tested more than 9,000 samples and found one or more mycotoxins in over 98 percent of samples. In North American samples, the DON group and fusaric acid are the most prevalent mycotoxins in feedstuffs. Even when present at low to moderate levels and without classic signs of mycotoxin challenges, poultry are still susceptible to mycotoxin attacks on gut integrity. According to Dr. Johanna Fink-Gremmels of Utrecht University in the Netherlands, roughly 60 to 80 percent of the bird’s immune system is in the intestines. Any challenge could have a direct impact on overall bird health and vaccine response. While the poultry industry’s positive move to antibiotic-free production is encouraged, implementation of a mycotoxin management program before challenges arise is highly recommended. Successful antibiotic-free production requires mitigating any potential health threats where possible, and the powerful threat of mycotoxin contamination must not be overlooked.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/antibiotic-free-production-can-intensify-mycotoxin-challenges","title":"\n\n                    Antibiotic-free production can intensify mycotoxin challenges\n                    ","date":"October 26, 2015","contentLength":431}},{"pageContent":"We’ve just finished a rewarding and exhausting four-year project, our sponsorship of the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games™ 2014 in Normandy.

The more countries Norman visited the more of a history buff he has become, so after hearing that Denmark is famous for having an artistic heritage he was very excited to look around. Norman visited Copenhagen which had so many beautiful areas! Down by the Nyhavn harbor every house was a different color, mimicking a rainbow. Only a very short distance away was the Little Mermaid Statue, Norman thought that it was an exquisite piece of artwork, and he gave it his hoof of approval. Norman then went to meet with the Alltech Denmark team, who brought him along to a tradeshow in Fredericia. Norman listened very hard all day and learnt a lot about the Alltech Weaner Advantage and the Mycotoxin Management Programme. Norman wanted to learn as much about Alltech’s solutions as he could, so that he would be able to share his knowledge with all the farmers and animals he met whilst on his travels to the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games™ 2014 in Normandy. Whilst at the event Norman noticed that Danish people are very inquisitive, everyone was eagerly asking him about the logos on his clothes. Norman was a brilliant mascot and told them about the Games and all of the exciting events that they could expect to see such as dressage, endurance and Norman’s favorite, show jumping. While working hard at the tradeshow Norman got to sample some traditional Danish cuisine. He ate about 20 warm sausage rolls, followed by about four or five cinnamon buns. Feeling very full, Norman trotted back to Copenhagen to spend some time on Europe’s longest shopping street.

In fact, the number of undergraduates participating in internships or co-op experiences during college has risen to a high of 65 percent, according to the National Association of Colleges and Employers Class of 2015 Student Survey. It also found that students who participate in paid internships have a greater chance of graduating with a job offer. What better way to experience a future career than by interning with a potential employer? More than 170 students have gained invaluable experience as interns at Alltech’s Center for Nutrigenomics and Applied Animal Nutrition since the world-renowned research facility opened in 2008. All these student researchers have completed projects impacting the company’s research program aimed at creating solutions for the global agriculture industry. From traditional nutrition evaluation trials to evaluation and optimization of production processes, these students (the majority of them undergraduates) not only learn valuable information but also gain hands-on experience and training. Many have set themselves on paths to graduate school. Others have even found their career path with Alltech. “The experience has opened a lot of doors to opportunities I had not imagined,” said Hayley Kincaid, a recent biology graduate of the University of Pikeville in Kentucky. Kincaid joined the internship program right after graduation so she could begin gaining research laboratory experience. “I never expected to be here,” she said, “but I love working in the lab.” Kincaid is working with the poultry nutrition group during her time at Alltech. “I didn’t know that companies like Alltech existed,” said Kincaid, who learned about Alltech and the internship program when a company representative visited her school. She is excited about future opportunities with companies like Alltech in Eastern Kentucky. The only problem she has with her three- to four month-internship at Alltech is she would like it to be longer. “I just like it so much; I want to stay!” she said. For many, an internship with Alltech is the type of experience needed before making a decision to pursue an advanced degree in a scientific field. Megan Dudley, a psychology major at the University of Kentucky with an interest in neuroscience and genetics research, plans to eventually pursue a Ph.D. in the field. A professor mentioned a potential internship at Alltech could be advantageous. “The experience in methodology will be invaluable when applying to grad school,” Dudley said. The experience in the laboratory has not been the only benefit. “I think my confidence level has increased dramatically from being here,” Dudley said, explaining that she takes responsibility for her research project in a new way, which will be necessary for graduate school. For others, an internship experience with Alltech is a determining factor in a career not just in research, but with the company. Amanda Sberna is the senior lab technician and marketing specialist for the Analytical Services Laboratory at Alltech. She interned with Alltech before graduation. “Through my internship I gained knowledge and skills that would help me to become the scientist I am today,” she said. “Alltech is an incredible company to work for, offering many different opportunities with your career.” For more information about Alltech’s student research internship program, or to apply, please visit http://www.alltech.com/about/careers/internships.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/alltech-research-internship-program","title":"\n\n                    Alltech Research Internship Program\n                    ","date":"March 26, 2018","contentLength":561}},{"pageContent":"There is something about the smell of grandma’s cooking, the sound of uncorking a bottle of wine and the look of a perfectly green avocado sliced down the middle. Smell, sound and appearance affect the way we taste our favorite foods. This information is critical to understanding how to solve our current food crisis — a crisis that involves the growing population, heightened instances of disease and the search for an ethical and sustainable food supply. Dr. Dan Han, Psy.D., CELM, FANA, chief of clinical neuropsychology services at the University of Kentucky College of Medicine, presented on this subject during the Alltech ONE Virtual Experience health and wellness session. How we feed the world moving forward is about more than just producing a sustainable food source— it’s about making it desirable. The way our brains analyze food and perceive flavor is known as neurogastronomy. But how can this scientific art help solve the future of food? Current challenges With a global food crisis quickly approaching, what specific challenges are humans facing with the current status quo? Dr. Han highlighted three major issues: 1. Population growth. The U.N. projects that there will be 9 billion people on the planet by 2050, and we need to know how we plan to feed them all. 2. Food insecurity. Food insecurity is defined as the disruption of food intake or eating patterns because of a lack of money and other resources. And in the U.S. alone, 13% of the population — roughly 40 million people — are experiencing food insecurity. “As an immigrant myself, when I came to the states in 1987, food insecurity was just not a part of the American dream. It was something that was unthinkable,” Dr. Han reminisced. “For a country that I love, that really hits home for me personally, so I wanted to see what I could do.” 3. Disease. Our diets play a heavy role in our health, and it’s no secret that unhealthy food options are cheap and easily accessible. However, they can also cause disease. “Because of our sedentary lifestyle and cultural changes, in terms of food, exposure and the types of foods (we eat),” explained Dr. Han, “we have, as a species, developed post-industrialization, cultural- and lifestyle-specific diseases that come from readily accessible sweets, unhealthy drinks, fast food and so on.” Some of those diseases include: Alzheimer’s disease Arthritis Asthma Subtypes of cancer Chronic liver disease Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Metabolic syndromes Renal failure Osteoporosis Stroke Depression Obesity Type 2 diabetes Heart disease and other vascular diseases “Now, I am not the type to scold certain types of food industries, because God knows I enjoy a burger every now and then, and I certainly enjoy bourbon, being in Kentucky — all in moderation,” clarified Dr. Han. “The concept here that we need to prioritize is the concept of plenty, but in the right way. But when it’s executed in the wrong way, the consequence and the unseen side effects of certain types of overproduction are going to be affecting our individual health and our global health.” Experts needed Dr. Han proposed that what we need is an interdisciplinary solution. We need scientists, clinicians, agriculturalists, chefs, dieticians and specialists in various fields to partner up and use their individual expertise to solve this global crisis. “Everybody really needs to come together and bring their contributions and put them on the table so that we can integrate them for a planet of plenty,” explained Dr. Han. Why is it important for people with different expertise to be involved in this effort? When leaders of different fields analyze their individual data, they tend to be blinded by “confirmatory biases”; there can be a tendency to read only the data that fulfills our narrative and pertains to a specific field. Preferably, various experts could work alongside one another and have a bird’s-eye-view of the full picture to better analyze the data. Reference: Cartoon of the blind men and the elephant. G. Renee Guzlas. Source: http://www.nature.com/ki/journal/v62/n5/fig_tab/4493262f1.html Dr. Han referenced the parable of the blind men and the elephant but used scientists in his example. If one expert is looking at an elephant’s tail, it may seem like a rope. The trunk? A snake. The ear? A fan. However, if they were to take a step back and look at the data they have compiled as a whole, they would see the elephant — meaning their data would feature unobstructed, unbiased results. This teamwork is necessary in order to find the solution to feeding the growing population. “While I respect all of my colleagues in many different fields, I personally have witnessed magic and beautiful data science illustrations come to light when everybody took off their blindfolds, came together and looked at the overall picture together,” said Dr. Han. Now that a team of experts has been identified as a solution to our food crisis, how could this solution be implemented? “A bunch of folks got together representing different fields and coined the term ‘neurogastronomy,’” Dr. Han explained. The combination of culinary arts and sciences Neurogastronomy is the pre-olfaction state visual data encoding, perceptual proliferation and episodic memory recall, followed by orthonasal and restronasal olfactory neural circuits interfacing gustatory experiential reward systems. Need a translation? Here’s how Dr. Han defines it: “What is neurogastronomy? It’s about food!” he said. “It’s about delicious food. It’s about food that’s in demand. It’s about creating supply scientifically and correctly and ethically so that we could address health and sustainability.” If we better understand how people experience food, we can better create a healthy and sustainable supply. Neurogastronomy is a combination of science and the culinary arts. By combining these different areas of expertise, there is a new ability to dissect the different flavors and appetites that contribute to clinical disease. On a macro level, this helps us focus on sustainability issues by “introducing this interdisciplinary concept by using what we know about flavor, smell, taste and the individual appetite,” explained Dr. Han. While it’s easy to claim that we need to introduce healthier, more sustainable ingredients into our diets, people still won’t respond to these ingredients if they don’t taste good. Stimuli such as “colors, ambiance, lighting, the sound a chip makes when you bite into a crisp potato chip” all effect how we experience food. There various stimuli can help achieve the goal of an ethical and sustainable food supply: 1. Smell. “Taste is conceptualized as flavor,” explained Dr. Han. “Taste is formed by smell. That is why, when you have allergies, you can’t taste anything.” Therefore, the way food smells will amplify taste and elevate an individual’s experience with food. 2. Visuals. The food industry needs to prioritize visual stimuli when presenting food. But this is about much more than just presenting food in an aesthetically pleasing fashion. For example, Dr. Han explains how people associate certain colors with certain tastes: White: Salty Brown: Bitter Green: Sour Red: Sweet However, while we associate specific tastes with colors, the visual stimuli of how food is served requires a different set of rules. Dr. Han explained how a study in Great Britain showed that even though red food is associated with a sweet taste, a red plate is associated with danger. When food was served on a blue plate, on the other hand, consumption increased from 114 g to 152 g. 3. The brain: Structural, systemic and mechanical issues in the brain help us gain knowledge to create healthier ingredients, a better supply and the ethical distribution of ingredients that are more carbon-neutral and good for the environment “while satiating the demand of the human species,” said Dr. Han. Hearing, seeing, smelling, tasting and feeling (or touch) are all intertwined as a network in the brain. If we know how the brain responds to those variables, Dr. Han says that we can manipulate them for a more ethical and higher-yield gain. Wrapping it up The task at hand is daunting: creating enough food to feed our growing population while ensuring that it is healthy, sustainable and appetizing. Through neurogastronomy, experts can examine how our brains perceive flavor and, ultimately, help reshape the future of food.

Here are a dozen “egg”cellent facts: Worldwide, approximately 1.2 trillion eggs are produced for eating every year. The average person consumes 173 eggs a year. An average hen lays 300 to 325 eggs a year. To produce an egg, it takes a hen 24-26 hours. Egg yolks are a good source of natural vitamin D. A large egg contains only 70 calories and 5 grams of fat. Yolk color purely depends on the diet of the hen. Eggs provide the highest quality protein, which is necessary to help maintain muscle function and slow the rate of muscle loss. To tell if an egg is raw or hard, spin it! If the egg spins easily, it is cooked. If it wobbles, it is raw. Eggs age more in one day at room temperature than in one week in a refrigerator. As a hen grows older, it produces larger eggs. Egg protein has the perfect amount of amino acids needed by humans to build tissues. It is second only to mother’s milk for human nutrition. Enriched eggs have a higher than normal content of a particular nutrient. For example, hens that consume more omega-3 will produce eggs with higher levels of omega-3. Enriched foods must follow specific guidelines. According to the U.S. Food and Drug Association (FDA), “A food that is labeled as ‘enriched’ with a nutrient must contain at least 10 percent more of the daily value of that nutrient than a food of the same type that is not enriched.” Be sure to scramble, boil, fry or poach an egg today and join us in celebrating World Egg Day!","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/dozen-egg-facts","title":"\n\n                    A dozen egg facts! \n                    ","date":"October 8, 2015","contentLength":290}},{"pageContent":"Raising healthy heifers is a key component to making sure that future herds are high-production. Poor growth in young calves strongly impacts subsequent milk production. As such, even during a busy calving period, calves should not be forgotten. There are four crucial areas to look at when rearing healthy heifers: Colostrum Early nutrition Rumen development Environment Colostrum Colostrum is the first source of nutrients, vitamins and antibodies (immunoglobulins) the calf will ingest. The colostrum immunoglobulins protect the calf against pathogens and disease during the critical time when the young ruminant’s own immune system is evolving. The ability to absorb colostrum is at its highest in the first hour after birth, after which, it begins to decline and continues to do so through the calf’s first 24 hours. A rule of thumb is to feed 10 percent of body weight (i.e., 3-4 litres) of good-quality colostrum within the first two hours, as a delay in the first feeding will reduce the absorption rate — and a failure to absorb enough immunoglobulins from colostrum leaves a calf susceptible to disease. A second feed should be given eight hours later, before transitioning to milk or calf milk replacer. Early nutrition Early nutrition is important for the pre-ruminant calf to successfully transform into a ruminating, high-producing cow, as well as for providing the calf with the energy and nutrients its immune system needs in order to develop. The golden rule is to double birth weight before weaning (at 8-10 weeks), and this is best done during the few months when feed efficiency is at its greatest. Therefore, a 40-kilogram calf should gain 0.6 kilograms per day. To achieve this, aim to feed 15 percent of body weight (i.e., 6 litres for a 40-kilogram animal). Keep in mind that, at this stage, the calf abomasum is not large enough to deal with 6 litres of milk at once. Calves require around 325 grams of milk solids for maintenance. Milk powder contains 12.5 percent DM, which translates to 2.6 litres. Calves weighing 40 kilograms being fed four litres per day (i.e., 10 percent of their body weight) can achieve 200 grams of growth per day. However, calves weighing more than 40 kilograms will struggle to maintain on this level. Milk replacer has a lower fat and energy content than whole milk, and as such, a higher rate is necessary. When mixing milk powder, always remember that 125 grams of milk powder makes up to one litre — not 125 grams added to one litre of water. Milk replacer should match growth targets. Rumen development The rumen needs to be fully functioning to successfully perform later in life. The development of the rumen is aided by the starch content in concentrate feeds, which should be made available within 2–3 weeks of birth. To strengthen the rumen wall, calves should have access to straw. However, avoid feeding a diet with a high hay content; there is a greater risk of overeating hay, which can lead to pot belly — that is, filling the rumen with hay that cannot be properly digested. This can lower concentrate intake. Environment After birth, a calf should be dried off as quickly as possible and placed in a clean, dry, draught-free environment. Alternative bedding, such as wood chip and peat, is adequate but may need to be topped up regularly to ensure it stays consistently dry. Cleaning all feeding equipment is necessary for maintaining healthy animals, and prioritizing younger animals first, along with rinsing before feeding the other batches, will help mitigate the spread of disease. Clean, fresh water should always be available, as consumed milk goes into the abomasum, leaving no liquid in the rumen to digest the concentrates. Changes within groups should be kept to a minimum, and calves of similar sizes or ages should be kept together. Conclusion Along with good management practices, you can build a healthy herd with a strong rumen and robust immunity by focusing on: Colostrum — quality and quantity are both important, and there is only one chance to get it right. Early nutrition — monitor body condition and weight gain during this period to ensure that feed is meeting the calves’ needs. Rumen development — use starch and fiber to grow a healthy rumen. Environment — keep their living quarters clean, dry and stress-free.

In most cases, a substantial amount of money has been spent on breeding and stud fees, veterinary expenses and a quality nutrition program. Additionally, each mare is carefully monitored daily, as those involved patiently wait almost an entire year for the foal’s arrival. If you and your mare have made it to the homestretch of the last trimester, congratulations! It is our sincere hope that you will soon welcome a healthy new foal. However, if this is not your first “rodeo,” you already know that the real work of breeding season is only just beginning. The last few months leading up to foaling can be an intense time for your mare, as she moves into a breeding stall, adapts to increased feed requirements and deals with the stress associated with rapidly changing hormones. Now, more than ever, your mare is at a higher risk for health challenges like colic and ulcers. So, how can you ensure that your mare — who has no doubt been treated like a queen for the last year — continues to stay happy and balanced so that she can raise a healthy foal? 1. Maintain the recommended vaccination and deworming schedules. The newborn foal derives his immediate immunity from the mare’s colostrum, which means that keeping her up to date on vaccinations is imperative for the health of both mare and foal. You will already be vaccinating the mare throughout her pregnancy, but one month prior to foaling, the mare should receive additional vaccinations. Recommendations may vary by region, so be sure to discuss them with your vet ahead of time. Likewise, you have already been following deworming protocols, but pregnant mares should also be dewormed again, both prior to and a few days after foaling to reduce the risk of parasite transmission. Speak to your veterinarian to establish a plan that is right for you and your breeding operation. 2. Prepare the foaling stall. Move your mare into her foaling stall 4 to 6 weeks prior to her due date. If your broodmare has been living the high life out on pasture, give her plenty of time to adjust to her new environment to minimize stress. The foaling stall should be a minimum of 14’ x 14’ and should be clean and protected from inclement weather. The foaling stall should be bedded with straw 1 to 2 days prior to the due date (or when the mare is showing signs of impending foaling). Straw is the ideal bedding choice for foaling since shavings are abrasive and can sometimes be sucked into the mare’s reproductive tract during birth, which may result in uterine infections and other problems. Once the birth process is complete, transitioning back to shavings is acceptable and is often beneficial for increased absorption of urine. 3. Focus on nutrition. Not only do nutrient requirements increase during a mare’s third trimester, but they are also at their highest ever during lactation. To maintain the mare’s body condition and prepare her digestive tract for lactation, slowly and safely begin to increase her feed during the end of the second trimester or at the beginning of the third trimester. It is best to work with an equine nutritionist and veterinarian to ensure that your mare is receiving the appropriate levels of all required nutrients, including minerals and vitamins, which are vital for growing horses, too. Additionally, during the last trimester and after foaling, the mare goes through more changes than usual. She is often moved to a new living situation, traveling to the vet, must give birth and is ultimately caring for a newborn foal. These changes are undoubtedly stressful and may negatively impact her gut microbiome. Watch for any signs of colic in pregnant mares and consider supplementing with research-backed probiotics to protect your mare and mitigate any potential trouble. 4. Monitor the mare closely. Once the mare has been moved into a foaling stall, hone your observation skills. While each mare is different, they often display signs prior to foaling, including: Waxing of the teats (1 to 4 days before foaling) The udder area filling with milk (2 to 4 weeks before foaling) Relaxation of the vulva and tailhead Restlessness or anxiousness Pacing Lying down and getting back up often or excessively While there are always surprises, most mares will exhibit one or more of these signs. It is best to be present for the birth of the foal in case complications arise, so monitor as closely as possible. You may also consider investing in a foaling monitor to assist you. 5. Ensure that the newborn foal receives the proper colostrum levels. Once the foal is born, the first 24 hours of life are critically important to future health and wellness. Foals are not born with a functioning immune system and require immediate immune assistance from the mare’s colostrum, or the first milk. A foal’s digestive tract is only able to absorb the life-saving antibodies from colostrum for the first 8 to 12 hours after birth. If any issues arise with nursing, such as the mare not producing adequate colostrum or the foal being unable to nurse, contact your veterinarian as soon as possible, as failure of passive transfer can be fatal. Luckily, most broodmares foal without complications, just as nature intended. However, these five safety precautions will help you support your mare and foal during these vulnerable stages of their lives. And remember, supporting your mare’s gut health can help prevent digestive complications associated with stress. That way, your mare can focus on her most important job at this time: raising a healthy foal.

In order for that blueberry to get to your kitchen, growers of this labor-intensive crop must face the many challenges of berry production. After ensuring the presence of the acidic soil that various blueberry cultivars prefer, as well as ensuring that the variety used fits into the location’s growing season demands, the battle against environmental and disease pressure begins. A slew of diseases attack blueberry bushes, but the fungal diseases that attack the leaves, branches and flowers of the plant are some of the more common problems that directly affect the plant’s yield and its ability to continue to be a viable plant for future harvests. A few of the most common diseases that affect blueberries include botrytis, mummy berry and anthracnose. These diseases, which proliferate during the times of the year that are more humid, spread when infected material comes into contact with healthy growth. Rain and irrigation help with this transmission, either by directly depositing disease spores onto the bushes or by creating a wet environ that nests the infection and fosters more favorable conditions for spreading. Botrytis Commonly called grey rot, this disease is caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea. Signs of botrytis include blossoms that have turned brown, appear to have a grey powder and begin to die off. This fungus can be spread by the wind and via water splashed from infected blossoms and foliage, and it can lay dormant on pruned branches and plant debris from previous cuttings. Botrytis poses the greatest threat to the plant at some of its most susceptible growth stages: bloom and right before harvest. One of the most important steps to take for botrytis control in blueberries is to plant bushes that are spaced far enough apart to allow for sufficient air flow. Drip irrigation is preferred in order to keep the aerial parts of the plant dry. Prune and remove infected and damaged twigs. Mummy berry disease Another fungal disease that makes flowers turn brown and die off, mummy berry disease also produces blackened marks on leaves that eventually wilt and die. Mature fruit that is Infected will become grey and hard and will fall off the bushes before harvesting time. Since this disease can be transmitted to healthy flowers through pollinating insects, wind and rain and can be transferred to new growth through fallen infected berries, one of the more effective ways to combat mummy berry disease is to keep the fallen infected berries from being able to access the plant. This can be accomplished by removing or burying mummified berries from under and around the plant by cultivating the soil underneath the bushes. While time consuming, harvesting and destroying mummified berries before they drop to the ground can be very effective for mitigating infection. Anthracnose Plants infected with ripe rot, or anthracnose, may not show any symptoms until after harvest. This is a tricky disease that spends the winter months hiding in infected twigs, older growth and live buds. New infections occur in humid conditions, when rain and irrigation can transfer spores, most often between the flowering and berry development phases. If any symptoms manifest prior to harvest, they will appear near the time of berry maturation, and a few flowers may wilt and turn brown, or the flower part of the berry may soften. The greater danger with anthracnose comes during post-harvest, when berries are packaged and stored; salmon-colored spores will appear on the berries and spread to other berries in the same package. Mitigation strategies for anthracnose are similar to those for botrytis: Separate bushes to create more space between each plant; drip irrigate; and increase the air flow in the plant through pruning. Additionally, quickly move harvested fruit to cold storage. Growers can also use fungicides to help limit the spread of these diseases. However, with the future of many fungicides in question, what else can growers do to help their blueberry bushes? Once the practices that create physical barriers for fungal infections, such as plant spacing, have been implemented, the focus should turn to the plants themselves. After planting and during the growth phases, it is important to ensure that the plant’s nutritional needs are met. Well-nourished plants are more capable of resisting environmental and disease pressures. Growers can complement their existing fungicide programs with biostimulant nutritional aids, such as AGRO-MOS, maximizing plants defense mechanisms.

These microorganisms include bacteria, yeast, fungi and protozoa. Bacteria are thought to play the most important functional role. This microbial community not only impacts the equine digestive tract but also plays an instrumental role in immune and endocrine response, cognitive function and behavior. Researchers have been working for many years to identify specific gut microbes and learn more about their functionality in order to further understand the role of the equine digestive system in both disease prevention and treatment. “Studying the equine intestinal microbiome is important because horses are hindgut fermenters,” said Scott Weese, DVM, M.Sc., Dipl. ACVIM, a professor in the department of pathobiology at the University of Guelph’s Ontario Veterinary College. “Changes in the microbiome can result in diseases such as colic, colitis and laminitis, which are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in horses.” Influential factors Each horse’s gut is unique to them, with the microbiota structure beginning to take shape within the first few days of life. The overall gut microbiome is influenced by several factors, including age, genetics, diet, exercise, stress, body condition and the horse’s environment. Interestingly, the microbiomes of wild horses include a more diverse spectrum of microbiota than domesticated horses (Fig. 1). Beyond age, differences in housing and pasture habits, the composition of their feeding diets, contact with humans, veterinary healthcare and medication seem to be among the most influencing factors for equine microbiomes (Kauter, A., Epping, L., Semmler, T. et al., 2019). ​ Figure 1. The microbiomes of non-domesticated horses (left) include a more diverse spectrum of microbiota compared to those of domesticated horses (right). At present, scientists believe that hindgut microbiota are largely responsible for: Fiber digestion and the breakdown of structural carbohydrates, such as those found in grass, hay, beet pulp and other forages. This process results in the production of volatile fatty acids, which are then converted to energy. Hindgut forage fermentation provides up to 70% of a horse’s energy requirements. Enhancing immune ­functions by helping to neutralize potential toxins and protect the horse from an overgrowth of pathogenic organisms. For example, an overabundance of Proteobacteria is reported to be associated with inflammatory intestinal diseases and dysbiosis, such as colic (Kauter, A., Epping, L., Semmler, T. et al., 2019). Imbalanced microbiota are also linked to other horse diseases, such as colitis, laminitis, equine gastric ulcer disease and equine metabolic syndrome. Promoting gut-brain connectivity, which influences behavior. In addition to protecting horses from pathogens, microbiota produce fatty acids (as noted above), hormones, cytokines and neurotransmitters. Through these various chemical pathways, microbes affect the equine mood. Keeping the hindgut properly balanced is imperative to horse health. Although some highly influencing factors, such as age, are beyond control, there are a few things you can do to encourage a happy hindgut. 1. Focus on forage. Forage should make up the majority of your horse’s diet. Feed only high-quality hay and/or grasses, and offer free-choice, if possible. The equine digestive system is designed for an almost constant, slow intake of forage, which helps to maintain proper hindgut pH levels. This is critical to influencing the abundance of good gut microbes, such as fiber-fermenting bacteria. 2. Don’t go overboard on grain. Some horses require more calories and nutrients than forage alone can provide, but grain is often high in sugar and starch, which is difficult for the hindgut to digest. This can have an adverse effect on pH and bacteria levels. 3. Provide plenty of exercise. Activity helps to stimulate gut motility and can reduce the risk of impactions and gas buildup. Offer stalled horses the opportunity to be at liberty, ideally through daily turnout, in addition to regular work in your preferred form (e.g., riding or driving). 4. Offer constant access to fresh, clean drinking water. Most horses will naturally drink what they need when given access to clean water. Chewing and digesting dry forage alone requires a lot of water, but keeping enough fluid in their systems to keep ingested food moving is also crucial. If there's not enough water present, these substances can dry up and block the further flow of food, leading to potentially fatal impaction colic. With proper feeding and management practices, a healthy microbiome contributes to good digestion, as well as improved immune and neurological function. When imbalanced, it can result in serious and potentially fatal disorders. Therefore, we must do our utmost to ensure that we are taking the necessary steps to contribute to a healthy microbial population, which will, in turn, help result in a healthier horse.

You can choose eggs based on color, eggs based on size, enriched eggs, and eggs from hens raised in a variety different production systems. Price, of course, may be the most basic difference, and it’s linked to all of your other choices. Today is World Egg Day, celebrated on the second Friday of every October. It's a day to celebrate egg farmers and promote the incredible edible egg. To celebrate, let’s discuss the large array of choices on the market. Eggs are a ubiquitous source of delicious protein for people around the world, but many people aren’t sure of the differences between the types of eggs that are available. So really, how are all these eggs different? Let’s break down the list. Color There is no nutritional difference between a white and brown egg of the same size. So pick whichever your heart desires. Size This is pretty self-explanatory. Eggs are usually labeled as medium, large, extra large or jumbo. Differences in egg size are largely due the age of the hen, though sometimes it is related to the strain or breed as well. Enriched eggs Enriched eggs have a higher than normal content of a particular nutrient. For example, hens that consume more Omega-3 will produce eggs with higher levels of Omega-3. Enriched foods must follow specific guidelines. According to the FDA, “A food that is labeled as ‘enriched’ with a nutrient must contain at least 10 percent more of the Daily Value of that nutrient than a food of the same type that is not enriched.” Different production systems First, there are conventionally raised hens. This traditional way of raising hens has been going on since the 1950s. Hens are raised in cages, with five to eight birds per cage. This system has been used for many years, and farmers excel at taking care of their hens under this production system. Cage-free eggs are also common. These hens are still raised indoors, but not in cages. Another familiar label on the market is free-range. These hens are raised in a big barn with 24-hour access to the outdoors, as long as the weather permits. Finally, there are organic eggs. These hens are raised just liked free-range hens; but their feed is different. Organically raised hens have a strict set of rules on their diet set by the USDA. Who ever would have guessed that there is so much to know about eggs? If you’d like to learn more about eggs, you can check the USDA’s site or the American Egg Board site. You can learn more about Alltech’s work with egg farmers here. Now that you have a better idea of the choices out there, you can buy some eggs and celebrate World Egg Day!

Already, autonomous robots are taking over the milking of cows, grading of fruit and vegetables and many other duties on farms around the world. Advancements in electric-powered vehicles could also mean that, before long, we will be enjoying the near-silent purr of electric, eco-friendly tractors in our fields. With $2 billion invested in ag-tech in 2018, this is just the tip of the agriculture technology iceberg! As far as innovation and investment go, however, there is one section of the industry that is struggling to keep up with the rest: feed management technology. At the same time that drones are surveying our land and self-driving machines are harvesting our crops, many farmers are still managing their feeding using old, outdated technologies — or, in some cases, pen and paper. This seems to be a major oversight of the industry, considering the potential savings and efficiencies at stake. Animal feed and nutrition is one of the most critical areas on livestock farms, accounting for up to 70% of the cost of production (COP). A modern solution that could help to increase feed efficiency should be shouted from the rooftops! Thankfully, while feed management technology may be bringing up the rear in terms of innovation, it still has not dropped out of the race altogether. There are many established names currently offering platforms that are both effective and affordable. The benefits of using modern feed management tools are indisputable. Both in the long and the short term, updating your methods of managing feed on-farm has the potential to improve not only herd output but also overall herd health. Maximize income over feed cost (IOFC) IOFC is a critical measure in driving farm profitability. One of the key benefits of using feed management technology is the ability to continually track and maximize this figure. Central features of such a platform include the precise loading of individual ingredients and the subsequent TMR mixing, tracking of feed intakes, management of feed costs and the direct linking of outputs to inputs — all contributory factors in optimizing IOFC. Where IOFC is not meeting targets, problems are quickly identified, and necessary changes can be made in real time. Feed inventory management Keeping track of feed inventory on-farm is a notoriously manual task that usually involves significant guesswork. This leads to farmers carrying too much feed, tying up both space and capital, or too little feed, which presents a whole different set of management challenges. Feed inventory management is a common feature within most feed management platforms, allowing farmers to accurately monitor and balance quantities of feed given to the animals against quantities of feed held on-farm. Depending on the system, automatic alerts notify when stock levels reach a certain point, and in some cases, automatic re-ordering (via links to feed mills) can be set up. Cows crave consistency What is the one thing that cows love more than anything else? Consistency. Cows are creatures of habit, and a consistent management routine leads to optimal dairy production. This is especially true for feeding; the more consistent a cow's daily diet, the better the cow will perform in terms of milk output, fertility and overall health. Any disruption to a cow’s rumen environment can quickly result in sub-optimal output, an issue that can take weeks to reverse. Feed management technology allows for the precise loading and feed-out of each ration, ensuring that animals will receive a consistent diet every day. When combined with a diet feeder, such as a KEENAN MechFiber, the software can tell farmers the optimal loading order of the ration. This means that the end product is the best-quality mix possible. It also helps to negate any human error, so no matter who is loading the machine, the result is always the same. Make it easy for anyone to do the feeding On most farms, there is usually one person assigned to manage the feeding operation and ensure that the correct protocols are followed each day. However, what happens if that person is not available and the person who fills in is not as attentive to good feeding practices? Overall cow performance and health can quickly suffer if diets change from one user to the next. Using technology to manage feeding on-farm ensures that, no matter who is in charge, once they follow the loading and unloading instructions provided by the feeding system, diet consistency should not be compromised. This guide to TMR feeding is almost foolproof. Equally, as all data is recorded, it is easy to identify if labor performance has not met the expected standards. Control of feed cost Of course, there is another major benefit to this precision: control of feed cost. This is where feed management software can really make a difference on-farm. By taking stock of what ration goes into the mix, as well as the amount, the program can keep on top of costs, so the farmer knows exactly how much they are spending. Beyond this, by ensuring that the animal's diet offers optimal efficiency, further savings can be made by removing wasted feedstock from the process. Progress reporting and data-sharing The abilities of feed management software go far beyond the day-to-day running of a farm. As it is monitoring diets and ration stocks, the program is also recording and storing all of the data it collects. This means that farmers have access to a library of information at the push of a button. They can generate detailed graphs and reports that illustrate what has gone before, helping them to make informed decisions about the future. Bringing this feature one step further is the cloud-based technology of modern feed management software. By availing of these wireless capabilities, farmers can share information and data with employees, meaning that everyone can be kept up-to-date and share advice. Equally, where access to the technology is provided to the farm’s third-party consultants, communication is improved, and adjustments to animal diets can be made in a more proactive and timely manner, without the need for consultants to be on-farm. Adaptability Another great benefit to the cloud-based aspect of modern feed management software is that it opens the program up to previously unseen flexibility and adaptability. Many programs can now link up and operate in conjunction with other management software that a farmer may be using. For example, a farmer in the dairy industry may be using one program for feed and another for herd and milk production. By allowing these programs to work in tandem, dairy farm data management becomes more streamlined, saves time and, most importantly, allows for the generation of more actionable insights. The thing to remember is that the points outlined here are not just something that farmers can hope to take advantage of in the future. There are already numerous established companies offering technologies to help deliver on these promises. Furthermore, there is a noticeable upsurge of dairy ag-tech startups advancing on the pre-existing technology, meaning that dairy automated feeding technology might finally reach its much-needed potential in terms of agricultural innovation. One such platform is InTouch. Cloud-based and combining the latest in hardware and software, InTouch manages the feeding of over 300,000 cows in 37 countries worldwide each day. As part of Alltech, InTouch utilizes user-friendly dashboards and reporting tools to provide farmers and nutritionists with the most relevant insights and analytics for delivering optimum nutrition to the herd. Collaboration with other on-farm technologies is a key principle of InTouch, which is the reason behind the recent announcement of its integration with UNIFORM-Agri, one of the world’s leading herd-management software providers. Collaborations like this reduce the need for the manual input of data, deliver more effective insights and ultimately enable both farmers and nutritionists to work together to make more informed herd-management decisions. Continuing the tradition of innovation at InTouch, the team showcased InTouchGo at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference in 2019. Currently in the proof-of-concept stage, this all-new technology uses advanced analytics and features — like machine learning — to deliver automatic ration recommendations directly to the farmer’s smartphone in response to changes in milk output. Alltech’s commitment to a Planet of Plenty™ also features in the InTouch vision. Modern agriculture is under continuous pressure to demonstrate its sustainability credentials, and increased animal productivity has been shown to reduce the amount of methane produced per unit of milk or meat. Feed conversion efficiency, one of the most widely used measures of animal productivity, is the measure by which livestock convert feed into milk or meat. Adapting technologies like InTouch to increase feed conversion efficiency as part of a wider on-farm nutritional strategy may be one solution to this growing and complex challenge.

From improper food storage to cross contamination on the cutting board, the opportunities to cause sickness and food poisoning are plentiful. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year, foodborne illnesses: Affect 1 in 10 people. Cause 33 million healthy life years to be lost. Result in 125,000 deaths of children under five. When these illnesses are profiled, it becomes apparent that Campylobacter and Salmonella are huge issues, accounting for 38% and 35% of illnesses, respectively, despite there being a plethora of other potential pathogens. They can both be found in multiple species but are commonly discussed in the poultry industry due to how they interact with birds. Consumers are told that thorough cooking of food will stop the transmission of these pathogens, but early steps can also be taken to control Campylobacter and Salmonella in poultry production and processing. The journey of infection While they can cause huge human health problems if they invade the human gastrointestinal (GI) tract, these bacterial organisms are normally asymptomatic in the bird. Campylobacter infection reaches a rapid growth phase in the higher body temperature of birds, which is why birds act as a big reservoir for infection. The bacteria are then passed on to humans, where they invade the GI tract. Salmonella is transmitted both horizontally (bird to bird) and vertically (from mother to chick through the egg). Both pathogens bind to attachment sites on the epithelial cells of the gut wall. Go with the gut Gut health and the microbiota can have a significant impact on pathogen colonization and, as a result, transmission. The microbiome is a complex subject, but it is well-documented through research that the microbiota and the gut interact with each other. The microbiota affects: Nutrition and growth. Intestinal morphology. Immunity. Immunity is a hugely important factor when considering animal performance. An immune response is incredibly energetically expensive and detracts energy away from growth or egg production. Of a bird’s immune system, 70% operates through the gut. Ensuring that gut health and the microbiota are working effectively together is crucial to ensuring that immunity is fully functional. Many factors can influence the microbiota and, hence, the immune status of an animal, including: Feed and nutrition. The environment. Medication. Commonly, when abiotic or biotic stressors are allowed into the production system — or, for example, if antibiotics are used — the diversity of the microbiota is reduced, which then makes it easier for unfavorable or pathogenic organisms to proliferate and invade. Bacteria produce their own micro-environment, allowing for more of the same species to grow. They can then use quorum sensing in order to communicate with one another and begin their invasion. This is usually to the detriment of beneficial bacteria. When situations like this arise, pathogens like Salmonella and Campylobacter are common invasion species. So, what does changing the gut microflora have to do with food safety? If we can create a more diverse, balanced microbiota, this shifts the balance of species in the gut, reducing the risk of pathogen colonization. Recent genetic profiling work has highlighted a reduction in Campylobacter and Helicobacter genus groups, as well as the impact of microbiota modulation on Salmonella. It shows that the modulated microbiota significantly reduces the amount of Salmonella found in the caeca and the ovaries, which will directly reduce the chances of horizontal and vertical transmission. This is particularly important in the laying industry, especially with birds being taken past their vaccination protection frame. How to change gut microflora One means of controlling this is through the rehabilitation of the microflora after stress or challenge. This reverses any diversity losses and promotes immunity. Alltech recommends the use of Actigen® for normalizing microflora and promoting microbiome diversity. The gut is vital, not only for immunity but for general performance, as this is the site of nutrient digestion and absorption. The efficiency of this process will directly influence performance. As a result, Actigen: Increases weight gain. Improves feed efficiency. Improves livability. Recent research has looked at the impact of Actigen on the caecal microbiota, which directly influences the metabolome and increases the amount of short-chain fatty acids found in the caeca. A changing metabolome creates a better environment for beneficial bacteria to grow, which means that they can outcompete less favorable species. Eventually, this means that the microbiota changes in profile. Early life nutrition is key to influencing the mature microbiome through the impact on succession to climax colonies, although beginning rehabilitation at any age will have an impact. This impact will then start to influence the house microflora, which will then impact the next flock. Poultry meat and egg consumption is on the rise and is projected to continue growing at over 2%. This growth is a lifeline for farmers. With this increase, it is crucial that we do not allow there to also be an increase in foodborne illness or a food scare, like the Salmonella scare in the U.K. in the 1980s. Events such as these, even if not based solely on facts, can be detrimental to industries. Ensuring our food standards and safety will help us maintain customer trust and allow us to continue driving growth in sales. To do this, we must look within our flocks and focus on maintaining microbiota diversity.

But it does have the wheel rolling faster than it has rolled before. The facility produces two main products: Allzyme SSF and De-Odorase. It’s a state-of-the-art production facility with about 200 employees that produces several thousand tons of Allzyme SSF every year. It’s one of the largest facilities of its kind in the world. Alltech's solid state fermentation facility in Mexico, which produces Allzyme SSF, is one of the largest and most advanced facilities of its kind in the world. “Where Alltech rules the market is through the technology we’ve put into this,” said Kyle McKinney, an applications research scientist for Alltech. Unlike the more common submerged liquid fermentation (SmF), solid state fermentation (SSF) occurs when a filamentous fungi is grown on a solid culture. The process begins by growing the fungal organism in liquid fermentation tanks. It is then mixed with a sterile solid substrate to achieve a desired moisture level. The mixture is placed in trays that are moved to fermentation chambers. These chambers are large, highly-controlled environments that are monitored for temperature, humidity, air flow and other factors. The facility in Serdan has eight fermentation chambers, and each is about the size of a basketball court. Once the product is ready, it’s then dried and blended before being packaged and shipped for our customers. “Alltech Serdan has the ability to produce product with a broad spectrum of enzyme activities, liquid fermentation does not have this capability,” said Paul Kilgallen, Plant Manager for Alltech. “By using solid state fermentation we can produce the enzymes much more economically, which is very advantageous to us and the customer.” SSF isn’t new technology - the same process has been used in the making of soy sauce and saké for centuries, among other things. Alltech’s application of the process for the animal industry is what sets it apart. McKinney said the facility in Serdan is the most advanced of its kind in the world. The process is monitored closely to prevent contamination and maximize growth, resulting in a high-quality product trusted by farmers. “The fact that we could grow a fungal organism and produce enzymes in a controlled environment wasn’t anything new,” McKinney said. “It was about finding how to do it in a commercial environment.” SSF is more efficient than SmF at breaking down the nutrients in feed, which is what makes Allzyme SSF so valuable. It helps improve the digestibility of feed, improving feed efficiency and reducing waste. Farmers can save money on feed costs, traditionally one of their biggest expenses, by using less feed or by using alternative feeds. Reduced waste also means less impact on the environment. Alltech Serdan also produces a wide range of De-Odorase products. The De-Odorase facility is in the midst of an expansion that should double production capacity. The Serdan facility itself also puts an emphasis on sustainability and being environmentally friendly. It’s located in a dry region of Mexico about 120 miles southeast of Mexico City. The water that is used at the facility is reused and recycled. Kilgallen said there are also 60,000-70,000 yucca seedlings at the facility, used for replanting in the surrounding regions. About 15 years later, the plants are harvested and transported to Serdan where the yucca logs are used to produce De-Odorase products. Phase one of a new De-Odorase production facility was completed on site earlier this year, and it should be operational midway through 2014. The new facility could more than double production capacity. Alltech has had a presence in Serdan for 20 years, and the SSF facility has seen significant growth in that time. Kilgallen said they prefer to use local supplies and labor whenever possible, maintaining a strong place within a small community. Production now rolls around the clock as the facility continues to grow. “I believe in the not too distant future Alltech Serdan will have to increase its solid substrate fermentation capacity by building more culture chambers,” Kilgallen said. “The plant is getting close to its capacity and the demand for Allzyme SSF is ever increasing.” For more information on Allzyme SSF, click here.

Kentucky farmer Jim Wade believes you should look no further than the addition of cover crops to your farm operation. Cover crops can help with nutrient trapping, erosion prevention and weed reduction. Nutrient trapping and erosion prevention Wade plants three- and four-way mixes/combinations of various seeds with cereal rye. The use of a cover crop mixture that contains two or more species is often more effective than a planting of single species cover crop. Wade has experimented with cover crop combinations that include red clover, crimson, vetch and Austrian winter peas. His cover crops provide extremely good winter cover and help prevent soil erosion. The cereal rye has deep roots, Wade noted, making the soil more porous and increasing its water-holding capability. “My fields planted with cover crops don’t have brown runoff,” said Wade. “I measure for compaction and never find any.” Building soil health is very important. Over time, a cover crop regimen increases soil organic matter, leading to improvements in soil structure, stability and increased moisture and nutrient-holding capacity for plant growth. Cover crops also add organic, living matter to the soil with the degradation of their roots, explained Chuck McKenna, Alltech Crop Science territory sales manager. McKenna cited a research demonstration by the University of Kentucky in which one field plot has been no-tilled for more than 30 years. “There is nearly a difference of 10 inches in soil height between that and the rest of the area,” he noted, referring to the building of organic matter. No-till is almost a requirement when incorporating cover crops, added Wade. On his farm — where he raises corn, soybeans and wheat — he has been practicing no-till on 100 percent of his acres for more than 10 years. Weed reduction Another issue led Wade to experiment with cover crops: weed resistance. “The first thing I noticed after trying cover crops was that I no longer had a horseweed (marestail) problem,” said Wade. This year, he has a split test on corn acres. “The test looks to be very definitive,” he said, in favor of those with cover crops. With reduced weed pressure, Wade has been able to cut his herbicides cost in half. Additional return on investment Although today’s commodity prices are low, this is not the time to cut back on exploring cover crops, suggested McKenna. “Many farmers think they can’t afford to plant cover crops or think they don’t have the time to incorporate them into their operations,” he added. “If they put a pencil to it, they would see that they can’t afford not to!” Wade is one of many farmers participating in the Conservation Stewardship Program (CSP). He has enrolled 600 of his 1,000 acres in the cost-sharing program. In 2016, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service is making $150 million available for agricultural producers through the CSP. It is estimated this will help add 10 million acres to the USDA’s largest conservation program. With yield being the main way to increase profit, Wade happily reported that he believes he will see a 10 percent yield increase in his soybean fields this year. Local adaption As with any early adopter, Wade has had to adapt current technology to keep up with changing needs. With a background including training in engineering, he has modified his equipment to fit his cover crop strategy. Crimpers are a good idea, Wade suggested. He has also custom built a 60-foot planter for planting into cover crops. “It’s heavier than it used to be, and I use as much down pressure as I can get,” he said. To plant the cover crops, Wade has a Hagie highboy sprayer that has been modified for broadcast seeding. In conclusion, McKenna believes the addition of cover crops are a win-win for producers. “They fit into an overall plant and soil health scheme,” he said. “They can complement — not replace —conventional programs.” Have a question or comment?","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/incorporate-cover-crops-plant-and-soil-health","title":"\n\n                    Incorporate cover crops for plant and soil health\n                    ","date":"February 28, 2018","contentLength":686}},{"pageContent":"White eggs vs. Brown eggs Identical in nutrient value, the only real difference between the two is the breed of hen they come from. White shelled eggs are typically produced by hens with white feathers, while brown shelled eggs are typically from hens with brown feathers. Conventional Eggs laid by hens living in cages with access to feed, water, and security. The cages serve as nesting space and can enhance production efficiency. In this type of hen house, the birds are more readily protected from the elements, disease and natural and unnatural predators. Organic To produce eggs that can be labeled as ‘organic’, hens are fed rations with ingredients that were grown without most conventional pesticides, fungicides, herbicides or commercial fertilizers. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has specific rules to define organic production and prohibits the use of the term organic on packaging of any food product not produced in accordance with its rule. According to USDA, the organic label does not indicate that the product has safety, quality or nutritional attributes that are any higher than conventionally raised product. Vegetarian Diet Hens are fed a special feed containing ingredients of plant origin only. The nutrient content of these eggs is the same as that of conventional eggs. Omega-3-Enriched Many farmers believe specialty eggs, particularly omega-3 enriched eggs, will be the next big thing in the functional food market, but not all omega-3’s are created equal. There are three major omega-3 fatty acids with distinct health benefits: docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA). ALA is often promoted as omega-3 in foods, largely due to its low cost and abundant availability fed to layers as linseed. While this serves as an energy source, its relative inability to be converted to DHA means the animal and consumer receive minimal health benefits. EPA is a long-chain omega-3 that is important for cardiovascular function and inflammation reduction. EPA found in eggs is typically sourced from fish oil and fish meal fed to the hens. DHA is vital in human diets, playing an important role during pregnancy and early infant development. In children, DHA is linked to improved learning outcomes and behavior. In adults, DHA has been associated with lower rate of cardiovascular disease and improved cognitive health. DHA in eggs can be found alongside EPA sourced from fish products, but can also be supplied by algae that are naturally high in DHA. Omega-3-enriched eggs laid by hens fed an algae-enriched diet produce eggs that are suitable for an ovo-vegetarian diet. Vitamin- or Mineral-Enriched These eggs are from hens fed a nutritionally-enhanced diet with higher levels of certain nutrients (eg. selenium, vitamin E, folate, lutein, vitamin B-6, vitamin B-12). As a result, these eggs contain higher amounts of select nutrients. Free-Range Eggs produced by hens that have access to the outdoors in accordance with weather, environmental or state standards. In addition to consuming a diet of grains, these hens may forage for wild plants and insects and are sometimes called ‘pasture-fed’ hens. They are provided floor space, nesting space and perches. Cage-Free Eggs laid by hens at indoor floor operations, sometimes called ‘free-roaming’. The hens may walk freely in a building, room or open area, usually in a barn or poultry house, and have unlimited access to fresh food and water, while some may also forage for food if they are allowed outdoors. Cage-free systems vary and include barn-raised and free-range hens, both of which have shelter that helps protect against predators. Both types are produced under common handling and care practices, which provide floor space, nest space and perches. Natural Under USDA regulations, a “natural” product has no artificial ingredients, coloring ingredients, or chemical preservatives, and is minimally processed, just enough to get it ready to be cooked. No Hormones Added No artificial or added hormones are used in the production of any poultry in the United States. Regulations of the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) prohibit the use of such hormones. Therefore, any brand of eggs can be labeled “raised without hormones”, however, any package of eggs with that type of label must also have a statement that no hormones are used in the production of any poultry. “Raised without Antibiotics” or “Antibiotic-Free” “Raised without antibiotics” on a carton of eggs indicates that during the period while hens are laying eggs, there was no use of products classified as antibiotics for animal health maintenance, disease prevention or treatment of disease. Flocks producing certified organic eggs must be antibiotic-free by regulation. Flocks producing conventional eggs may use FDA-approved antibiotics and must comply with FDA levels of use and other restrictions. FDA regulations assure that antibiotic residues do not occur in the egg itself. Enriched Colony A production system that contains adequate environmental enrichments to provide perch space, dust bathing or a scratch area(s), and nest space to allow the layers to exhibit inherent behavior. Enriched colony systems are American Humane Certified.

This time of upheaval will determine who in the food industry will surge ahead and who will get left behind. According to Jessica Adelman, former Kroger executive and CEO of ESG Results, in 2015, for the first time in history, the consumption of food prepared outside the home was greater than the amount of food prepared at home. However, as a result of COVID-19, sector analysts are predicting a $100-billion shift back from restaurants and food service to the retail space. Between March 9 and March 22, 2020, the internet saw a 60% increase in cooking-related tweets, as well as 250,000 tweets about ordering and delivery. This represents a seismic shift — a 294% increase in talking about food from the previous month. Jessica has held numerous leadership positions in the food, retail and agriculture sectors, including most recently as group vice president of corporate affairs for The Kroger Co., serving as chief corporate affairs officer, chief communications officer, chief sustainability officer and president of both Kroger Foundations. She joined the Alltech ONE Virtual Experience to share her insights on the long-lasting habits of the new consumer emerging from the lockdown, including trends in food and retail as well as long-term patterns already beginning to take root. She said that now is the time for the agri-food sector to seize opportunities and write its own story. “The rhetorical question that I pose to you today is, ‘Who do you want to be during, and then as a result of, COVID-19?’” asked Jessica. “I encourage you to write your own headlines now. And I encourage you to think about who you want to be and how you want to lead your organizations so that, coming out of this chapter, the best headlines and lead paragraphs are written about your organization's conduct, resilience and courage during COVID-19.” Food and retail: The meteoric rise of e-commerce In many difficult situations, such as the current pandemic, retailers often find themselves on the frontlines of challenging discussions. Retail is currently in trouble, with estimates that 15,000 stores may stay closed permanently post-COVID. The food industry and grocery space is different, however, and is seeing a boom, according to Jessica. Nielson has reported that $18.8 billion was spent on consumer packaged goods (CPGs) in the month of March alone, which was directly attributed to COVID-related buying. Approximately $10 billion of that was spent on increased consumption, and $8.2 billion went directly toward pantry loading. “Interestingly,” said Jessica, “70% of Americans say they still want to be able to, and like to, venture out to the grocery store. So, all of this leads us to the insight that the food industry is one of the only sectors that is actively hiring and thriving during this pandemic.” The retailers who will struggle, she said, are the independents, leading to further consolidation and monopolies at both the regional and national levels of the retail food chain. The most striking trend in food and retail is the rise of e-commerce. Jessica shared Nielson data that shows that e-commerce orders saw a major surge in the month of March, with online orders increasing by 60%. Significantly, 37% of that growth came from new households, and 45% of new online shoppers were over the age of 55. As this “new normal” continues to evolve, Jessica believes retailers with good infrastructure are more likely to come out of the transition in a good place. “I think you're going to see the retailers who have the infrastructure, the ability to invest in their rail system — and ‘rails’ is kind of the e-commerce term for the infrastructure and platform that people use — who had their rails and the infrastructure in place already, those guys are going to do really well during the e-commerce boom, meet the customer expectations,” she said. “Maybe not in all cases, but they'll walk away with a decent customer experience, and they'll probably win that business for the long term. Those who had infrastructure and systems that were held together more by duct tape will just find themselves slowly losing ground and won't be competitive in the long run.” A combination approach, which Jessica referred to as “bricks and clicks,” could also develop, similar to what happened when e-commerce giant Amazon bought brick-and-mortar Whole Foods. Whether retailers are online or just around the street corner, the important thing will be building an emotional relationship with the customer base. “People don't really care about the infrastructure behind it,” explained Jessica. “We don't want to get too worried about what kind of rails or systems the retailers are using. We just want to know we can get the thing that we want, in the venue that we want, for a competitive price, when we want it.” A key challenge the food and retail sector must meet going forward is retraining and upskilling workers as the industry continues to become more efficient, which will involve more technology, automation and “touchless” environments. “Many of those manufacturing jobs and other positions might never come back to the 100% mark they were pre-COVID,” said Jessica. “That's what we're going to have to deal with as a society, is how do we retrain workers, and how do we make sure that we can have a productive workforce in this nation and other nations who are facing similar crises as a result of COVID. How do we upskill? And what is the future of work?” Consumers: Food as medicine will grow, and trust in science could see a resurgence University College London has conducted research that shows most new habits take an average of 66 days to form, which means that we are cementing new habits during the COVID-19 crisis, even while many of us remain in lockdown. Consumers, said Jessica, will likely begin to blend their new habits with their old routines. In fact, among consumers who have purchased alternative brands due to the effects of the pandemic, she said only half indicate that they will return to their previous brands once the pandemic calms. Both private-label and national brands are winning in different areas of the market. Private-label brands could be growing as much as four times faster than national brands at the moment. On the other hand, one sector analyst from Stifel mentioned in a recent Washington Post article that big-company sales grew 39% through the month of March, a number that has never been seen before in the industry. Food as medicine and the importance of health is a trend accelerated strongly by COVID-19. Functional foods are becoming more mainstream, and Jessica believes agriculture must take action in this space. “Certainly, as we are taking these drastic steps to preserve our health and safety right now, you can't help but imagine a world where we're all much more dialed into food, food safety and how to keep ourselves healthy for the long term,” she said. “And I think the food and ag position to take the leadership role and thought leadership in this space is absolutely a great moment in time. And we should step up and seize it.” Another critical development at this time could be a renewed sense of trust in science in the food space, which has traditionally been wary of science. Now, more than ever, we must listen to experts if we want to feed the world while also ensuring we protect it for future generations. “We might be at the tipping point where consumers will permit science to re-enter the discussion on agriculture, food and nutrition,” said Jessica. “It's been very interesting to watch how COVID-19 has led to a re-appreciation of scientists, science, doctors and, in general, the return of experts. And we might have a newfound appetite for letting experts do more to ensure food security versus just hope for the best, which means we might have a chance of feeding the 10 billion and better preserving our planet.” Traditionally, she explained, agriculture has answered questions of a more emotional nature with scientific responses, but food is a very emotional topic. “Society has been asking emotional questions for the past couple decades about science in food and technology in food,” said Jessica. “And we, as an industry, have done kind of a lousy job and only given them scientific answers back. Now, things that I love in this space are thought leaders — much like Alltech and your Planet of Plenty™ work; you are stepping into that void, hearing that people want to have emotional answers, but then answering in a scientific way with data and facts.” The future of food and retail Jessica identified six long-term patterns that will continue to evolve as the agri-food space emerges from COVID-19: Big data and the internet of things (IoT): People’s appreciation for harnessing information and gaining relevant insights is growing, and it will likely be used more moving forward. Society may therefore accept a tradeoff between data and privacy. A stronger digital infrastructure: In conjunction with big data, IT departments and people around the world have been under great stress to ensure that a large number of people can complete work virtually, and the digital infrastructure should emerge much stronger as a result. Tele-health, tele-education, tele-everything! Many things we thought could only be done in person can now be done online, and it could remain that way moving forward. From “frictionless” to “touchless”: The user experience of the future will involve as little interaction as possible with hard surfaces and human beings, especially as we continue to determine how to conduct business during the pandemic. Retailers must help people to feel safe during these in-person experiences. Widening income inequality: Unfortunately, there are likely to be deep political repercussions surrounding income inequality for years to come. Stakeholder capitalism and ESG: The way companies treat their workforce today will have huge ramifications in the future, with those that focus on the environmental, social and governance (ESG) aspects of their businesses coming out on top. The take-away, said Jessica, is that people will be more in tune with, and loyal to, brands that showed up well during the crisis with a strong focus on the ESG aspects of their business. “Companies that are bold and don't let a good crisis go to waste will emerge stronger,” she explained. “But they also have to make sure that they're taking care of their communities and their workforce at the same time, which is a difficult balancing act and a needle that they'll have to thread, but one where I think, if you take that holistic stakeholder capitalism approach and think about the long term, you'll be able to navigate successfully and emerge as one of the winners from this chapter of history.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/jessica-adelman-agri-food-now-time-write-your-own-headlines","title":"\n\n                    Jessica Adelman: In agri-food, now is the time to write your own headlines\n                    ","date":"May 21, 2020","contentLength":1864}},{"pageContent":"Norman neighed hello to the Dominican Republic and was excited to learn more about its history and culture. Norman recalled that during Christopher Columbus’ second voyage in 1493, Columbus returned to the Dominican Republic bringing oranges, limes, citron, olive and walnut trees, wheat, rice, cinnamon, cloves, peaches, apricots, sheep, goats, cattle, pigs and of course horses! Settlers used these horses in farming, gold mining and mercantile enterprises. Their descendents are today’s Paso Fino, a clever and planned mix of several Spanish breeds. It is the oldest native breed in the Western Hemisphere. Paso Fino translates as “fine step” in English. Its premier characteristics are a smooth and even gate and it’s known for its hardiness and natural presence. Norman noted how remarkably versatile the Paso Fino horse is. He was hoping to meet some Paso Fino horses on his journey but first he had to meet with Carolina Orizondo, a competitor in this year’s Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games™ 2014 in Normandy. Norman meets with an Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games™ 2014 in Normandy competitor Norman was delighted to hear that Carolina Orizondo discovered her passion for horses when she was only five years old. Carolina told Norman that she has spent her whole life surrounded by both the equestrian and farming world. Her father introduced reining as a discipline in the Dominican Republic, where he trained his daughters in the sport. One of Carolina’s sisters participated in the World Equestrian Games some years back and that encouraged her to compete this year. The national qualifying rounds were among 12 horse riders and Faunty Garrido and Carolina Orizondo were selected to compete at this year’s Games in Normandy. Before leaving, Carolina brought Norman to meet some Paso Fino horses in a nearby stable. Here Norman swapped tips on health and nutrition. The Paso Fino horses told Norman he must eat well and get plenty of rest during his journey around the world. As Norman left the Dominican Republic he already looked forward to catching up with Carolina at the Games and he thought of all the other competitors he would meet on his global trot.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/norman-learns-about-dominican-republics-horse-history","title":"\n\n                    Norman learns about the Dominican Republic's horse history!\n                    ","date":"August 21, 2014","contentLength":360}},{"pageContent":"The pre-weaning growth of a dairy calf is a powerful predictor of long-term productivity and profitability. However, diarrhea is one of the most common antagonists resulting in poor digestion and less than optimal weight gain in calves. A unique product derived from a selected strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been shown to enhance performance, including intake, growth and overall health, by improving gut health and digestive function. A recent meta-analysis conducted by Dr. Anna Catharina Berge of Berge Veterinary Consulting BVBA has put Alltech’s product, Bio-Mos®, to the test. Berge’s trials revealed that pre-weaned dairy calves fed Bio-Mos in milk or milk replacer had significantly improved average daily gain by an estimated 0.14 pounds per head per day, which corresponds to an 8.37-pound higher weight on average for calves weaned at two months of age. The long-term improved performance in heifers with enhanced pre-weaning growth would be equivalent to 220 pounds more milk in the first lactation! “The results are a significant improvement in average daily weight gain,” said Aidan Connolly, chief innovation officer and vice president of corporate accounts at Alltech. “This improvement leads to greater returns for the producer through enhanced milk production, health and development, and long-term productivity.” The meta-analysis included 23 cohort studies performed in the U.S.A., the United Kingdom, Brazil, Chile, the Czech Republic, India, Japan, Peru, Poland, Spain and Turkey between 1993 and 2012. Bio-Mos was supplemented from 2–10 grams per day, with an average inclusion of 3.8 grams per day. Twenty-one of the studies reported an increase in daily weight gain for calves fed Bio-Mos in milk or milk replacer compared to control calves. As new restrictions come into play on antibiotic use, producers across the globe are beginning to take a closer look at natural approaches to improve animal health and performance. Choosing an alternative that is backed by substantial research is a sure bet for a smart start on any dairy operation.

I hope you all had a very happy Chinese new year of the sheep. Yep, you heard me, I said SHEEP. There are a lot of articles on the internet about how confused everybody is about the Chinese zodiac signs, especially for this year. Is it the year of the sheep? Is it the goat? Or is it the ram? After a heated discussion with my friend who is working in archaeology, he told me the sheep was the first domesticated animal of that family in China. They discovered a 4,000 year old sheep fossil. And, most of the related sculptures and paintings from that time have the appearance of a sheep. So, sheep it is. Please check out the picture I took in Chinese National Museum in Beijing. It’s a vessel from Shang dynasty 1400~1100 BC. Does it look like sheep to you? It does to me. The traditional way of celebrating New Year in China is pretty complicated but you can summarize everything with one word, RED. Red lanterns, red fireworks, red clothes, red gift bags, basically everything is red. According to the old Chinese myths, the color red can scare off the evil monsters which like to come out and do bad things around New Year’s. This is already the 6th month of my Dairy Career Development Program and the 4th month since I arrived on the DFI farm. During the last 4 months here I have been blessed to work with so many dedicated and experienced people in the farm. One of the most important things I learned about working on a farm is that there is no day off. Weekend, Christmas, New Year’s, Chinese New Year et cetera. As long as there are cows inside, there’s no break. So I believe it’s more important to love the job one is doing than any other industry. Lucky for me I love what I am doing so when they said “Han, tomorrow (New Year) let’s clean the calf barn and put out some new bedding for them.” I said OK almost automatically. After hours of work in the winter wind, the calves can lay on the new clean dry comfy bed through the New Year holiday now.

I spent this week working in Romania alongside Dr. Catalin Necula learning about how he implements the Alltech system on farm. Catalin took me to visit three of the farms he works with over three days. Catalin studied veterinary medicine in college but now enjoys working in the nutrition sector of the agricultural industry so as you can imagine, this was a great opportunity for me to spend some time with a very knowledgeable man. The three farms we visited were all different in their own ways but all very impressive operations. I completed a farm audit, TMR evaluation and manure assessment on all farms as well as carrying out some urine pH and ketone tests. It was an intense week with plenty of travelling across Romania and long working days but it was all worth it. One of the farms that stood out to me most on my trip was a 300 cow herd consisting of pedigree Montbeliarde and Jersey cows. It was a well-run farm with very happy cows! After each farm visit Catalin would help me complete a farm report and optimise diets where necessary. What Size is the Average Dairy Herd in Romania? As I visited large dairy farms (200 cows plus) I could not believe it when I heard that the average herd size in Romania was 3 cows. However, while travelling through some of the villages I then realised why. Lots of Romanian people own 1 and 2 cows and keep them at the side of their house where they are fed and milked. It was interesting to see different ways of dairy farming in different parts of the country.

Growing up in such a community taught me that nothing comes for free, how to work hard and never give up (even if you are having a bad day). Caring for livestock taught me responsibility and compassion at a very young age. But, most importantly the farmers that I called my neighbours taught me passion and always encouraged me to pursue what I love. In my opinion, there is no job that can rival that of farming because of the amount of work farmers do and how much they love it. Farmers are the heart and soul of their communities and the amount that they contribute to society cannot be overlooked. My favorite farmer happens to be my boyfriend, a 10th generation egg, dairy and poultry farmer in Nova Scotia, Canada. We went to high school together but did not really know each other and then university took us down separate paths. Because farmers taught me to pursue my passion and they lit a fire in me to pursue a future in agriculture. I decided to write my political science honors thesis on an agricultural policy issue, and as an advocate for farmer’s rights in government I reached out to the community for input on my project. That’s how David and I started seeing each other.

After seeing the passion he has for his job and exploring the realm of farm politics I have decided to pursue a Master of Public Administration in order to work in agricultural policy. David did a four-year business degree with a major in finance and realized that he could not imagine a future away from his farm. He is currently 23 and working full time with his uncle and father on their farm – Cornwallis Farms. This farm is particularly fascinating as Deacon John Newcombe established it in 1761 and the same land that was farmed then is still farmed to this day. I might be biased, but David is my favorite farmer because his passion inspires me. The fact that he was so keen to help me because he cared about the fate of the industry showed that farmer’s are willing to fight for their spot in society. He views farming as a lifestyle, as it is much bigger than just a job to him. It is tradition, culture, pride and what he loves. Every Thursday morning while I am at school I wake up to pictures taken at 3AM of the cows in the parlor, or the calves being fed. David never complains either – he loves showing off his land and animals and educating anyone who cares to listen. I can only wish that someday I have a job that I enjoy as much as he does, especially at such a young age. He’s an advocate for his industry, he is an active member of the local farm safety board, he attends young farmers conferences, and he is a member of the local fire department among other things. Like the farmers I grew up with, he takes time and goes out of his way to help anyone. This is why, of all the farmers I know, David is my favorite.

Whether we do this through the clothes we wear, the cars we drive or the pastimes we pursue, we make a point of filling our lives with things that complement and accentuate our personalities. However, there are certain times in life that we favor the generic over the unique, especially when it comes to our health and well-being. From popular diets to prescription medicine, we are usually pointed in the direction of treatments that work best for the majority, with the assumption that they will work for us too. In reality, this is not always the case, as Dr. Matt Dawson, founder and CEO of Wild Health, explained during his presentation at the Alltech ONE Virtual Experience. “You are not a statistic, and medicine shouldn't treat you like you're a statistic,” Matt said. “We really should not be giving you medications or treatments based on epidemiology and population studies.” This ideology creates the foundational ethos of Wild Health, which endeavors to deliver personalized and precision medicine based on an individual’s genetic makeup and lifestyle. In order to formulate this bespoke medical care, there are certain fundamental aspects that Matt and his team look at. 1. DNA The idea for Wild Health came when Matt’s cofounder, Dr. Mike Mallin, learned that his cholesterol numbers were less than ideal. Matt found this shocking and worrisome, mainly because he could not understand why. “At the time, we were in our mid-30s, we were eating what we thought was a perfect diet, we were doing ultra-marathons, and this just didn’t make sense,” explained Matt. “We thought we were doing all the right things.” To combat the problem, Mike went down the typical treatment route. Matt advised a well-researched and supported diet, and his doctor prescribed him the same medication he would for any patient with high cholesterol. However, Mike’s situation got worse, so the pair started investigating other options. This was when they came to realize that, by looking at a patient’s DNA, it was possible to tailor personalized treatments. Looking at Mike’s genetics, they were able to pinpoint the exact strands of DNA that were inhibiting his recovery, and they altered his diet in order to work around those issues. From this initial success, they furthered their research, developed their process and finally established the business they run today. According to Matt, genomics can tell us a lot about what our body needs and wants. Beyond nutrition and diet, studying our DNA can show us what types of exercise we are most suited to and much more. This information is key to developing tailor-made and personalized treatments. 2. The overall picture While genomics plays a huge part in your overall health and is the first thing that Matt looks at when developing treatments, he admits that it is not the only factor taken into consideration. “Looking at your DNA is really important; it's like your human operating system,” explained Matt. “But it's not the whole picture. Health and wellness, and your longevity, is about 20% genetics, but most of it is actually epigenetics too.” This is because our lifestyle affects how our genetics operate, and if they do not support one another, we cannot achieve optimal health. Matt reckons that there are four foundational needs to be accounted for: Exercise Nutrition Sleep Stress and relationships This means that when creating the ideal treatment, Matt needs to look at the patient’s current state of well-being, too, through both medical tests and by simply having a conversation about their lifestyle. By doing this, he can see how a person is already addressing, or neglecting, the strengths and weaknesses in their genetic makeup. “As much as we like to talk about peptides and all these small molecules and other medications that can make a big difference,” admitted Matt, “they really dwarf in comparison to the basics.” For example, a person’s DNA may show that they require more than the average dose of vitamin D — but if they spend a lot of time outdoors, they could already be taking in the necessary amount. By combining these results with the genomic profile, Matt can begin to set a person on the right path to optimized health. 3. Personal preference The final consideration for the perfect, personalized health plan is the most subjective of them all: personal preference. After all, as Matt reasons, the perfect treatment is the one that appeals most to the patient. “That’s critically important,” stated Matt. “If we give you the perfect diet for you, but it’s not things you’re going to eat, then we’ve wasted our time.” By combining all of these factors, Wild Health is at the forefront of a new way of approaching medicine. Matt’s work shows and continues to build on the fact that by taking our individual quirks and traits into consideration, we can find medical care that not only optimizes our health but appeals to us too.

McDonald was the first panelist to speak at “The Next Normal for Agri-Food,” a keynote session moderated by Professor Damien McLoughlin, Anthony C. Cunningham Professor of Marketing at the University College Dublin (UCD) Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School. McLoughlin capitalized on the panel members’ expertise in different sectors, namely dairy, swine and poultry, to discuss the impacts of COVID-19 on global agribusiness and future implications. Joining the discussion were industry leaders Dr. Gordon Spronk, a vet by training and co-founder of the Pipestone System for pig production in the U.S., and Philip Wilkinson, a senior leader of several global poultry businesses and vice president of the Association of Poultry Processors and Poultry Trade in the EU (AVEC). The panelists each used one word to describe the state of their industry right now; McDonald said “chaos” when talking about the dairy industry, Spronk chose “unprecedented” for the pork industry and Wilkinson used “alarming” when citing the figures in the poultry industry. Key takeaways 1. There are similar challenges across agri-food industries due to COVID-19 regarding: - A change in foodservice demand and consumption habits: A significant volume of out-of-home consumption was lost. “When restaurants were closed, along with other foodservice entities, due to COVID-19 interventions, that decreased our demand,” said Spronk. According to him, restaurants and foodservice account for about 25% of the demand in the pork industry in the U.S. Wilkinson estimated that for the poultry industry in northern Europe, that number would be about 20%. McDonald shared that foodservice and restaurant sales are down 50% for dairy. Remarkably, however, during lockdown and panic-buying, dairy sales have gone up between 50–100%. “So, it’s a chaotic jump, in terms of the switch from restaurants and foodservice to retail,” she said. - The level of precision in the food supply chain: Restaurant shutdowns and plant closures due to government interventions created an issue of packaging in dairy, and an issue of weight in swine. In dairy, pack sizes and the types of dairy people are consuming are changing across the world. This leads to processors not being able to pack what is needed in time. In pig production, the fixed structure cannot handle a certain amount of weight or volume, which can become a safety issue. These issues have led to situations in the U.S. where milk is being dumped and pigs are being gassed or shot, while at the same time, there may be dairy and meat shortages in grocery stores. This has happened because the system cannot support the demand in terms of market access. Spronk called this an “odd situation,” while McDonald said this is “heartbreaking,” especially considering the food insecurity many people face. - Storage: Wilkinson mentioned that there are over half a million tons of chicken meat in freezers across Europe right now, and McDonald commented that the number is similar in dairy. She said that there will be about 500,000 tons of dairy going to storage by the end of May, which is comparable to what happened during the last economic shock. These products would typically have gone to foodservice and restaurants. “At some stage, when we come out of lockdown and get back the new norm, it's still going to take some time for that volume to filter out in the market,” asserted Wilkinson. “This is going to be an 18-month issue, not an 18-week issue. That’s 18 months of price pressure.” - Export: From a demand-and-supply point of view, McDonald suggested that three risks on the supply side are: 1. Farmers producing less: This can be the result of losing market access, losing credit to purchase feed, labor issues or immigration issues. 2. Governments losing their calm: Some governments are placing export bans on produce. 3. Stockpiling: This risk, when taken into consideration through the lens of exports, impacts traded calories around the world. Referring to the U.S. swine industry, Spronk explained that 30% of the product is exported. With this in mind, he raised a question: “Do we really want to depend on exports?” He argued that, while the world of globalization says we should, if there is geopolitics at play, that is something producers need to consider. Wilkinson claimed that, in Europe, there are some businesses and countries whose export policies have been to supply out-of-home consumption, and that is where the problem lies. 2. The moment of truth Each expert offered their view of what can be learned from what we are seeing during the time of COVID-19. Their insights were that: - A crisis highlights preexisting problems: “If there's any kind of fragility in the system, any kind of cracks or fissures that were already there previously, a crisis serves to highlight those,” said McDonald. “Many of the dairy systems are robust, functioning well and will continue to function well during this crisis and following.” - This is an opportunity to learn your strengths and weaknesses: “Mike Tyson once said, ‘Everybody's got a plan until you get punched in the mouth,’” said Spronk. “And so, I'd recommend to any leader in agriculture and in foodservice to lead carefully every day. Never waste a good crisis. Learn what really are the weak and strong points of your team, and build on that.” - It is harder to adapt when you are overly focused: “Those who are geared up purely to supply out-of-home companies aren’t able to capitalize on the upsurge in consumption from retail,” said Wilkinson. “So, if we find that this is going to be the new norm, countries that are producing high volumes of product are going to have to think again about where their market is or seriously consider looking at another way to utilize their agricultural land.” 3. Challenges present opportunities - The overall demand for dairy is growing: McDonald argued that, as more people move from subsistence poverty into the middle class in the coming years, one of the first things that they will spend more on is better-quality proteins, including dairy, chicken, pork and beef. - The poultry sector sees strong growth: “Every problem is an opportunity,” said Wilkinson. He affirmed that the poultry sector could respond quickly because of the short production cycle and because it is a massively consumed meat protein. “We’ve got a meat protein that is an amazing food converter,” he said. “We've got a meat protein that is amazing in terms of water consumption. It doesn't need a lot of space. You can turn it round in six, seven weeks. It is undoubtedly going to be up there in feeding 9–10 billion people going forward.” - Appetite for local food: In Australia, there is a massive push for local food that is welfare-friendly, traceable and safe. “Australia is starting to move out of lockdown, and out-of-home consumption is starting to pick up there,” said Wilkinson. McDonald also shared that throughout the Muslim world, dairy demand has increased because they are currently in Ramadan. This means that there is a lot more local milk going into informal milk supplies. - People are starting to return to plants and food services: Even though it will take time to reach full capacity, Spronk’s plants have all reopened. Restaurants that have been closed since the beginning of March are starting to open again as well. - More testing and the appropriate interventions: Drawing from his veterinarian background and training, Spronk pointed out that swine veterinarians deal with viruses all the time, and it is necessary to run tests. “(Tests) also need to be applied to the communities in general,” he said. “We need to understand who is immune, where’s the virus. Then you can impose the appropriate interventions and let life go on as we know it.” - A different way of organizing businesses: In China, nearly all production facilities have a dormitory on-site for the staff. Therefore, it is not unusual for staff to stay there for a period of time, which could last for weeks. “In this case, once COVID-19 was announced in China, we still have some farms where the staff has been there since January, before Chinese New Year,” said Spronk. 4. The future is bright for agri-food Although COVID-19 has exposed problems in the food supply chain, there is hope for the future. “Nothing's ever hopeless,” assured McDonald. “But it would take strong leadership and strong vision and commitment — commitment to really think about this in a long-term, systematically focused way.” This means that global collaboration is needed to solve a complex problem with a systematic approach. “If we just give food aid when these countries (in Africa) are going hungry, we risk disturbing the development of local agriculture,” said McDonald. “So, we're having a negative impact long-term. And we need to be very outcome-focused rather than consequentially focused.” From a poultry-sector perspective, Wilkinson believes the future is bright for chicken when we get through this, and the industry has got to be better and stronger as a result. “We will have no doubt whatsoever in feeding 10 billion people,” he said. “It's doable. And we can do it. There are going to be lots of opportunities to grow efficient businesses. There will be further consolidations of the industry. There will be fewer but bigger players. This is going to be an opportunistic time for the lean and the mean to get a bigger presence, particularly in the emerging markets.” On that note, McLoughlin thanked the panelists for their extraordinary global insights. “We went from the chaos and destruction of COVID-19 is wreaking in the food supply chain around the world to, I think, a very hopeful message that, in these three supply chains, there is resilience. There is strength,” he concluded. “Whether it's the structure of the European Union business, the character of the U.S. swine industry, the structure and resilience of the global poultry business, this too will pass. There are opportunities for those businesses which are led properly.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/next-normal-agri-food","title":"\n\n                    The next normal for agri-food\n                    ","date":"May 21, 2020","contentLength":1750}},{"pageContent":"Since man hunted and got a taste for the meat of the Auroch, later domesticated into the ancestors of modern cattle breeds, the market for beef has grown steadily. The last 10 years, however, have not been so kind, with plummeting beef consumption and higher prices. There is some light, as meat intense diets like paleo and keto have turned some consumers back to beef, but just at the moment when the cattle industry has become more consolidated, sophisticated and consumer-focused, it is ironically facing some of the greatest existential threats to its 10,000-year existence. There are three new primary threats to the beef industry: 1. Lab-grown meat Touted as sustainable and welfare-friendly or, conversely, dismissed as “fake meat,” the clear intent of growing meat in petri dishes is to displace the consumption of meat from beef cattle. Despite concerns about just how “friendly” the technology really is, meat producers — such as Cargill and Tyson — have invested in startups in this market. 2. Environmentalism Environmentalists advocating for ““Meatless Mondays’ and other initiatives at the consumer level have been unremitting in their attacks on the meat industry. These action groups have sometimes used dubious data to support their contention that cattle — specifically, beef — use more water and more resources and emit more greenhouse gases than other protein options. Their relentless attack appears to be having an effect on red meat consumption in the U.S. and Europe. 3. Other meats Chicken consumption continues to grow at 2 percent per year. Not only is it cheaply priced, neutral in flavor, easy to cook and unrestricted by religious constraints, it is also predicted to become the world’s favorite meat, taking the place of pork at number one. At the same time, fish has been positioned at the premium end of the market, touting human health benefits such as DHA and Omega-3. Both meats are stealing market share from beef. The resulting trend from this triple threat is clear: beef consumption has stagnated for the last ten years and, despite projections for growth in markets like China, new ways of thinking will be required. So how to respond? Can we manage the individual animal to maximize performance? Cattle are still one of the most efficient means of converting grasses and fiber into food. Can we learn to preserve natural resources and invest in sustainable decisions that boost soil health? How can technology help us better manage pastures and forage production better? What about the consumer? Can we improve the product — and, thereby, improve the experience — to create more consistent flavors, cooking and dining while also meeting their questions about welfare and the environment? More than most other protein-producing industries, beef production needs an injection of new ideas and technologies. Smart precision farming requires digital technologies to develop better management practices, accuracy and methods. Using an eight-technology framework can help us understand the opportunities for improvement that the industry must embrace in order to rise to this triple threat. 1. Sensors Through the use of sensors, cattle producers are capable of tracking virtually anything within their herd. They are expected to monitor an animal’s health and comfort, which can prove costly and time-consuming if done manually. With the implementation of wearable sensors, such as collar, ear or leg tags, ranchers are able to detect diseases and monitor everything more efficiently, from rumination to general animal health. For example, several companies offer calving sensors that notify the farmer when a cow is expected to give birth. Moocall’s calving sensor does this by monitoring tail movement patterns triggered by labor contractions. When the tail movement patterns reach a certain level of intensity, the Moocall sensor sends a text message to the farmer’s cell phone. JMB North America offers a sensor that alerts farmers when a cow’s water breaks. Other calving sensor options include the AfiAct 11 Leg Tag, Cow Call, and Vel’Phone. This technology can greatly improve calf survivability and allows farmers to be more effective in their time and energy efficiency. The University of Calgary is testing how accelerometers can be used to detect diseases within a beef cattle herd. The accelerometers are attached to the identification tags in the cow’s ears, because the movement in this area can show how much time is being spent eating, chewing cud, moving and resting. CowManager, a temperature sensor, also records movement related to eating, ruminating, walking and estrus activity. Similar sensors include TekVet, FeverTag Quantified Ag Allflex, and Precision Animal Solutions. These clips can measure changes in body temperature to help detect illness, reducing the chances of further infection to other cattle and significantly lowering costs while simultaneously increasing animal welfare. Craig Carter, the director of the University of Kentucky’s Veterinarian Diagnostic Lab, has performed research on an algorithm that can differentiate healthy from sick cattle and will generate alerts when specific animals need to be treated. Micro Technologies AmerisourceBergen has partnered with the Geissler Corporation to market, install and service the Whisper* Digital Stethoscope, the first tool developed to score severity of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in cattle. Vital Herd’s e-pill sensor is ingested by the cow and sits in the rumen, where it collects data on body temperature, heart rate, respiration rate, pH levels and other parameters. Another rumen bolus sensor, Moow, can measure CO2 and NH3 concentration, temperature levels and pH balances for up to three years, and all data is sent to local or cloud storage. Other rumen acidosis sensors include eBolus and VetAsyst. Heat detection in beef breeding can be crucial, and sensors like Heatime HR LD, Heatime Pro, Qwes HR-LD, RumiWatch, SenseTime Beef, and Cow Scout help to accurately identify the best insemination time. Each of these also watches changes in rumination patterns to try and catch potential health problems. Locating specific animals has been made easy with CowView and Smartbow. These neck and ear sensors localize every cow in real time to easily find which ones need to be checked, inseminated, treated or moved. The GrowSafe platform uses biometric sensors and data sources to continuously track and monitor sick and poorly performing animals. It also can measure an individual animal’s gain and current market value, which helps maximize profits. Vence, a virtual fence system, can eliminate the cost of traditional fencing and make it simple to rotate cattle and keep them within specific boundaries through the use of a neck collar. Animals learn to avoid certain areas by receiving low voltage shocks or uncomfortable sounds. ClicRTechnologies has also made strides in the beef industry by creating the ClicRweight system, which replaces the traditional gravity weighing system. This new scanning station system is placed where the animal would normally eat and can gather statistics quickly and accurately on each animal as it steps on to the scale without any human intervention, thereby reducing costs and allowing for better analysis. On the consumer side, food safety is of growing concern. When the quality and freshness of hamburger meat is in question, it is often tossed out, simply because people don’t want to take the risk. Safe Food Scientific has developed a biometric sensor that allows consumers to know if the beef in their fridges is safe to eat. Different forms of bacteria in beef reproduce in different conditions; access to nutrients, water and temperature can all affect how and the rate at which bacteria grow. Beef-Fresh Check tabs use biosensors to detect bacterial contaminants and help consumers determine if meat is safe to eat. 2. Drones These small aircraft are finding more uses in the cattle industry by allowing producers to easily manage feedlots and ranches. Farmers are using drones to check fence lines, spot holes or pockets that might need to be fixed and check water troughs and gates in remote locations through aerial images and video. Some models can run on their own after being flown through the route just one time, like the DJI Mavic Air, DJI Mavic Pro, and Phantom 4 Pro. After manually showing the drone where to fly, it will subsequently follow the same path for routine checks without extra assistance. When measuring pastures, the traditional strategies include use plate meters, pasture probes and tow-behind devices, but cameras on drones are becoming capable of performing the same task. Ranchers can also estimate the amounts of feed on-farm, particularly where there are areas of different growth. The wireless camera can assist with precision livestock by notifying a beef producer that a cow has calved or when locating a lost animal. Thermal cameras like the DJI Zenmuse XT can distinguish cows from other heat sources and spot animals underneath canopies or trees. Other popular drones used for scouting cattle include the Honeycomb Agdrone, DJI Matrice 100, DJI T600 Inspire 1, DJI Phantom 3 Advanced, eBee SQ drone and the Lancaster Hawkeye Mark 111. Looking ahead, drones may eventually become advanced enough to be able to spray pest deterrents directly onto herds, instead of farmers needing to manually spray by hand. From a teaching perspective, drones can be used to instruct veterinary students and ranchers how to move livestock using low-stress handling techniques. 3. Robots On a beef operation, robots can perform small, common tasks, such as daily feeding. Hanson Silo Company has partnered with Trioliet to manufacture just such a robotic feeding system. This self-automated robot will fill itself with feed and mix and deliver the food to animals in the barn. As long as the feed bins are kept full, the robot can run on its own and feed about 700 head of cattle up to 12 times a day. Additional feeding times are even better for the animal, since it ruminates better when eating more frequently. Other companies that produce automated feeding robots include Rovibec, KUHN System TKS, TKS Agri, Lucas G, Jeantil, Valmetal, Wasserbauer, Pellon, WIC System and Hetwin. The Swagbot is a robot that can move groups of cattle, tow heavy trailers and navigate around ditches, waterways and other rugged terrain. The University of Australia is trying to teach this robot to identify sick or ill animals by fitting it with temperature and motion sensors. One of the largest meat-packing plants in the world, JBS, has invested in Scott Technology, a New Zealand-based robotics firm. The meatpacking company is looking at ways to possibly incorporate automated machines as they attempt to turn a whole cow into certain cuts, like steaks and roasts. Even though these robots can use visual technology to cut into a carcass, a beef carcass requires the robot to feel instead of seeing — that is, it must be able to feel how deep a bone is to remove certain cuts of meat. This type of skilled cutting hasn’t been mastered by a robot yet, but investments are being made to meet this goal. 4. 3D Printing A new world of food processing is becoming a reality with 3D printing, and a lot of research is being done by Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA). This technology allows for the opportunity to use low-value meat cuts to create new types of food. According to MLA, at least one-third of each carcass ends up as hamburger trimmings for fast food chains. This new technology would give typically lower valued meats, such as offal, a new avenue for consumption, thereby creating a new opportunity to increase value for each carcass. This could potentially put more money in the pockets of farmers and ranchers. Where else are 3D printers making their way into consumer lives? Nursing homes! Because printed beef is easy to chew and swallow, Germany has incorporated 3D printers in 1,000 nursing homes and is considered more appetizing than the pureed food that was previously served. 5. Blockchain Now, more than ever, consumers are demanding complete transparency when it comes to purchasing meat products. Lack of knowledge about origin and concern over foodborne illness has left 75 percent of consumers distrustful of food labels, according to a study by Label Insights. Blockchain could be used to restore consumer confidence through its ability to trace products along the entire supply chain, from the producer to feedlot, feedlot to processor, processor to wholesaler and wholesaler to retailer. Grass Roots Farmers’ Cooperative were the first suppliers in the U.S. to use this technology. Their products now contain a QR code that can be scanned to see a “digital history” of where the beef came from and how the animals were raised. This information includes stories from the farmer and butcher who contributed to the final product now in stores. In China, InterAgri uses blockchain to allow consumers to trace the cow’s breed, when it was slaughtered and what bacteria testing it went through. Wyoming beef producers have combined efforts to create BeefChain, which allows consumers to have pasture-to-table traceability. Each animal receives an RFID tag that is linked via blockchain, and the assigned number follows the animal throughout the production process. Consumers can help shape this service online by submitting areas of interest or specific questions they have about the process. The organization promises to send information and to adapt its service to meet future interest. 6. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Livestock producers are now faced with the challenge of growing animals to conditions that match market and consumer specifications and timing. Even ranchers who have been working with cattle for generations can struggle to predict an animal’s yield potential prior to sale. However, AI technologies can be used to accurately predict an individual animal’s potential, as well as fat content, at any point in time by using cameras to analyze the herd. Researchers at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) have developed this technology by using off-the-shelf cameras on purebred Angus cattle farms. These cameras operate at 30 frames per second and can capture contours that reflect fat and muscle depth and size. That information is then converted to 3D images that are processed through artificial intelligence algorithms to provide an accurate condition score for each animal. Different shapes, such as muscling, are given a mathematical description and assigned a value, which can then be used to estimate a cow’s condition based on the 3D shape the machine “sees.” This type of technology allows farmers to see, at any given point, where each individual animal is in terms of maturity and can select animals with superior measured traits for breeding the next generation. When a rancher can make decisions based on high-quality, real-time information in low-stress environments, they will see better quality beef product — and results that match consumer preferences. Cainthus has developed algorithms for facial recognition of dairy cows to monitor the cow’s activity. This technology is also being developed for beef cattle, to replace of tracking devices, and this software may eliminate the need for wearables altogether, particularly for animals raised indoors. Using cameras stationed throughout the feedlot, the software alerts farmers when their cows show early signs of lameness. Cainthus’ goal is to have “machine vision,” allowing AI to supplant many sensor systems. Not only are ranchers trying to meet market specifications, they are also are constantly trying to manage their large herds effectively. Cattle Watch has developed a remote monitoring system by using AI, deep learning and mass data algorithms to monitor large cattle herds on a wide spectrum. This system can prevent animal theft through GPS satellite tracking and can use geofencing to stop animals from straying outside of the designated lot. It also has an automated animal-counting technology that can count large herds of cattle in a short amount of time and can also monitor the health of each individual cow. 7. Augmented Reality (AR) The cattle industry is now attempting to mix the real world with the virtual world by using only a pair of glasses or a cell phone. AR displays a virtual image on top of what can be see naturally through the viewer (i.e. reality) in real time, allowing new insights to come to light. Farm VR has created a farming technology that projects images of 3D objects from architectural drawings. If ranchers are interested in buying cattle lots, they can use VR to project renderings of their future lot on top of the lot as it currently looks, allowing them to see what their new lot would look like before actually building it. University classrooms are even using projected images to teach bovine anatomy. For instance, Harper Adams allows users to take a full look at an intact cow — including its skeleton, blood flow and the udder, in detail — by looking through the Bovine HoloLens. Students are then able to perform dissections of the udder, since they now know what to expect and can similarly walk their classmates through the process to help them learn the same procedure. 8. Virtual Reality (VR) Virtual reality is fairly similar to augmented reality because it also is a 3D, computer-generated environment. When using a VR headset, these environments move as you move, and the images appear life-size to each individual. Saskatchewan Cattlemen’s Association is using virtual reality technology to demonstrate life on a farm to the public. People don’t have to physically be on the farm to hear and see from a producer how they take care of their animals and what the animals’ life cycles are, giving producers a new way to engage and educate their consumers. Not only does this address common misconceptions, it also allows consumers to directly relate to the farmer. LiveCorp also offers a similar opportunity for consumers to experience the transportation side of an animal’s life, as their technology takes the user visually from a quarantine facility to a loading vessel. These efforts have all been made with the intent of improving consumers’ understanding of how the production process works. Pre-sale auction inspection is also set to enter the virtual reality realm, with Elders preparing to become one of the first livestock agencies to offer 360-degree selling to customers. (Check out the video.) Partnering with Tim Gentle has allowed Elders to record 360-degree picture and video experiences so that potential buyers can view animals at all possible angles. Viewers can move the environment in any direction desired when looking through the VR headset. Buyers can project auctions from any desktop or phone through the headset and view auctions in their own living room. The Internet of Things (IOT) All eight of these technologies have the capability to work together through the Internet of Things (IOT) — or “internet of cows,” as it has been called in this case. It is IOT that connects sensors, drones, robots and the like to computers and iPhones for data analysis and interpretation. Sensors — such as MOOnitor, a cattle monitoring system that measures and collects daily activity as well as estrus cycles — uses IOT to transfer data and keep real-time information at the fingertips of the farmer or rancher. Because the health of a beef cow directly affects the number of weaned calves each season, a technology such as this, with the ability to detect both sickness and estrus in cows, can improve calf yields, an important metric for beef producers. MOOnitor suggests that it can potentially increase a herd’s calving rate by 30 percent. A similar IOT system, BovControl, uses a cow’s information — including its birth date, medication, vaccinations and weight — to determine when it is ready to be sold. Farmers can also track an animal’s temperature or location through an ear tag or smart collar. AgriWebb is an app that can be used on your phone or tablet to track and keep up with all farm records, whether you are walking around your farm or are further from home. At any given time, a farmer has access to feed inventory, financial reports, grazing movements, task management options, individual animal data and biosecurity plans, allowing for better compliance with external certification and monitoring organizations. KEENAN InTouch provides the farmer with constant herd performance advice and information by way of data collection and analysis. Through this system, a team of nutritionists is available to assist farmers with herd health management, ration formulation, weight gains/yield and costs, with the goal of helping improve cash flow. This technology allows producers to monitor and control all feed usage and waste, which helps control costs and feed budgets and can speed up finishing times for cattle. The nutrigenomics piece The last piece of the puzzle is nutrigenomics, the study of nutrition in the genome. It has been determined that, just like for humans, what a cow eats directly affects its microbiome and, therefore, its growth and productivity. Previously, it was believed that cattle should be fed minerals and supplements freely. But, at Alltech, we have seen that supplementing animals with specific levels of nutrients at specific times encourages the body to use those nutrients more efficiently. Those nutrients should come in the form of organic trace minerals and not just any mineral or supplement combination. A targeted nutritional approach such as EPNIX® should be implemented to truly get the most out of production cattle. The cost/benefit conundrum These technologies can allow producers to maximize their management practices, increase productivity and efficiency and remain competitive. Interestingly, these benefits will also act as answers to prosumer concerns about such issues as animal welfare, environmental footprint and consistency of the final product. Can beef farming become “smart”? By measuring feed and water intake in real time and comparing it with the productivity of the animal, we can gain new insights. We can only manage what we can measure, and as such, beef producers should embrace technology to take advantage of genomic advances and use data to access the potential that is unlocked with a better understanding of the animal genome. Big data says a lot, but individual data tells a whole other story. Producers evaluating these eight technologies may struggle to identify which ones to use and how to invest for greatest return. Clearly, the prices for all of these vary, as will the benefits based on the particulars of a beef operation. Generally, in beef, sensors are the most likely to offer clear and immediate cost benefits. Machine vision is the most exciting technology and promises a lot. Blockchain might eventually do this as well, but the technology is still being rolled out; augmented and virtual reality aren’t there yet either. The cost-benefits that producers need to evaluate are the fixed cost investment (what equipment is required) and, then, the variable cost (what ongoing costs are required to run the system). I always recommend that producers or farmers evaluate technology by scrutinizing one feature or benefit of particular value to their production and, subsequently, making their purchasing decision based on that one criteria. Traditionally, we look for a 3:1 return, but the transformative nature of these technologies might allow purchasing even at lower initial returns. On a final note, if you ask ag-tech companies what question they fear most, they’ll tell you it is, “Please give me the name and phone number of a successful customer using your technology.” Tremendous technology is emerging within the beef industry, but some tech is further along the “tried-and-tested” path than others.

How is it grown? Is it sustainable? Is it environmentally friendly? This shift in consumer preference is changing the way that corporations work, because now, sustainability must become a permanent line item in their business plans. Not only is sustainably produced food becoming a non-negotiable for consumers and businesses, it also happens to be a solution to feeding the world. At the Alltech ONE Virtual Experience, Ciarán Black, owner of Nuevo Growth, hosted a discussion with Ryan Rakestraw, director at Temasek International, and Claudia Roessler, director of agriculture for Microsoft, to further discuss how to sustainably produce more food. The consensus? Via sustainable agriculture technologies. There are many forms of ag-tech — from technologies that help with the efficiency of how food is produced to technologies that create sustainable packaging and even technologies that can reduce food waste. “Now, ag-tech is making substantial progress. It’s one of the fastest growing areas, but it still remains one of the most under-invested subsectors in the global startup ecosystem,” said Black. So, if ag-tech is a solution, what needs to be done to hasten its road to success? Black proposed three methods: Encouraging investments in ag-tech Identifying sustainable agriculture technologies Stressing the urgency around a sustainable food supply Investments: How can we make sustainable ag-tech more attractive to investors? As awareness of sustainability grows, investors are taking notice. Rakestraw says there is a strong drive for sustainability today amongst most groups, including: Consumers. Consumers want to know the environmental impact of their purchases, and this influences a majority of their buying decisions. Businesses. Businesses are appointing directors with a sustainability agenda because consumers will continue to demand it. Farmers. In fact, Rakestraw says that most farmers are already environmental stewards. “They’re looking after their land, they’re thinking about passing the farm on to the next generation, so this is something that they’re certainly thinking about and interested in,” he said. “I just don’t think they’ve had a good way to act on this.” Because sustainability is, historically, an interest of farmers, is currently an interest of consumers and is now an interest of businesses, investors are primarily focused on companies that have implemented sustainability methods. “The question is, if you don’t have some type of sustainability agenda or the ability to influence sustainability in your product or service, will you even continue to exist?” asked Rakestraw. So, how can we ensure that we will continue to drive this sustainability agenda — especially when farmers, according to Roessler, are notoriously “late bloomers” when it comes to digital trends and advancements? There are many sustainable deliverables farmers need to achieve, including: Growing more while using fewer resources Tracking and measuring their sustainable footprint Telling consumers how their food was produced and where it’s coming from Farmers need digital and data-related innovations on their farms in order to meet these deliverables, and luckily, as Roessler noted, “the amounts that are being invested in the ag-tech industry are increasing over the last couple of years.” Investments are imperative for startups, universities and research organizations that have the goal of developing sustainable, environmental and agricultural practices. “This is from anything like detecting pest stress or disease stress on a farm in a certain region to smart irrigation in another region,” said Roessler. “So, we want to help harness this ecosystem.” It’s about more than just investing, though, and Roessler uses Microsoft’s startup programs as an example: They not only help invest but also help adjust the footprint, monitor sustainability goals, develop the process, market the products and deliver them to the buyer. Investors need to nurture startups to stimulate success. With this nurturing comes the speed that is necessary to “drive innovation at the speed that’s needed to address all those environmental changes.” Identification: Where are the applications that can help agriculture create a Planet of Plenty? Now that sustainability is on investors’ radars, it comes down to identifying sustainable ag-tech startups. Which startups should we be looking into? According to Roessler, we need to be looking at technology that increases productivity by growing more food that uses: Less energy Less land Less water This is especially important because productivity has one of the biggest impacts on the environment. “Think about if you could use 1.5 billion (fewer) acres of land in agriculture,” said Roessler. “This would be a significant purpose to what’s in our environmental goals.” Another area to identify is risk prevention. Ag-tech that can monitor farms and the environment prevents incidents that lead to: Food safety issues Food waste Disease Abnormalities Overall, Roessler stresses that it’s critical to address these issues before they arise, which will ultimately improve our whole food production process. “I think that’s really the ultimate goal, which we need to enable now,” stressed Roessler. Black then expanded on these points by reiterating the importance of identifying ag-tech that mitigates risk and creates a link to help the consumer understand sustainability within the supply chain. But it doesn’t just stop at risk detection; Rakestraw listed several additional technologies that warrant investments, including: Gene editing and precision breeding systems for crops and livestock Insights around the microbiome and the use of synthetic biology tools Sustainable packaging of food products, using less packaging or biodegradable materials while still maintaining the safety and shelf life of the product Rakestraw specifically highlighted the importance of ag-tech that reduces food waste, “whether that’s new coating technologies, optimized logistics or predictive analytics associated with matching supply and demand.” Urgency: Will we embrace ag-tech quickly enough? The growing population and increased environmental education add a sense of urgency to identifying sustainable ag-tech to invest in. “So, we know that agriculture is becoming more sustainable, but just not fast enough,” said Black. “Is there anything we can do to increase the pace of that change? How do we go about doing that?” Rakestraw listed three possible solutions: Industry collaboration — and not just within animal health and nutrition, but across industry segments. Through this collaboration, we will be able to educate consumers through quantifying and showcasing benefits. Public and private partnerships with government and industry to define standards, quantify metrics and regulate the messaging to convey to the consumer. Be bold and take some risks with moonshot goals associated with sustainability. “I think the onus is on not only us as investors but (as an) industry to find these technologies that could have a significant impact and support them and help them come to life in this 10-year, 20-year, 30-year time period,” explained Rakestraw. Digital technologies can increase the collaboration between startups, corporations and government. Will fast-paced industry collaborations lead us into a more sustainable future? Roessler says yes, but not by itself. We need to build programs that are sustainable for many years — not just short-term initiatives. The societal impact of agriculture requires creating infrastructures like internet connectivity for rural farms and fostering talent in agriculture that can work with technology in the future. While speed is important, Roessler says that longevity is also key. We need innovations quickly, but we also need to look at how technology evolves and stays current. “This is really (something) we’re in for the long run, and I think that’s really what’s needed to drive a systemic change in the industry,” said Roessler. Final thoughts By attracting investors, identifying technologies and urging quick action, we can anticipate a strong push in sustainable ag-tech for our futures. With the population growing rapidly, the industry has a collective duty to ensure food for the masses, and nurturing farms through new technologies can make this happen. Because, as Black stated at the beginning of his discussion, “Agriculture has the potential to provide solutions, both to feeding the planet and combating climate change — but we must do both.” Visit one.alltech.com for more information.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/how-ag-tech-can-improve-sustainable-agriculture","title":"\n\n                    How ag-tech can improve sustainable agriculture\n                    ","date":"August 13, 2020","contentLength":1353}},{"pageContent":"Alltech’s 37+™ mycotoxin analysis program has run more than 5,200 tests, each searching for over 37 mycotoxins in animal feed. In many cases, these mycotoxins can individually harm the animal when consumed, but many tests showed a combination of these toxins, which can cause harm to not only the animals but the overall performance and profitability of the farm. Of the thousands of tests run, 99.68 percent of samples contained at least one mycotoxin. You could say that mycotoxins are a consistent opponent. On average, every feed sample contained 7.3 mycotoxins. Mycotoxins have been shown to reduce feed intake, damage gut integrity and cause poor fertility.

Both the positive benefits and the negative stressors created by the environment not only affect plant growth and the actual yield attained at harvest — they also play a critical role in whether a plant will be able to reach its full genetic potential. What are the stressors? Rain, cold, heat and even the wind — the same meteorological factors that assist in crop growth — can also become great villains when they occur in excess, causing damage and destruction. Environmental stress can reduce plant productivity and overall crop production, resulting in economic instability for the farmer. Biotechnology is one weapon of choice when combating the adverse impacts caused by meteorological factors. Flooding can lead to soil erosion, a decrease in oxygen supply and an increase in disease risk. Developmental challenges also mean lower crop yields and higher weed competition pressure. Drought can result in stunted plants and limited root growth. Crop yields can decrease, and growers are more likely to cut their total planted acreage in order to limit their probable losses. Extreme weather, such as hail and high winds, can not only damage leaves, flowers and fruit but can break or detach them altogether, significantly impacting productivity. Freezing temperatures and frost can damage plants via the ice crystals that form. These crystals can cut plant cells, damage and kill flowers during the flowering period and even kill the entire plant. What happens when plants are stressed? Winter rains and snow ensure adequate soil moisture in preparation for the following season. However, as changes in climate affect agricultural cycles and conditions, farmers frequently face cold soils at planting, which result in plants taking more time and energy to establish themselves. “Injuries caused by these stress factors can result in delayed establishment and development, or even the complete loss of hectares of crop,” explained Nicolas Body, Alltech Crop Science European technical manager. “Improving the soil microbiology and enhancing a well-structured root system creates the circumstances to help plants better resist and overcome these stressful situations.” Reactions to stress can range from slightly burned leaves to the death of plant tissue, both below- and above-ground. “This causes the plant to suffer a long period of environmental stress and to reduce the initial grubbing up, impacting its size and productive potential,” Body continued. At these stages, the leaves are small and fragile, and the plant expends a lot of energy to recover from environmental damage. How to combat environmental stressors It is important to keep the soil and plants nourished, even before the seeds are planted. Providing balanced nutrition beginning at the very early stages of the plant’s life and throughout the entire crop cycle can help prepare the plant to face any environmental stressors. Before planting, growers should look at soil tests to identify any areas that need help so as to improve the soil’s microbial activity and nutrient availability. By improving the soil’s organic matter, there could also be an increase in the soil’s ability to hold and drain moisture, depending on need. Nutrients become more available to roots, and the improved nature of the soil allows those roots to grow further and spread out more, creating a stronger base for the plants and boosting their ability to reduce plant stress throughout the seasons. After planting, ensuring that plants are able to find and use important nutrients at the necessary levels is integral to decreasing the effect that environmental stressors can have on the plants. A fortified plant is better able to withstand stronger winds and can bounce back from hail damage more effectively. Biostimulant technologies can be used to promote the plant’s root growth and its development and productivity. How do biostimulants help plants? Biostimulants can act on plant physiology as signalling molecules to improve the plant’s ability to resist stress and improve its response to those stressors. Noticeable improvements can be seen in plant processes such as: Growth The establishment, setting and bulking of fruit or grain The ability to face some of the biggest agricultural challenges — abiotic stresses like drought and salinity The Alltech Crop Science (ACS) range of soil and performance solutions uses biotechnology to promote increased root growth, balanced nutrition and improved performance in plants. Nutritionally balanced and complexed with high-quality amino acids, Alltech Crop Science solutions allow for more rapid absorption and the improved movement of nutrients throughout the plant to where they are most needed, promoting increased quality and productivity. As an agronomic segment, cereals and grains are expected to become the largest market share for the use of biologicals, due to higher demands for environmentally friendly fertilizers and bans on chemicals used as inputs in agriculture. “It's a new frontier,” said Body. “Biologicals could contribute to the ability to stimulate the plant's own capacity for biochemical responses against stress factors.” Body also pointed out two additional key benefits from the increased use of this technology. “A greater global use of biologicals could help in improving chemically treated lands and water sources,” he said. “Their use can reduce the use of pesticides and will improve the efficient use of nutrients such as nitrogen.” Growers are choosing more natural ways to manage their productions in an effort to be more sustainable. They are naturally strengthening their plants and making them less susceptible to the damages that can be incurred by the environmental stressors that vary from year to year. Increased soil and plant health — as well as the consequent increased productivity — make these naturally based technologies and investments well worth it.

Each element of ACE would need to be kept in mind and in balance with one another. “Dr. Lyons decided from the beginning that it was not going to be a chemical or antibiotic-based approach to food-animal nutrition,” said Dr. Kate Jacques, Alltech's director of nutrition, recalling what persuaded her to join the company more than 30 years ago. “They were going to dump money into research to find new ways around it. Thirty years ago, that was a very radical idea.” Part one of this four-part series on the Alltech ACE principle focuses on the “E” portion of ACE and how the needs of the agriculture industry can be addressed while reducing farming’s impact on the environment. It began with yeast “The ability to use live yeast in beef and dairy cattle diets to improve efficiency is probably the number one driving force that got the company started,” recalled Dr. Karl Dawson, vice president and chief scientific officer at Alltech, another early recruit. “The next thing that came out of that was the realization that we could take yeast apart and produce derivatives that led to a series of materials that improve animal performance and growth,” he continued. “They’re not antibiotics; they’re not chemicals; they are a natural material that promotes growth, improving efficiency and impacting the way livestock are influencing the environment.” Walk the talk The belief that the company itself should embody an ethos of sustainability has inspired the development of company-wide environmental criteria. “The Alltech Environmental Management System is structured to the requirements of ISO 14001, the international standard for environmental management,” said Mark Jones, health, safety and environment systems manager in the Alltech office in Stamford, England. “The requirements of ISO 14001 talk about your environmental policy, your objectives and targets, and communication. But, mainly, it talks about your commitment and leadership across the business.” Alltech’s European headquarters in Dunboyne, Ireland, is working on achieving ISO 14001 certification. At Alltech’s European headquarters in Dunboyne, Ireland, Jones is working with a sustainability committee through the process of achieving ISO 14001 certification. The Dunboyne office began pursuing this cerfication as it was becoming more common for other companies or customers to inquire if they were ISO 14001-certified when choosing to work with them. They believe that having this quality standard in place will demonstrate their commitment to improving environmental performance. The National Standards Authority of Ireland recently granted this prestigious status to the Alltech-owned KEENAN, the Ireland-based manufacturer of advanced diet feeders and software products. The company is focusing on four areas that it wants to bring under control, including transport, procurement, air emissions and waste management. KEENAN has been awarded ISO 14001 certification. Corralling carbon Another important certification has come from Europe’s Carbon Trust for Alltech E-CO2, an agri-environmental farm efficiency software and consultancy company specializing in farm-level environmental carbon and water assessments. While the degree of agricultural contribution to greenhouse gases remains in debate, Alltech E-CO2 is working with farmers to help them know exactly where their operations fit into the emissions picture. The company provides comprehensive carbon audits and calculates total farm carbon footprint. “If you want to look at a carbon footprint, you need to have an accurate estimate of what’s going to happen when you feed alfalfa hay or grain to the animal,” said Dawson. “This allows you to do that.” Alltech E-CO2 recently surveyed 58 dairy farms in Europe to gather carbon footprint information. The audit identified areas for improvement in milk production, animal health and reproduction. As a result, the farms made recommended changes in management and nutritional programs. Six months later, Alltech E-CO2 revisited the farms for follow-up evaluations. Greenhouse gas emissions had been reduced by 2.8 pounds per cow per day. In addition, the audit found the farms were averaging a 2-pound increase in milk, with reduced incidence of mastitis, metritis and lameness. Between increased milk yield and improved fertility and health, farm profits were estimated to have increased by $253 per cow per year. Alltech E-CO2 clients are provided with an interactive tool that lets them determine on their own the amount of greenhouse gas emissions being produced by their operations. “The What If tool offers a quick point in time,” said Andrew Wynne, general business manager at Alltech E-CO2. “You have a conversation with a farmer, and within five minutes, they have information on where they have the best chances of making improvements. It’s really quite visual and quick.” The tool is also available in versions designed for beef and lamb producers. Just eat the whole thing Even the matter of how feed supplements are provided to cattle hasn’t escaped environmental consideration. The Alltech-owned Ridley Block Operations manufactures the BioBarrel®, an edible feed supplement container that is literally eaten along with the supplements. Think of it as an ice cream cone for cows. The BioBarrel is made from 100 percent renewable materials and is designed to degrade as livestock consume the low-moisture block it contains. The low-moisture block supplement is manufactured by heating up molasses and then cooling it into a very hard block that can only be licked, providing additional protein, vitamins and minerals to grazing herds. Low-moisture blocks feed the rumen’s microbes, giving the microbes the ability to break down mature/dry forage efficiently and convert it into energy. The product is also beneficial to the producer. Additionally, the BioBarrel can have a significant impact on land management and conservation. The barrels can be strategically placed to attract cattle to areas that were previously unused, giving them an incentive to remain there long enough that a good share of the forage is utilized. A solution to increasing regulations on mineral pollution Livestock in many parts of the world have been overfed inorganic forms of trace minerals, such as copper, manganese and zinc, to offset their inefficient digestibility. As a result, the excess ends up in manure. “Many countries around the world have already passed legislation restricting the use of trace minerals because this overfortification has led to pollution,” noted Steve Elliott, global director of the mineral management team at Alltech. “Some of the levels of trace minerals, particularly zinc and copper, have gotten so high that it’s actually above the legal limit to spread out into fields for use of growth of forages and/or grain, and now we’re stuck with it,” he continued. “It’s many, many tons of excretion that are above the legal limit to actually spread for fertilizer. That’s becoming a big issue all around the world.” Alltech is a leading producer of organic trace minerals for livestock. These organic minerals can be fed in much lower levels than inorganic minerals because they are more efficiently and thoroughly digested by the animal. The company’s Total Replacement Technology™ (TRT) is helping producers comply with increasing anti-pollution regulations by offering a way to feed fewer minerals to their livestock and get optimal performance results. “We’re talking about 75 percent less of these environmental contaminants being produced by a cow or a pig,” said Dawson. “That is a tremendous impact. And, in places like the Netherlands, where they have a cap on the levels of copper and zinc that can spread on the soil, it allows you to grow about three times as many animals on the same amount of feed and land.” TRT has been used in most production species: swine, poultry, cattle, as well as in many different phases of poultry production, whether egg-producing layer birds, broilers or breeders. This same concern about how trace minerals impact the environment is shared in Alltech’s crop science division. “We are extremely concerned with sustainability,” said Dr. Steven Borst, general manager of Alltech Crop Science. “The minerals that we incorporate into the plant nutrient side of the business meet the same quality standards that we adhere to on the Alltech feed and animal side. “No one cares more about land and the environment than a farmer,” he continued. “They understand what’s occurring from a biological perspective. Their cropland is like another child to them. They want to produce as much as they possibly can without compromising their soil for the future.\" Supporting China’s ag revolution China is turning its attention to the impact of livestock production on the environment, and on soil in particular. One-fifth of Chinese soil is fallow, “a consequence of exposure to heavy metal contaminants,” according to a bulletin issued by China’s Ministries of Environmental Protection and Land and Resources. In recent years, hundreds of thousands of small farms across China have been forced out of operation as Beijing has carried out a campaign to clean up the world's biggest livestock sector, according to Reuters. Alltech is engaged in a survey project in China to investigate pollution levels of minerals and heavy metals in animal manure. Current levels of copper, iron, manganese and zinc are very high. But the application of Alltech’s Bioplex® trace minerals has not only significantly reduced mineral release in manure — it has also decreased levels of heavy metals such as chromium, according to Alltech researchers. And in March of 2017, the company signed a memorandum of cooperation with the Soil and Fertilizer Alliance of China (SFAC) to improve soil quality and protect the environment from further degradation. Dr. Mark Lyons, Alltech’s global vice president and head of Greater China, is vice president of the Soil and Fertilizer Alliance of China (SFAC), which aims to improve soil quality and protect the environment from further degradation. Under the agreement, Alltech is sharing its expertise in microbiology, enzyme technology and nutrigenomics with SFAC to enhance environmental agriculture research in China. “Alltech has solutions to help livestock farms reduce pollution in animal manure, compost manure to a higher quality of organic fertilizer and improve crop and animal health and performance by adding nutritional value more naturally through our research-based technologies,” said Dr. Mark Lyons, Alltech’s global vice president and head of Greater China, who has been named vice president of the SFAC. ACE-ing it across the board From offering sustainable solutions and expertise in environmentally challenged China to providing viable, environment-friendly alternatives to inorganic trace minerals, chemicals and even plastic feed containers, these examples highlight the many ways Alltech is living up to a late-‘80s commitment to sustainable agriculture. The ACE principle is carrying forward a deeply embedded corporate-wide focus on safely sustaining the feeding of a world population that is beginning to outgrow the planet’s resources. Next in our ACE series: a look at the “A” in ACE.

Say goodbye to scheduling classes at your preference, weeknight parties and regular leisure time with friends. Say hello to schedules, deadlines, meetings and managers. As a recent graduate who has recently entered the workforce, I would like to share some tips to help you make a smooth transition from the classroom to the boardroom. Work is fun! Let’s address a few misconceptions. Work is not a boring place full of unimaginative people doing routine tasks and attending endless meetings. You get to know interesting people, start investing in a new wardrobe, practice language skills, learn new ways of doing things from experts in your chosen field and SO much more! Preparation, preparation, preparation. Make the time to put together a complete but brief resume (one page is ideal). An experienced recruiter for top companies recently wrote that it takes him less than 20 seconds to evaluate a candidate based on his/her resume. Your work experience may be limited, so focus on highlighting your academic and relevant extracurricular achievements. For example, mentioning you were the winner of a pie-eating contest will likely not impress your future employer; however, your role as president of a campus group would highlight your leadership strengths. It is important to be thorough and consistent in your writing, including tense, fonts, spellings, etc. Proofread your resume several times. Some universities even offer mock interviews where you can practice dressing appropriately and answering questions properly, and at the same time gain feedback on how to improve before the real thing. Find a company that excites you! A work environment that has a positive culture, shared values that foster innovation, teamwork and happy employees will get you fired up in the morning and keep you motivated. Look at company websites and social media platforms. Maybe you know people who work at that company. Ask them about their experiences. Consider reaching out to key people at that company through LinkedIn. You may not get hired. Looking for your first job is not easy. Even with all the right preparation, a potential employer may not see you as the right fit for the company. Do not give up! Excitement, rejection, patience and stress are all part of the job hunt. A good way to handle this is to develop a professional frame of mind. Start your day early, as if you worked in an office. Watch or read the news, or check headlines on your Twitter feed. Practicing this will help you get in the habit of waking up early and staying connected to current events, which can be great talking points and references in an interview.

Getting the flock off to the right start during brooding can help to positively impact health and performance throughout the flock’s life. There are five areas that must be monitored carefully during the brooding period: 1. Regulation of body temperature Chicks and poults are unable to regulate their internal body temperature during the first four to six days post-hatch (poults: 39.4–40°C or 103–104°F; chicks: 40–41°C or 104–106°F). While environmental temperature control is important for the entire flock, it is particularly critical during brooding, as it is important to not overheat nor overcool birds, which can greatly impact performance. Management guidelines for the breed will include the appropriate temperatures for the flock, and these temperatures may differ depending on whether the flock is from younger or older breeder hens. The producer must also consider the temperature of the floor and litter so that the entire environment, and not just the air, is at the correct temperature. 2. Skeletal and muscle system During their first week of life, poults and chicks gain around four times their original body weight. This significant increase in weight suggests rapid growth of the bird. A large part of this growth is aided by the first feeding phases given to the bird, which focus on nutrients to help with growth, as opposed to the end of the flock, when nutrients are focused on body maintenance. Nutrients such as protein, calcium, phosphorus and various minerals are required to help with this growth. Using minerals that are more bioavailable to the bird (e.g., Bioplex® and Sel-Plex®) and highly digestible proteins (e.g., NuPro®) can optimize growth during this time and the life of the flock. 3. Immune system Some breeder hen antibodies are passed on to the offspring through the yolk. These maternal antibodies help to protect the chick/poult during their first two to three weeks of age. However, these maternal antibodies do not complete the immune system of the young bird. Immune organs and immune tissue start developing in the embryo and the hatched bird. Additionally, active immunity is developing in the young bird from in ovo to the field through vaccinations and exposure to pathogens. If there is any stress on the bird, the immune system can be suppressed, negatively impacting health and performance. Depending on the situation, supporting the immune system during this period with various feed additives, such as Actigen®, Natustat®, Bioplex and Sel-Plex, can be beneficial to encourage the building of natural defenses. 4. Gastrointestinal system The gastrointestinal tract has many purposes, including barrier and immune function for disease protection, as well as the breakdown, digestion and absorption of feed and water that can be translated into production parameters. The small intestine is the main area where most of the feed is digested and absorbed. To efficiently absorb feed, there must be a large surface area in the intestinal tract. Increased villi numbers and villi height help to increase the surface area for absorption. The small intestine has rapid development from 17 days of incubation to about 10 days post-placement. During this critical time, the bird’s ability to efficiently digest and absorb nutrients, in addition to mounting strong disease defenses, is developed. 5. Microbiome Different areas of the bird have different microbiomes, such as the skin and intestinal tract. The intestinal tract microbiome is a part of the barrier function of the intestine. The stability of the microbiome involves a balancing act between the beneficial and opportunistic microbes, the latter of which are disease-causing under stress. Within a few hours of hatching, the small intestine is colonized by different bacterial groups. As the bird ages, the intestinal microflora population changes from immature to mature, reaching a stable balance within two to three weeks in the small intestine and up to six weeks in the ceca. Supporting the early establishment of a beneficial microflora community will allow villi to flourish, absorption to be maximized and the presence of pathogenic bacteria to be minimized. The diet of the bird, including nutrients and feed additives (such as Actigen, All-Lac® XCL and Acid-Pak 4-Way® 2X), as well as the water the bird drinks, can have an impact on the intestinal microflora. The poultry barn, especially the litter, has its own microflora that is highly influenced by the gut microflora, and vice versa. It may take several flock cycles to positively change the populations and profile of the poultry barn microflora. When the birds are first placed in the barn, it is critical that they gain immediate access to feed and water. Supplemental feed and water are generally used to allow for easy transition to the permanent feeding and water system. Many factors must be taken into consideration to help the birds get off to the right start during brooding, including best management practices, with particular attention to biosecurity, nutrition and health status.

ASF cannot be spread to humans and other non-swine animals and livestock and is not a threat to human health. However, humans can carry the virus on their clothing, shoes and equipment and can spread the disease unknowingly. Historically endemic to African countries, ASF has been spreading rapidly throughout Asia and parts of Europe through 2018 and 2019. What are the symptoms of ASF, what can we do to prevent the disease, and are there any treatment options? Signs and symptoms of ASF High fever (40.5–42oC) Sudden loss of appetite Hemorrhages on skin and internal organs, particularly lymph nodes Diarrhea, vomiting (sometimes with bloody discharge) Abortion Depression Coughing Difficulty breathing Sudden death High death loss While these symptoms are similar to classical swine fever (CSF), ASF is caused by a unique virus that is distinct from CSF. Unusually high mortality rates among pigs of all ages can be a strong indicator of ASF. However, the only way to know for sure which virus pigs might be infected with is through laboratory testing. If you notice any of the symptoms mentioned above in your herd, contact a vet as soon as you can to ensure that the correct quarantine and treatment are completed. This could help limit the damage on your farm. Tips to prevent ASF from entering your farm It is possible to keep ASF out of the farm, even in countries where ASF is endemic. Here are nine prevention measures you can take to avoid ASF. ​ 1. Implementation of strict importation measures for animal products: Ensure that neither infected live pigs nor pork products are introduced into areas free of ASF. ASF-positive countries can have their animal exportations restricted or prohibited as a result of the detection of infected meat. Check infected regions before importing products that could potentially be contaminated. 2. Proper disposal of all food waste from aircrafts or ships coming from infected countries. Furthermore, no human food waste should be fed to pigs. 3. Efficient sterilization and disposal of garbage: Avoid swill feeding (i.e., garbage feeding). Feeding of catering waste is a high-risk practice; if the food waste is contaminated with ASF, it can infect a healthy herd. Do not expose food waste that wild swine species could access. Carcasses, discarded parts from slaughtered pigs and food waste should be disposed of appropriately. 4. Rapid slaughtering of all pigs, infected or not (stamping out): Recovered or surviving animals are virus carriers for life. Therefore, to avoid spreading the disease to other pigs and to prevent relapse, it is safer to slaughter both infected and potentially infected pigs. Stamping out tends to be a short-term method to eradicate the disease. Nevertheless, it is generally the most cost-effective method that allows farms to be free from ASF in the shortest time. 5. Strict on-farm biosecurity: Keep viruses and bacteria out by complying with biosecurity rules, including proper disinfection of clothing and boots, as well as not bringing pork products that have not been properly heat-treated onto a farm. Farms should maintain dedicated footwear and clothing that stay on the farm. 6. Controlled animal and human movements: Pigs should be sourced from trusted and certified suppliers. Vehicles, equipment and people are also fomites of ASF. Ensure that anyone who enters the farm has not been in contact with any other pigs over the past 48 hours. Farm visitors who have been in countries that are ASF-positive need at least five days of downtime before entering the farm. Vehicles and equipment should be properly cleaned and disinfected before entering the premises. As secretions and excretions from sick or dead animals are a source of ASF, carcass-hauling trucks are high-risk and should not enter the farm. 7. Disease surveillance and monitoring: This is especially important when transporting live pigs and pork products. In addition, pig farms should maintain a strict health monitoring program. All sick or dead pigs should be inspected and examined for ASF. To detect ASF early, pigs slaughtered for own-home consumption should be inspected by an official veterinarian. Regarding staff training, holding regular prevention lectures and strengthening quality assessments as well as the daily records of feed ingredients is advised. 8. Efficient and early detection of the virus through laboratory tests: Notify a vet immediately upon spotting signs of ASF, and get the pigs tested. 9. Strict quarantine protocol: Strict quarantine measures should be applied in both ASF-free zones and infected zones to prevent the entry of the disease and/or to keep ASF from spreading further. Treatments for ASF Currently, there are no treatments or vaccinations available for this animal disease. Preventative and cautionary measures can be taken to protect animal health. Contact between sick and healthy animals can transmit ASF. Therefore, infected animals must be isolated and culled immediately upon confirmation of ASF. Did you know? North America and the Oceania region remain the only areas that have never had reported cases of ASF. ASF poses no risk to human health. Humans cannot get infected by ASF. ASF infects domestic and wild pigs, as well as a variety of soft-bodied ticks. Wild boars and warthogs can be carriers of ASF. Make sure they don’t come in contact with domestic pigs. Frozen meat from infected pigs can harbor the virus for up to six months. The ASF virus has been estimated to survive for up to 15 days in feces and five days in urine at 21°C. It takes 30 minutes of cooking at 70oC to deactivate ASF in meat products and 30 minutes at 60°C for serum and body fluids. Curing or smoking pork products does not destroy the virus. ASF can be transferred via feed (Niederwerder, et al., 2019). It is important to work with trusted suppliers and vendors to verify ingredient sources and determine what their biosecurity and quality programs entail. The importance of feed safety and a favorable health status Studies have shown that feed can be a carrier of certain harmful pathogens (Dee, et al., 2018). As an added layer of protection, put safeguards in place and utilize feed intervention technologies, such as acidifiers, to support the integrity and quality of your feed. Acidifiers are known to have beneficial properties that “control bacterial growth in feed, […] inhibiting growth of pathogenic microbes” (Jacela, et al., 2009). Products such as Guardicate™* have been shown to be effective for promoting feed safety and can be used as an important component of your farm’s greater biosecurity program. Over almost four years of research, Guardicate has shown its effectiveness as an acidifier, as it addresses feed quality concerns by helping maintain a favorable feed environment. Together with other solutions, like Sel-Plex®, Bioplex® and Actigen®, Alltech’s nutritional technologies provide peace of mind that you are safe from the risks that could negatively impact your production while promoting a positive health status for your animals. Improper mineral supply can have major consequences for the health and productivity of your herd. Improved mineral status has been shown to have a positive effect on immune function. The Alltech Mineral Management program focuses on feeding organic minerals such as Sel-Plex and Bioplex, which are better absorbed and utilized by the animal and, thus, can meet their nutrient needs for optimal health. Gut health and the microbiome also play a key role in maintaining the overall health status of the pig. Actigen is able to support immune function, gut microbial health and gut function and development, promoting overall animal health and performance. *Guardicate is only available in select countries.

In addition, our horses get to enjoy some long-awaited grass and increased turnout time, often trading in bulky winter blankets for lighter fly gear. Of course, everything has its downsides. I once read a quote that said, “Nothing is ever only good or bad. Everything is somewhere in the middle.” I think the same could most certainly be said about summer, for it brings both respite and risk. With this in mind, let’s explore four of the most commonly concerning summertime hazards associated with horses: 1. Heat stress: It is critical to build an understanding of how to keep horses cool in the summer, especially if you are planning to increase your horse’s time spent working under saddle. Since equines can easily overheat, heat stress in horses is something all equestrians should take very seriously. What may first simply appear to be poor performance can rapidly escalate to potentially fatal heat exhaustion or stroke. If you suspect that your horse is succumbing to overheating, you must act quickly by taking the following steps: Walk the horse out. This not only encourages circulation — it also helps bring heated blood to the surface of the skin for cooling and can help regulate body temperature. Let the horse drink its fill of cool water. Contrary to popular belief, allowing a hot horse to drink cold water will not cause colic and muscle cramping. Splash or spray cold water directly onto the horse and then scrape it off to aid with evaporative cooling. Repeat this process until the skin feels cool to the touch and the horse’s breathing appears to have returned to normal. If the horse’s behavior and drinking habits have not returned to normal within one hour, or if you witness more significant signs of heat stress before then, contact your veterinarian immediately. Intravenous hydration and other medical measures may be required to prevent potentially irreversible damage or loss of life. 2. Biting flies: Unfortunately, summer and flies are a package deal. And while stable flies and horse flies sometimes seem like nothing more than an ever-present annoyance, fly bites on horses can carry serious implications, such as disease transmission, weight loss, and hoof issues associated with stomping and restlessness. Even the most all-encompassing fly turnout gear can’t keep them completely at bay, but proper sanitation and stable management can go a long way in controlling the fly population of your barn. Fly management tips: Keep manure picked up, and pile it a good distance from facilities, waterers and paddocks. Make sure all garbage cans have tight-fitting lids and are cleaned out regularly. Keep waterers in good condition and place them away from areas where horses are fed. Consider screening any windows in the feed and tack rooms, as well as in box stalls. Use fans that direct airflow down and outward. This will help keep flies from entering barns. Fly traps and sticky paper are effective means of capturing flies, and they can also be useful in documenting fly numbers over time. A notable increase in flies caught from one week to the next could serve as an alert that it’s time to check on your sanitation measures and improve upon your fly-control techniques. Flies generally require a combination of breeding material, ideal moisture and adequate warmth to develop. Therefore, eliminating breeding sites is the key to a successful fly-control program. Barns and paddocks should be thoroughly cleaned once per week to assist in breaking fly life cycles. Insecticides should only be considered as a supplement to fly control. 3. Sweet itch: Contrary to its somewhat sugary-sounding name, sweet itch in horses is a serious nuisance. Also known as summer itch, this seasonal recurrent dermatitis is typically caused by an allergic reaction to a genus of biting midges known as Culicoides, commonly referred to as “no-see-ums” or gnats. Affected horses often become very itchy in the spring and may rub out their manes and tails in an attempt to relieve itchy skin. You may also notice skin irritation along their toplines, jaws, axillary regions and ventral midlines. Treatment options include supplementing diets with a source of omega-3 fatty acids, providing antihistamines or applying topical creams and insect repellents, but the best course of action is taking steps to prevent or eliminate the presence of these pests. You should regularly remove manure from both stalls and pastures and use stall fans to discourage gnats from lingering. Keep at-risk horses inside at dawn and dusk, as these are the most active feeding hours for midges. 4. Sunburn: Humans have grown increasingly concerned with skin health, especially when it comes to sun-related safety. However, it can be somewhat easy to overlook horse sunburn protection, despite a real need for it — particularly for those with white-skinned areas or pale coats. Sunburn most commonly affects the faces and heels of horses because these areas often have non-pigmented, pink skin patches and less hair coverage. Just as with humans, this condition can not only be painful but is recurrently associated with an increased likelihood of developing skin cancer. Owners must take preventative measures with horses prone to sunburn, such as stabling during daylight hours and providing overnight turnout time instead. Many human sunscreens are viable options for horses, and those containing zinc oxide are thought to be the most effective. However, you must reapply it at regular intervals for this method to be truly impactful. A full-face fly mask with ears and UV protection may also prove helpful.

In the recent webinar “Your Choice in Minerals Matters,” Dr. Jud Heinrichs, professor of dairy science at Penn State University, and Dr. Roger Scaletti, a trace mineral and milk quality expert at Alltech, got us back to the basics of mineral nutrition, helped us understand the differences in form and function, and brought some real-life examples into the equation. Most animal diets include daily supplementation of trace minerals, giving the producer and nutritionist a choice in what form of mineral they choose to use. What is the real difference between organic and inorganic minerals? Organic minerals are the form closest to nature, containing carbon molecules, Inorganic minerals are essentially ground-up rock with no carbon molecules attached to them. Importance of minerals When we increase trace mineral status above the benchmark level, we are then able to achieve optimum immune function and support the growth and fertility of the animal. Some trace minerals fed to livestock include zinc, copper, manganese and selenium. Understanding the importance of these trace minerals individually is key in understanding their real purpose in a ration. Zinc: Skin integrity, immune function, wound healing, sexual maturity, reproductive capacity. Copper: Bone strength, metabolism of iron, maturing process of red blood cells. Manganese: Metabolism, brain function, required for wound healing. Selenium: Immune function, white blood cell function, reproduction. Form defines function Organic trace minerals are closest to minerals found in food and feed ingredients, mimicking what Mother Nature does best. Form truly does define function and as a result can have significant impact on animal health and performance. Alltech, a supplier of organic trace minerals, has found through years of development and research that the proteinate form of a mineral is protected by the various layers of the digestive system, allowing the animal to receive the minerals and nutrients it needs to perform at its peak. Data reveals benefits of organic trace mineral supplementation in calves Heinrichs took a look at trace mineral availability and its importance for calves. Supplementing with organic minerals can aid in growth and immune function and can assist with disease issues common in fragile newborn calves. The two studies included: The Professional Animal Scientist 32: 205–213. 2016. Journal of Dairy Science 99: 2797–2810.2016. These studies compared organic trace minerals and inorganic trace minerals. Some key points included: Calves from dams on the organic mineral program experienced plasma haptoglobin less than 50 micrograms per milliliter approximately one-and-a-half fewer weeks than calves from inorganically fed dams. This data implies that feeding this organic mineral program to pregnant cows reinforces mineral status, leading to optimal overall health, immune status and reproductive function in the cow and calf. Type of trace minerals affects rumen bacteria and produces responses in ruminal fermentation. Organic trace minerals increased total volatile fatty acid (VFA) production and butyrate concentration. Higher bioavailability of the organic trace minerals suggests a faster utilization of the trace minerals and accelerated replication of ruminal microorganisms, stimulating ruminal fermentation and VFA production.

The poultry industry has taken the lead in terms of a more aggressive approach to reduce or eliminate antibiotic use and the pork industry is moving in a similar direction. Many areas around the world, including the European Union and the United States, have legislated the judicious use of antibiotics, while some consumers have pushed even further for “no antibiotics ever.” While some of these consumer demands may stem from misinformation, major change is at hand for traditional production. The pork industry has been diligently working towards reducing antibiotic use, while also keeping in mind the health and welfare of the animal and the end consumer. It is highly likely that consumers will soon turn their eyes to pig production with the same scrutiny and expectations they applied to the poultry industry. The process of going antibiotic-free can be arduous, but as some producers have been able to demonstrate, can also be done successfully without sacrificing animal health and wellness. Antibiotic resistance An increasing number of reports on antibiotic-resistant bacteria have raised concerns about the current use of antibiotics, both as a treatment for humans and to combat disease in animals. “Microbial resistance in pig production is usually a consequence of decades of antibiotic use for disease prophylaxis or growth promotion,” explained Dr. Anna Catharina Berge, owner of Berge Veterinary Consulting BVBA and academic advisor to Ghent University’s veterinary epidemiology unit, on the AgFuture podcast in 2018. “The antibiotics administered are not completely absorbed by the animals. If you’re giving an antibiotic to an animal, 30­­–90% of those antibiotics are actually excreted through the urine or feces.” Antibiotic growth promoters have been banned from animal feed in the EU since 2006. Until then, they had been routinely added to pig diets to promote digestive health and growth. However, many countries all over the world are now following the European example. In 2017, the Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) went into effect in the United States, limiting the use of antibiotics in animal production. “Though it comes with its challenges, the VFD has created a great opportunity for the industry to review what they are doing in terms of feeding their animals,” says Lori Stevermer, marketing manager for Hubbard Feeds. “Often, antibiotics were fed because that’s what was done in the past. Now, we need to work more closely with our veterinarians to determine what is best for our animals, and our future.” Reducing antibiotic use is a gradual process and requires a step-by-step approach. In an Alltech webinar held in conjunction with Pig Progress, Dr. Berge discussed antimicrobial resistance and the future of antibiotics in pig production, saying “the use of antimicrobials to prevent disease or treat a sick production system is not a sustainable practice.” Dr. Berge further suggest the three management tips below to combat disease and control antibiotic use: Implement a sound biosecurity plan Provide nutritional solutions that support pig growth and health Work with your veterinarian to get treatment recommendations Pork marketability Pork is one of the most widely consumed meats in the world. The 2020 Alltech Global Feed Survey highlighted the following statistics regarding the pork industry: Pigs accounted for 24% of overall global feed production in 2019. International feed tonnage decreased by 1.07% to 1.126 billion metric tons of feed produced — as a result of African swine fever (ASF) causing a decline of pig feed production in the Asia-Pacific region. In the U.S. alone, pigs accounted for 44.86 million metric tons of the country’s estimated 214 million metric tons of feed. The debilitating effects of ASF also come with opportunities for countries that can step in to supply the demand for pork in ASF-hit countries. Speaking at the launch of the 2020 Alltech Global Feed Survey, Bianca Martins, general manager of Alltech Mexico, said that this is already happening in Latin America. She explained that countries like Colombia, who have not had major pork export opportunities, are now developing trade with China. Note that since 2012, China has banned the use of ractopamine, an FDA-approved feed supplement that promotes lean meat growth. In 2013, Smithfield started phasing out ractopamine and other large companies, such as JBS and Tyson have since followed suit, further maximizing their export opportunities. Suppliers such as Hatfield Quality Meats and Niman Ranch provide antibiotic-free pork according to strict standards. In recent years, other industry-leading companies introduced antibiotic-free lines of fresh pork products, such as the Open Prairie Natural Pork line by Tyson and Pure Farms brand by Smithfield, both of which designate their pork products to be minimally processed with no antibiotics, steroids, hormones or artificial ingredients. While it is important to acknowledge that U.S. federal regulations prohibit the use of added hormones in pork production, these moves by large companies signal a growing trend in the pork industry. Changes in the way that we manage health in the livestock sector are not unique to the United States. Antibiotic-free pork production is flourishing in other countries, such as Denmark. In 1995, a program known as DANMAP was established by the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries and the Danish Ministry of Health for “surveillance of antimicrobial consumption and resistance in bacteria from animals, food and humans.” For more than 15 years, Danish farmers have only relied on antibiotics to treat illness in their herds. The program they follow allows for this therapeutic use and, when combined with other management techniques, such as delayed weaning, it has shown to be just as effective as traditional production. What can we learn from the Danish approach and can we apply it across different global markets in the swine industry? Antibiotic-free pig challenges According to Albert Finestra, a veterinarian and professor at the University of Lleida, who spoke at the Alltech ONE Conference in 2019, the challenges your herd will experience when you establish antibiotic-free pig production include these five issues: Diarrhea Infection Decrease in production weight Reduced water intake and feed consumption Susceptibility to stress These challenges increase production costs and, together with the threat of mortality, are issues that producers do not take lightly. It is these types of health and welfare challenges that producers take into consideration before implementing a complete antibiotic-free production, which is why a step-down process has been successful with many producers. Transitioning your herd away from traditional use of antibiotics requires strategic planning and the implementation of counteractive measures to minimize the effect it could have on animal welfare and your operation’s bottom line. During the transition, new costs are likely to occur as opportunities are captured and higher revenue is generated due to the increased sale value for antibiotic-free products. A step-down approach: how to reduce antibiotic use While seemingly demanding, there are some ways the issues of going antibiotic-free, or even reducing the use of antibiotics, can be addressed. There is evidence that pigs might not only be less susceptible to infectious risks but may, in fact, thrive when certain natural feeding supplements are added to the diet. Two key areas to focus on are biosecurity and nutrition. Effective biosecurity can not only help producers manage disease challenges, but also prevent the increased risks of many of the issues listed above. Required measures may include changes to: Animal flow Increased focus on housing and transportation cleanliness Implementing heightened security on those entering the facilities, whether that be a worker from another farm or a small rodent visitor We must keep in mind that a healthy gut is the key to a healthy pig, and major emphasis is placed on optimizing the gut health and welfare of your herd through a sound nutrition program. A healthy gut is not only a gut without disease; it is an effective digestive organ that can mount a good defense against disease and easily cope with change. The presence of infectious organisms in the gut is not enough to cause disease; disease occurs when the pathogen breaks down the gut’s defenses. As gut commensal microflora are disrupted, dysbiosis occurs between the beneficial microbiota and the potential disease-causing organisms, and it becomes easier for pathogens to damage the gut structure and function. Prebiotics, probiotics and post-biotics can assist the gut in adapting and minimizing dysbiosis. The establishment and maintenance of good gut function are vitally important for reducing piglet morbidity and mortality. Piglet nutrition is a critical component in the establishment of normal gut function, from digestion and absorption to barrier function and the development of the immune system. It is important to ensure good colostrum and milk production in sows to help further develop the piglet’s immune system. Weaning disorders are some of the most common — and damaging — problems in pig production, resulting in antibiotics being used post-weaning to protect the stressed gastrointestinal (GI) tract and immune systems of the piglets. In a healthy production system, it is essential to help prepare the piglet for weaning as early as possible after birth. At the time of weaning, it is important to minimize six stressors such as: Transport Comingling of litters Large weaner groups Diet Poor air quality Unhygienic conditions Use of nutritional technologies such as Viligen ®, help piglets get started on feed, easing post-weaning transition. Solutions such as the Alltech® Antibiotic Reduction program aim to help producers foster consistently healthy pigs and make prophylactic and metaphylaxic antibiotic use redundant. This program assists the producer in developing an action plan that is tailored to their production system. Feed additives and nutritional solutions are valuable tools for maintaining gut health in pig production, but these supplements alone are not sufficient to create a healthy production system. Often, there are more complex steps that must be taken beyond simply feeding additives, including updating management routines and resource allocation and needs. Audits to establish the baseline current situation — and recurrent audits to monitor progress — are important in order to stay motivated and continue a steady rate of progress. In addition to gut health and nutritional components, the Alltech Antibiotic Reduction program audits include evaluations of: Performance Pig welfare Pig respiratory and systemic health Reproductive performance Management Housing Antimicrobial use Biosecurity Cost-effectiveness of production Through the Alltech Antibiotic Reduction program, producers can achieve increased productivity and reduce antibiotic usage in pigs — with the added benefit of the rewarding sense that they are part of the global action plan to use our valuable antibiotics responsibly in order to ensure their viability for future generations. Pathway to antibiotic-free Some producers are ahead of the trend and have been practicing antibiotic-free production for many years. “When we accepted the challenge to go antibiotic-free from birth to market a few years ago, it proved to be a real challenge,” said Everett Forkner of Forkner Family Farms in Richards, Missouri. “But with the addition of nutritional innovations, we have not only been able to meet the challenge, we are producing more efficiently than when we began.” Each farm is different, requiring each nutritional program to be tailored to meet the needs of that production’s animals and their environment for a truly effective antibiotic-free approach. When asked about the key steps to take when making this transition, Forkner said, “Establishing the right nutritional platform takes time. You have to allow some time for adjustments in order to really see what is best for the animals. And for us as a livestock breeder, it has also been about selecting superior animals and genetic lines that have more natural health and stronger immune systems. “On top of this, a major component for us has been building this into a comprehensive immunization program while enhancing our management procedures,” Forkner continued. “This combination has been what has helped us go multiple years and generations of genetic selection with no antibiotic support.” To be truly effective, achieving antibiotic-free production cannot be done by taking a silver-bullet approach. When antibiotics are reduced or removed, the front line of defense may be nutrition, but that is just the start. A combination of strategies must be put into effect. By powering nutrition with technologies designed to support the animals’ immune and digestive systems, and by implementing a full program focused on maintaining proper health, producers give their operations the best chance for a sustainable and profitable future.

Many of us — our pets included — enjoy more outdoor activities during this time of year, but it’s imperative to remember that dogs and hot weather don’t always mix. Building an understanding of how to keep your pets cool in the summer is essential. Even backyard summer picnics and barbecues can quickly become dangerous for our four-legged friends, as many human foods are toxic for dogs. So, what steps can you take to keep man’s best friend safe? 1. Provide adequate water. Dehydration can happen quickly and have serious consequences. Understanding how to prevent dehydration in dogs is essential. Always have fresh, clean water on hand, especially when it’s particularly hot or humid outside. Early signs of dehydration in dogs include: Loss of skin elasticity Reduced energy Dry mouth and gums Dry nose Excessive panting You should offer a mildly dehydrated dog small amounts of water every few minutes. Providing too much water too quickly could cause vomiting, which would only further dehydrate the animal. More serious signs of dehydration may include: Vomiting and diarrhea or loss of appetite Sunken, dry eyes Loss of coordination Weakness Signs of shock, such as rapid heart rate, a weakened pulse or shivering Severely dehydrated dogs need immediate medical attention and often require rehydration through intravenous fluids. Call your veterinarian as soon as you notice the first signs of severe dehydration. 2. Understand the signs of overheating in dogs. Overheating is often linked to dehydration, as dogs are unable to regulate their body temperature as efficiently as humans. Panting and vasodilation in the ears and face play a key role in helping overheated dogs cool down. Overheating can lead to heat exhaustion and potentially deadly heat stroke. Brachycephalic or flat-faced breeds, such as bulldogs, pugs and boxers, are especially prone to overheating in the summer months because their facial anatomy prevents them from panting efficiently. Overweight dogs and those with dark coats are also at increased risk. Contact your veterinarian immediately if you notice any of the following signs: Body temperature in excess of 103 degrees Fahrenheit (102.5 is normal; temperatures of 106 or higher can damage internal organs and prove fatal) Heavy panting Excessive drooling Bright red gums Rapid or irregular pulse Seizures or muscle tremors Loss of coordination or consciousness 3. Don’t shave your dog. Many well-intentioned owners naturally equate more fur with a warmer dog in the summer months and are inspired to shave their pets in order to provide them relief, but this is not generally wise. Shorthaired, single-coated dogs are typically more heat-tolerant by nature, but the fur on double-coated breeds, such as Australian shepherds, Shelties and Samoyeds, are actually dual-purpose, keeping them both warm in the winter and cool in the summer. Learn more about why shaving doesn’t keep your dog cool. 4. Never leave your pet unattended in your vehicle. Even when you leave the windows cracked or park in a shady spot, the temperature inside your car can climb in excess of 100 degrees Fahrenheit in a matter of minutes during warmer months. If you can’t take your dog inside with you at each of your destinations, either drop them off at home before you complete your errands or leave them there to begin with. 5. Be sensible about hot-weather exercise and play. This is important to keep in mind as you exercise your dog to ensure that they don’t overdo it. Choose cooler times of the day, such as early morning or evening, or consider going for a swim or running through the sprinkler instead. Not all dogs are strong swimmers, so it’s important not to leave them unattended around pools and other bodies of water. If you’re exercising on hot pavement, asphalt or sand, don’t forget your dog’s paws. If these surfaces are too hot to walk on with your bare feet, the same will be true for your dog; as such, it’s best to put dog booties on them or wait until the footing cools down. 6. Avoid getting into the habit of feeding your dog people food. Not only does this often lead to unwelcome behaviors like begging, it can also embolden your dog to scavenge for scraps and prey on unsuspecting visitors who might inadvertently provide your pooch with items that are potentially dangerous. Backyard barbecues are ripe with risky temptations, such as: Cooked bones: Dogs and bones don’t always go together. Cooked bones can easily splinter into dangerous shards that may lead to choking or cause other serious damage to a dog’s mouth, throat or digestive tract. Rich foods: That creamy potato salad or mayonnaise-infused dip may seem like a good idea at first, but if we’re not used to such rich flavor, it can come back to haunt us in the form of gastrointestinal upset. The same holds true for your dog. Onions: These classic burger toppings may add great flavor to your meal, but they contain a substance that is toxic for dogs and can damage their red blood cells, leading to anemia. Grapes or raisins: Both are highly toxic and can lead to acute kidney failure, even in small amounts. Corn on the cob: While corn itself is not toxic to dogs, the cob is a choking hazard that could also lead to intestinal obstruction and an emergency vet visit. Chocolate: Ingestion of this sweet indulgence might also spur an emergency visit to the vet, depending on the type and amount of chocolate consumed, as well as the size of your dog. 7. Think before you light those fireworks. If your dog is afraid of thunder, odds are that he or she will also be afraid of the loud noises associated with fireworks. A dog’s hearing is far more sensitive than our own, and they can hear sounds four times further away than we can. Imagine what a boom that is loud to us sounds like to our dogs. If you have an anxious dog that is fearful of loud noises, do your utmost to keep them calm and comfortable, ideally leaving them indoors in a covered crate that might create an added sense of security and safety. Provide a distraction, such as a favorite chew toy, and turn up the TV or radio to help drown out the outdoor noise. 8. Don’t forget about flea, tick and heartworm prevention. More time spent outdoors means that pets are at an increased risk for complications associated with pests. As Dutch philosopher Desiderius Erasmus is thought to have said, “Prevention is better than cure.” Fleas are prevalent in neighborhood mice and rabbits and can easily transfer to your pet, causing issues like excessive itching and hair loss. They can also be a nightmare to get rid of once they are in your home. Ticks are perhaps less of a nuisance than fleas but can transmit serious illnesses, such as Lyme disease, which predominantly causes lethargy and recurrent lameness due to joint inflammation. Prevention is ideal. There are several highly effective flea and tick preventatives on the market today; ask your veterinarian for recommendations. Heartworm is spread by mosquito bites and is a serious and potentially fatal disease. Fortunately, however, it is considered almost 100% preventable in dogs and cats. Even if your pet spends the majority of its time indoors, it’s important to provide a regular heartworm preventative, which must be prescribed by your veterinarian.

As they took their seats, they found a surprise on the table: Kit Kat candy bars. Only a group of dairy industry devotees would get the humor — and the connection. Nestlé, one of the world's 50 largest companies (and producer of Kit Kat, along with baby foods and other milk-based products among its 2,000 brands), was about to announce its new partnership with global animal health and nutrition leader Alltech, organizer of the annual Alltech global conference for dairy and beef producers. Their mutual endeavor: the Nestlé Dairy Farming Institute (DFI) in Shuangcheng in Heilongjiang province in northeast China. A major investment for both companies, the Institute, launched in October 2014, is helping modernize Chinese dairy farming practices so farmers can meet the population's burgeoning milk demand. While it has not traditionally been a staple in the Chinese diet, milk is on the move in Asia. China is now one of the fastest growing markets for milk products globally. A 2014 study by the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy found that in the past three decades, both dairy production and consumption in China have soared, averaging a 12.8 percent annual growth rate since 2000.The nation's dairy consumption is expected to increase 38 percent by 2022, driven not only by traditional milk, yogurt and cheese products but also the introduction of new product concepts in China such as drinkable yogurts and milk-based juices. The nation's dairy consumption is expected to increase 38 percent by 2022. \"Milk is becoming a vital part of the Chinese diet,\" said Hans Joehr, Nestlé's head of Agriculture. \"The Institute represents our commitment to helping China move its dairy sector to the next stage of development in a sustainable and efficient manner.\" The DFI is geared to help gain consumers' confidence in locally produced milk and their trust in Chinese authorities. \"The essence is that DFI will help society so farmers and businesses that use milk can stay in business. It's a very powerful thing to bring to the market. This has never been done before,\" he said. Why did Nestlé select Alltech as its partner in this project? \"It's a strategic alignment,\" said Joehr, explaining that Nestlé cannot accomplish its goal in China by itself. \"It's like building a car. Even if you have a good chassis — Nestlé — what good is it if you don't have a good engine — Alltech?\" To produce its line of baby foods, he added, Nestlé needs the highest quality milk available. That starts with healthy milking cows. Describing Alltech as the \"extra ingredient\" needed to help farmers raise healthy cows, Joehr said Alltech understands the nutrition cows need to produce healthy milk for Nestlé's consumer products. “It's like building a car. Even if you have a good chassis — Nestlé — what good is it if you don't have a good engine —Alltech?” - Hans Joehr, Nestlé's head of Agriculture He pointed in particular to the company's widely recognized expertise in the milk industry and in optimal care for production animals. \"It's an end-to-end approach. You need a complete competence chain to please your client.\" Joehr underscored that Nestlé considers DFI to be a long-term project, \"not for just a year or two.\" That's why its alignment with Alltech is so crucial. \"We chose Alltech because of the attitude and vision of its leaders. They are reflected in the value set of the company. I have known Dr. Pearse Lyons (Alltech founder and president) and his family for many years. He has credibility and trust,\" he said, adding that Nestlé prefers to work with farmers and suppliers like Alltech that are owner-operated and like-minded. Nestlé and Alltech share several strengths that are key to DFI's success, among them a commitment to education, which is an integral part of the project. Faculty members at DFI, each of whom brings specialized competences, hail from the University of Wisconsin Madison, Northeast Agricultural University and the Farm Comparison Network (IFCS). Since its opening six months ago, the Institute has held six classes on feed, as well as genetics programs and on-farm training. Both companies have had boots on the ground in China for more than 20 years. Nestlé established three milk districts in China, in Shuangcheng, Laixi in Qingdao and Hulunbeier in Inner Mongolia. Alltech has a strong presence with an office in Beijing, which is run by Dr. Mark Lyons, global vice president, Alltech and head of Alltech China business operations. \"We are proud to be part of Nestlé's magnificent project in one of the most important regions of the Chinese dairy industry,\" said Lyons. \"I am confident that Alltech's contribution, backed by 35 years of experience, will be significant in helping Chinese farmers sustainably increase their production efficiency and become more profitable.\" Partnering with Nestlé is one of numerous projects included in its \"China Now\" program. China, as a critical player in global agribusiness, is a priority focus for Alltech, and China Now reflects the resources the company has invested to strengthen its local support within the market. Fundamental to this strategy are partnerships with other businesses as well as universities. Within the last two years, Alltech has finalized formal research alliances with seven Chinese universities and research institutions — the Chinese National Feed Quality Control Center in Beijing; Northwest A&F University; Zhejiang University; South China Agriculture University; Jiangnan University; Ocean University of China; and the Ministry of Agriculture Feed Industry Centre (MAFIC) — to focus on intensive, solution-driven research. Alltech brings to DFI a feed evaluation laboratory with the In Vitro Fermentation Model (IFM), a diagnostic tool that simulates rumen fermentation and evaluates the nutritive value of total mixed rations. Through IFM diagnostics, Chinese dairy nutritionists and farmers are not only be able to get evaluations and recommendations for dairy rations to maximize feed efficiency and combat ever-rising feed costs, but also obtain estimates of the amount of energy lost as methane and methane emissions per animal. In the rapidly developing Chinese dairy industry, such new technology helps dairy productivity to continue to improve while providing insight into new and more precise ways to evaluate feedstuffs and reduce environmental impact. “Alltech is our worldwide partner, not just our partner in the DFI.” - Hans Joehr Noting Alltech's long-standing relationship with Nestlé, as well as Nestlé's excellence in collaborating and improving the supply chain, Dr. Pearse Lyons, president and founder of Alltech, pointed to the important role of Alltech's new lab at the DFI. The lab provides state-of-the-art feeding technologies to improve the health of dairy cows and increase milk yield, which will assist farmers in making feeding decisions. What does the future hold for the Alltech-Nestlé alliance? \"Alltech is our worldwide partner, not just our partner in the DFI,\" said Joehr, who recently met with Alltech's crop specialists in Brazil. He said Nestlé and Alltech plan to work together in South America, where Alltech has a strong team, in cocoa research and eventually expand into all cocoa-producing countries. \"This will end up with the best milk chocolate in the future!\" he said. The Nestlé Dairy Farming Institute in Shuangcheng, Heilongjiang province, China, features Alltech’s cutting-edge technology feed evaluation laboratory. Dr. Neil Xu, research manager, Alltech China; Dr. Karl Dawson, chief scientific officer, Alltech; Dr. Anne Koontz, research scientist, Alltech China; Shelly Ji, laboratory technician, Alltech China; and Dr. Mark Lyons, global vice president, Alltech, were present at its official opening in October 2014.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/nestle-alltech-dairys-dynamic-duo-china","title":"\n\n                    Nestlé & Alltech: Dairy's dynamic duo in China\n                    ","date":"February 2, 2016","contentLength":1291}},{"pageContent":"Following our annual Global Feed Survey, we decided to dive a little deeper into aquaculture this year and produce our first Aquaculture Feed Survey.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the greatest shares of salmon feed production were in Norway (94 percent), Canada (86 percent) and Chile (85 percent). How do shrimp and salmon compare overall? Shrimp accounts for 21 percent of global aqua feed production, 82 percent of which occurs in Asia. Salmon, meanwhile, accounts for 11 percent globally, with Europe as the center of production (52 percent of global salmon feed).

Incidents of tail-biting, in particular, are among the top behavioral problems in gilt development units (GDUs) and grow-finish pigs that can lead to economic losses due to reductions in gain, secondary infections, death or carcass condemnations. What are the causes of tail-biting in pigs? Studies have shown that pigs are attracted to the taste and sight of blood, and if a pig draws blood from accidentally biting a pen-mate’s tail, doing so could elicit the negative behavior in that individual pig or even spread to the entire group of pigs. However, natural behavior is only one piece of the puzzle. Numerous other factors can increase the prevalence of tail-biting, such as environmental stressors (e.g., temperature variation, lighting, ventilation, etc.), dietary issues and health challenges. Four tips on how to prevent tail-biting in pigs Start with the basics: Feed, water, ventilation, temperature and stocking density Feed: Providing ready access to feed is essential for optimizing average daily gains. Conversely, restriction of or inadequate access to feed will cause slower growth and can contribute to aggressive behavior, such as tail-biting. Feed restriction is most commonly caused by out-of-feed events that are the result of equipment malfunctions, feed bridging or feed management errors. The second-most common cause of feed restriction is feeder settings being adjusted too tightly. Water: Just as with feed, it is important to provide ready access to drinking water. Restricting the water intake of pigs can lead to reduced feed intakes and may also contribute to aggressive behavior. Make sure all of the pigs have enough water access points and that the flow rate is adequate enough to meet their water needs. Ventilation: Poor ventilation, especially in the late fall and winter months, can quickly induce aggressive behaviors. Make sure the ventilation is adequate enough to at least remove pit gasses from your facility. Poor air quality in barns irritates animals and is a major catalyst accelerating aggression in pigs. Temperature: In warmer months, heat stress is of great concern and is something that barn managers and employees should keep an eye on. When pigs reach their upper critical temperature, they begin to experience heat stress, which can trigger negative behaviors, such as tail-biting. Stocking density: Overstocking induces extra stress in animals due to the increased competition for feed and water resources in the pen. As such, it is critically important to relieve stocking density by evenly distributing pigs throughout all of the pens. Limited space in pens is a common trigger for tail-biting. Provide balanced nutrition Nutritional imbalances or improperly balanced diets are contributing factors that can increase the likelihood of aggressive behavior. Under-budgeting and/or under-formulating lysine for high lean growth genetics can lead to vice behavior by restricting the genetic growth potential of the animal. Inadequate sodium in the diet can also lead to aggressive behavior. Look for signs of health challenges Significant viral challenges, like PRRS and the flu, can lead to increased incidences of aggressive behavior in pigs. Consult your veterinarian on the best course of action to relieve any health challenges in your operation. Keep calm and entertain Pigs are naturally very curious animals that utilize their mouths as a means of exploring and learning more about their environment. As such, providing enrichment that is stimulating and that biologically relieves stress is crucial. The AllBite block, from Hubbard Feeds and Alltech, is a molasses-based block designed to discourage tail-biting and other aggressive vice behaviors. AllBite adds a new stimulus to the pigs’ environment, thus allowing pigs to exhibit foraging behaviors and to bite and chew on the block instead of their pen-mates. AllBite combats aggressive behavior through two mechanisms: it contains biologically active calming agents that reduce stress within the pen, and it is delivered in a form that provides a sensory stimulus to a group of pigs. Researched and tested in the field, AllBite has a 93% success rate in reducing or stopping tail-biting. The key is early identification, followed by the introduction of AllBite into pens where tail-biting and other aggressive behaviors are occurring. While changing diets to mitigate negative behaviors is a common practice, dietary changes are often not implemented early enough to effectively prevent those negative behaviors from manifesting. Also, most vice behaviors only affect a small group within a larger population, so changing diets can sometimes become costly. With its unique delivery system, AllBite addresses both issues, since blocks can be placed in pens as soon as tail-biting occurs, and the blocks are only supplemented in the pens where pigs are exhibiting vice behaviors. During a tail-biting outbreak, it is important to try and identify the biters and treat and/or remove the bitten pigs to prevent the behavior from spreading to other pigs. The root of vice and aggressive behavior is multi-factorial, and the mechanisms of this behavior are not fully understood. However, a quick response is key to helping prevent or stop vice behaviors in pigs. Tail-biting is a universal concern, and, as animal caretakers, maintaining the welfare of our pigs is our daily responsibility.

Heat stress can take a serious toll on pig performance, especially in breeding herds and finisher pigs. Heat and wide fluctuations in temperature are often immensely stressful for the animals, resulting in diminished performance, health problems and, eventually, economic losses for the farmer. Why are pigs so sensitive to heat stress? Pigs are extremely sensitive to changes in temperature because they do not have functional sweat glands and, therefore, do not have a way of efficiently cooling themselves. In addition, pigs have relatively small lungs for their body size, making it difficult for them to remove excess internal heat. “Even during the hottest time of the day, pigs are still producing additional body heat from eating and moving around the barn,” said Russell Gilliam, U.S. swine business leader for Alltech. “Since pigs have few sweat glands, cooling off by perspiration is not much of an option. Respiratory rates begin to increase at around 70° Fahrenheit, and with high humidity, it becomes difficult for pigs to find relief from the heat on their own.” Temperature fluctuations that continue from the summer into the fall season produce additional challenges. Wide variations in temperature between night and day can compound the stress that the animals already experienced as a result of increased temperatures. What are the symptoms of heat stress in pigs? One of the negative effects of heat stress is reduced feed intake. When pigs eat less, they convert less feed into muscle, thus reducing average daily gain (ADG) and potentially increasing their days to market. In turn, this can also lead to a heightened risk of health challenges and, ultimately, additional costs for producers. Other symptoms include: Increased respiratory rate (panting) Excessive water intake and increasing loss of electrolytes Reduced activity Lying stretched on the floor, often separated from others 6 management strategies to reduce heat stress in pigs Although stress cannot be completely avoided, the goal should be to minimize it as much as possible. Below are some quick tips for reducing heat stress and its negative effects: Control the temperature, and make sure the temperature only shifts a few degrees in the barn. Ensure that each pig has enough space and ventilation. Coincide feeding times with the cooler parts of the day (e.g., earlier or later in the day). Provide pigs with unlimited access to fresh and cool drinking water. Move and transport work pigs early, keep them in groups and let them set the pace. Spend time with them prior to the move to ease their stress. Tailor their diets to include technologies that will support them during stress. Balancing temperature, ventilation and humidity When pigs are kept at temperatures above their comfort zone, feed intake is sure to decrease, as are daily gains. In modern swine barns, pigs are at a greater risk of experiencing heat stress than cold stress. Ensure that all fans, sprinklers, cool cells and other cooling equipment are adequately maintained so that they will function properly during the hot summer months. In addition, make sure that your barn is properly ventilated to provide pigs with an optimal environment. Even if the thermostat reading falls within the pigs’ comfort zone, what they are actually experiencing may still be stressful. Effective temperature is a concept similar to wind chill and heat index. For example, 60°F is a favorable temperature for a 125-pound pig. However, 60°F combined with a high air speed (e.g., 100 feet per minute) would be cold and, consequently, the pig would be forced to divert energy away from growth to maintaining its body temperature. Chart 1 shows how wind speed affects temperature. Chart 1: Effects of wind speed on temperature Air speed (ft./min.) Temperature adjustment (°F) 0 0 30 -7 90 -13 300 -18 The temperature within the barn needs to be adequately adjusted to account for the additional heat production from the growing pig. For every 60–80 pounds of gain, the pig will produce an additional 200 Btu of heat every hour, so the cubic feet per minute (CFM) must be properly adjusted to account for the increasing heat production. Chart 2: Recommended ventilation rates, CFM per pig Pig weight, lbs. Minimum Mild weather Hot weather 30–75 lbs. 3 15 45 75–150 lbs. 7 24 75 150–280 lbs. 10 35 120 Effects of humidity Humidity is also an important indicator of proper ventilation. During warmer months, when the outside temperature exceeds the set point, increasing ventilation rates will not decrease humidity in the barn because warm air has a higher water-holding capacity than cooler air. Pigs can develop heat stress at much lower temperatures when the humidity is high, so humidity, along with temperature, needs to be carefully regulated in the barn. It is recommended to operate at a relative humidity of 65% or less, as this level of humidity will decrease condensation and wet floors in the barn. Tailoring diets to support stress Data has shown that offering pigs a combination of organic acids, electrolytes, enzymes and probiotics, such as those included in Acid-Pak 4-Way®, can support young animals during times of stress. Organic acids promote probiotic growth in the gut, and enzymes can help enhance intake and digestibility. Electrolytes keep the animal hydrated, especially in times of heat stress. Addressing heat stress and being prepared for its effects can have a major impact on the performance and overall value of your pigs when you take them to market. It can also help reduce the cost of added days on feed and additional health costs. In times of stress, pigs can be more susceptible to disease and health challenges. It is essential that your pigs’ nutrition is bolstered by technologies that build their natural immunity.

Experienced in shooting on-location throughout the world, including recently in Mexico, Europe and China, this was the team’s first shoot in California, the number one milk producing state in the U.S. To put that ranking in context, the average herd size in California is more than 1000 for a dairy; in the second-ranking milk state, Wisconsin, the herd size is closer to 100. Frank and Susan Fagundes have a 700-cow dairy, with mostly Holsteins who were not quite sure they were interested in a camera close-up. Although Alan’s crew typically shoots with a Canon C-100 and DSLR with interchangeable lenses, the size of the dairy required a different approach: a drone. The Alltech team has been using a small drone for a couple years, and, according to Alan, it’s already become an essential part of the team’s storytelling toolbox. At the Fagundes dairy, the Alltech team envisioned the drone capturing the family walking with their dog among the cattle, illustrating the scale of the operation as well as the unique—albeit dusty (a camera challenge due to the drought!)—California landscape. Drones add a certain element, however, to the dynamics of filming. Humans, cows and dogs all respond differently to the flying object. In this particular case, the drone almost became puppy chow. “The Fagundes’ German Shepherd was determined to do his duty and protect them all from this invader,” said Alan. So how did the cows handle their close-up? Despite the fact that the drone must “look and sound like the biggest fly on the planet” to them, they did surprisingly well, according to the team. There was only one instance in which they almost initiated a stampede. Alan emphasized, however, that safety in these shoots is always paramount. The drones are never used without permission and only used with complete human and animal safety in mind. In fact, studies are already being conducted to determine the minimum safe distances between drones and animals to avoid disturbing them. Even in terms of the overall shoot, camera tripod legs get equipped with the same biosecurity footwear as a human. For the Alltech film crew, all the efforts are incredibly rewarding. “Farmers work hard and don't always have the time to tell their own stories,” said Alan. “We're happy that we are able show how much dedication, passion and care can go into what they do, which ultimately is feeding the rest of us.

Compounded by a growing population, the dairy industry will need to produce 600 billion kilograms more milk. This means today’s dairy cow will either need to double her production, or we will need to dramatically increase cow numbers! Over the last 25 years, we have increased milk production by 61 percent (about 2 percent per annum) — but can we continue to grow sustainably? The difference between a high and low performing cow can be considerable. Milk production — judged by weight — is influenced by genetics and nutrition, but also by inconsistency in mixing of feed, eating behaviors (such as sifting), other cows’ bullying, water quality (or lack thereof!) and environmental factors, such as heat. In ever larger and more intensive production environments, with fewer people wanting to work on farms, management is emerging as an even more significant challenge. In such a setting, dairy farming has focused on managing the average cow, not the individual. A glaring gap for dairy farmers is data. Farms, especially large ones, don’t know how much an individual cow eats, how much she drinks, how much she moves, her body temperature, stress levels, sickness, etc. Even individual milk production isn’t always recorded in a consistent manner. How can farmers manage cow comfort, select the best animals for breeding and retaining, judge true profitability, meet prosumer demands for animal welfare and sustainability and raise the bar in terms of milk production? Without precise, real-time, smart data, the task of managing individual cows is nearly impossible. But emerging digital technologies could fill that data gap. Sensors More than any other technological advancement, sensors can fill the data gap in dairy farming, particularly when animals are outside in a field. Before the use of technology, monitoring an individual cow’s health was difficult, time consuming and cost-intensive. However, the use of sensors and wearable technologies allows farmers to monitor individual cows. No longer do producers have to work from herd averages; they are now able to determine individual illness or lameness more effectively and react accordingly, quite possibly before milk production or the rest of the herd is affected. Wearable sensors have proven valuable in managing a cow’s health, and there is no shortage of companies producing this type of technology. Leaders — such as SCR Dairy, which is assessed to have about 80 percent of the market share — produce all manner of wearables worn on a cow’s ears, neck, legs or tail. They can even be implanted subcutaneously or inside the rumen. Sensors help monitor cow comfort and welfare. Cows need to rest for an average of 11 hours per day; any less than that affects blood flow to the udder and can negatively impact milk yield. Sensors can detect a lack of locomotion and alert producers when to circumvent these negative effects. Sensors can be used to detect disease signals that are otherwise hard for farmers to notice, such as mastitis. AfiMilk, Agricam, Fullwood, DeLaval, Lely, LIC Automation, MastiLine and Wakaito all claim to detect mastitis in cows and provide producers with early opportunities to combat the issue. Rumination is also vital to a cow’s production, and sensors designed to be located inside the rumen can monitor acidity levels through a digitally connected bolus. Companies that offer acid monitors — like Smartbow, which was a participant in the Pearse Lyons Accelerator — allow farmers to detect digestive problems, such as ruminal acidosis. Livestock Labs has created a tracking technology called EmbediVet, which is implanted underneath the cow’s skin using a local anesthetic. This tracker claims to be less bothersome than wearable sensors and more accurate in gathering data and monitoring behavior.Ingenera offers a line of various sensor products designed to measure cow conformation, weight, udder health and other body metrics. Moocall, also a participant in the Pearse Lyons Accelerator, produces sensors that detect the heat cycle of the cow by evaluating her responsiveness to a teaser bull. His proximity and behavior can determine her receptivity and alert the farmer's smart device if she is in heat. Afimilk makes a pedometer for cows, alerting farmers of the best time for insemination on the basis that cows walk and move more as they come into estrus. ​ Image courtesy of MooCall Moocall also makes the Moocall Calving sensor, a wearable that attaches to the cow’s tail and monitors her contractions. Connected to the producer’s mobile phone, it sends an alert one hour before active calving, allowing farmers to minimize time spent checking pregnant cows and increase efficiency in time management. Outside of wearables on cows, there are other examples of sensors in the dairy industry. The startup SomaDetect has developed a sensor that enables farmers to know what is in the milk they produce. Specifically, there is an in-line sensor that measures milk fat, protein, somatic cell counts, progesterone and antibiotic residues (not allowed for human consumption) at every milking. Danish company Foss Analytics has a similar business model, using sensors and NIR. ENGS systems is implementing their free-flow technology through the Advanced Milk Meter. It collects data on the cow’s individual milk flow rate, quantity, temperature and electrical conductivity and transfers the data to a milk management program for farmers to use. Artificial intelligence Big data promises precision agriculture; however, if farmers can’t interpret the data and use it to take action, the data is useless. Artificial intelligence allows producers to analyze the data collected by sensors and other hardware technologies and can provide interpretations and solutions by mimicking human decision-making — potentially transforming how a dairy farm operates. SCR Dairy is implementing cow, milk and herd intelligence through their sensors and artificial intelligence technologies. They offer sensors ranging from heat detection and calving to health monitoring sensors — including the SenseTime Solution sensor, which detects and charts a cow’s daily activities, such as ruminating, eating and walking patterns. When paired with artificial intelligence software, this sensor provides users with early, proactive solutions to problems. Along with the capability to record information about reproduction, health and nutrition, the sensor also provides farmers with solutions for each individual cow. ​ Image courtesy of Cainthus Cainthus has developed algorithms for facial recognition software that can monitor a cow’s activity. There is no need for the cows to wear any sort of tracking device, and this software may eliminate the need for wearables all together, particularly for animals raised indoors. Using cameras stationed throughout the barn, the software alerts farmers when their cows show early signs of lameness. Cargill has a significant minority investment in Cainthus, capitalizing on the notion that this “machine vision” approach will allow AI to supplant many of the sensor systems. Developed by Connecterra, Ida, “The Intelligent Dairy Farmer’s Assistant,” is a cow neck tag that gathers activity data on cows, such as time spent eating, ruminating, idling, walking and lying down. Connecterra says it uses AI to interpret individual deviations in the cow’s behavior and provide alerts or recommendations to the farmer. Drones There are opportunities for drones in the dairy industry, but they often require additional technologies. Drones can be used to generally inspect the herd or fences or to aid in herding cows from fields to barns. The inclusion of other technologies presents greater opportunities. Visual sensors have proven to be instrumental in surveying land and measuring pasture growth. PrecisionHawk is using drones to map, inspect and photograph pastures in order to detect growth. Algorithms enable drones to identify cows specifically and avoid confusing them with deer or similar animals. When combined with thermal imaging, the opportunities to locate and track cows increases dramatically, particularly in fields spotted with trees or dense foliage. Temperature detection would allow farmers to identify abnormal behavior in the cow, such as lameness, illness or calving. Drones may become more useful in these areas, particularly if battery life is prolonged and autonomous flying ability is improved. Robots Robotic milking machines are probably the most well-known application for robots in the dairy industry, increasing efficiencies and replacing expensive or unavailable labor. Lely’s Astronaut A5 and DeLaval’s Voluntary Milking System not only cut labor costs, they also allow cows to decide when they want to be milked. Robotic milkers (milkbots) clean the udders, identify the cow’s teats and milk automatically. DeLaval offers other robotic milking technologies, such as the rotary platform, which allows farmers to maximize a herd’s milking performance while providing a comfortable and safe environment for both cows and operators. miRobot provides a milking system also designed for larger operations. Both companies offer multi-stall, automated milking operations to milk cows simultaneously, completing full parlors with only one operator. This new technology has allowed farmers to cut back on labor costs and achieve more milkings per day. ​ Image courtesy of Lely The Lely Grazeway system acts as a gateway to the pasture that only allows cows to graze after they have been milked. The cows step into the selection box, and the Lely Qwes cow-recognition system determines whether or not the cow can be let out to graze. Before robots, cows were typically milked twice a day because of labor and time constraints. Now, cows can be milked three times a day or more, greatly increasing production and profits. In addition, while the cows are stationary for several minutes during milking, there is also an opportunity for medical and health assessments using transponders or sensors — which can not only analyze the speed, amount and quality of milk produced but also how much the cow has eaten, its heat cycle and more. Another possible use for robots includes cleaning and sanitizing the barn, allowing for better biosecurity measures that will lead to healthier conditions for the cows. There might also be a place for robots in the calving process. While this might not be as useful for an outdoor herd, there is the potential for robotic assistance for cows kept indoors. 3D printing There are multitudinous applications for 3D printing in the dairy industry. A primary application of 3D printing is for machine parts, which may be of particular interest to rural farmers, saving valuable time and even possibly money, depending on the part needed. ​ Image courtesy of Perfect Day In some ways, 3D printing is already challenging the dairy industry, through 3D-printed foods. Cheese is one of the easier foods to duplicate through 3D printing, due to its easily changeable state from solid to liquid. Studies suggest that printed cheese is less sticky, softer and has better meltability than non-printed cheese. The concept of printed food may not appeal to all consumers, though, so the challenge is to produce food that offers an advantage, such as lower cost, improved taste or better nutritional content. Such is the case with “Perfect Day,” a startup company from San Francisco using 3D printing combined with gene sequencing to create a yeast fermentation product that looks and tastes like milk. The product is portrayed as a non-dairy alternative for vegans or dairy-intolerant individuals. Augmented reality Augmented reality (AR) can be defined as the integration of digital information with the user’s environment in real time. A recent report stated that sales for augmented reality are expected to rise from $2.4 billion in 2018 to $48.2 billion in 2025. Studies have found that AR can be used to make food more visually appealing or to effectively estimate proper serving sizes. Apple’s ARKit can also be used to provide consumers with nutritional knowledge, as this video demonstrates. Should this technology become more common, these applications could affect the dairy industry, as certain aspects of food products — both good and bad — would be more readily available to the consumer. Outside of the consumer focus, augmented reality can be used to allow producers an alternative way to monitor and evaluate cows. This video (skip to the 2:22 mark) demonstrates how AR can allow a farmer to immediately see stats relating to the farm through the use of goggles. Information relating to each individual cow is overlaid through the glasses into the farmer’s field of vision. He can see information on everything in the facility and even evaluate the quality of the milk. Could this technology not also be used in the veterinary field for inspection and observation? Perhaps if combined with reliable sensor data, the vet could be able to deliver appropriate recommendations for disease management and reduce the need for direct farm call visits, thus lowering costs. Virtual reality Virtual reality (VR) is defined as a digital environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real way through electronic equipment. Applications in the dairy industry vary from farm tours to veterinary training, with positive impacts on safety and efficiency. New Zealand dairy cooperative Fonterra and solutions company Beca have partnered to develop a virtual reality health and safety training technology that allows employees to navigate the manufacturing and distribution sites without actually setting foot on the physical site, thus reducing onboarding times. Fonterra employees learn to identify potential hazards and experience hazardous situations in a realistic simulated environment, enhancing learning experiences without the risk of being in harm’s way. This technology also reduces labor costs by replacing a number of hands-on health and safety training positions. Virtual reality is being used to teach veterinary students about the reproductive and rectal tracts of the cow. Created by former vet Sarah Baillie, the Haptic Cow is a fiberglass model of the rear of a cow that combines virtual reality with robotics. The VR aspect is provided by a computer that allows students to visualize an object within the cow — virtually enabling them to practice fertility examinations, such as pregnancy detection, or determine reproductive concerns without putting them in a situation that could be dangerous for both the cow and the student. DeLaval is creating virtual reality films of farms available in 360 degrees, allowing viewers to scroll from side to side to view the entirety of the dairy barn. The Hamra Farm in Sweden, for instance, showcases the innovative techniques they implement on their farm, such as robotic milking machines, robotic brushes, robotic cleaners and more, in their VR film. These \"farm tours\" will allow consumers to better understand where their dairy comes from. There is much discussion about animal welfare, and giving consumers an opportunity to experience firsthand how a dairy farm operates is an important component of influencing perception the industry. Blockchain It is well known that consumers are increasingly becoming interested in where their food comes from and how it is produced. Blockchain can connect all aspects of the supply chain from producer to consumer and allow for food traceability and safety. From an agriculture and food perspective, offering this type of information to consumers will become a competitive advantage and may not prove as challenging in dairy as in other areas of agriculture, such as beef, which exchanges ownership more frequently. Internet of Things Together these eight technologies are creating opportunities within the dairy industry for increased efficiencies, profitability and production. The connectivity of these technologies is made possible through the Internet of Things (IoT). Agriwebb is a company using IoT for full farm recordkeeping, including field management, inventory, operations, grazing and even biosecurity. Stellapps in India leverages IoT to offer all manner of products, from general herd management to milk evaluation, payment processing and cold chain monitoring. Dell Technologies is also heavily involved in IoT applications and is working with dairy producer Chitale. Cargill is working with SCiO (Consumer Physics) to create Reveal, an app designed to deliver content of feed within minutes. Previously, this type of technology was either time-intensive (waiting on lab results) or expensive (specialized equipment cost thousands of dollars). Using a micro spectrometer with NIR calibrations, Cargill and SCiO offer this simple service using producers' own devices, and results are available in a minute's time. ​ IoT technology is how the KEENAN InTouch system is able to provide farmers with the nutritional information they need to ensure the best formulation possible. KEENAN’s feed mixers are designed to give uniformity to feed, allowing for improved digestion in the ruminant and creating rations that are both chemically and physically balanced. The cloud-based system enables producers to monitor feed waste and make necessary changes to improve efficiencies and decrease costs. Using the data In the past, farm management applications have allowed farmers to make strategic management decisions based on the collection of farm data. Inevitably once nutritional decisions are being made, sciences such as nutrigenomics and decisions about smart nutrition are critical to taking advantage of this enhanced data and management information systems. Nutrigenomics research has shown that specific nutrients and inclusion of enzymes can greatly impact milk yield. Previously, collected data was generalized for an entire dairy farm. Through the use of sensors, AI and other technologies, farm management apps like FarmWizard can provide individual data for each cow, allowing farmers to improve precision and accuracy when making managerial decisions. ​ Dairying in 2067 won’t look anything like the dairy farming of the recent past, let alone the era when the first cow was domesticated. Changes are happening so fast that the connected farm is likely to be the norm within the next 10 years. By implementing the eight technologies described here, along with the interconnectivity of IoT, farmers will be able to capture and have direct access to individual cow data, both current and historical. This will enable farmers to bridge the data gap and improve dairy production through digitization. The winners will be those who embrace this disrupted digital dairy landscape.

While agriculture is being forced to compete with sprawling urban settlements for land and water, it will also be required to serve on other major fronts: adapting to and contributing to the mitigation of climate change, helping preserve natural habitats and maintaining a high level of biodiversity while continuing to feed the world. New and traditional demands continue to grow for agricultural products, thus putting pressure on an already scarce resource. As our global population is expected to reach 9 billion by 2050, the question must be asked: How can we feed the world with a finite amount of land? In order to visualize the world in 2050, Alltech created a virtual experience entitled ONE Vision. ONE Vision will allow attendees to experience a planet of plenty, where technology and science align in order to produce nutritious food. Attendees will be guided through a 10,000-square-foot virtual planet, where they can witness a world in harmony with its three essential elements: land, air and water. Attendees will also find themselves in sub-Saharan Africa, where advanced soil management solutions have tripled crop production, and in Asia’s paddy fields, where upland planting is producing sustainable harvests in flood-prone areas. Across the globe, the farms of the future are thriving as their animals achieve their genetic potential, producing more with less, all while reversing soil degradation and reducing water use, waste and emissions. Attendees can also interact with reaction tables, allowing them to understand the effects of today’s choices on the agriculture industry and future of our planet. By drawing back the curtain on the future and allowing attendees to glimpse what’s possible, Alltech hopes to encourage individuals to make the right choices today for their future tomorrow and thereafter.

In many ways, the newest tech gadgets can also be advantageous for our pets — but do they have any downsides? In humans, for example, too much time spent engaged with our phones can be detrimental to our mental and physical health. So, is there such a thing as too much technology for our pets? In order to live their best lives, pets only require the right nutrition, care, exercise and attention. While technology will never replace a cat curled up in her owner’s lap or a devoted canine companion lying at his owner’s feet, it can simplify life with pets in several ways. Nutrition: An estimated 60% of cats and 56% of dogs in the U.S. are overweight or obese. As such, a tech tool for weight management can be a real life-changer for chubby pets. Smart feeders and smart scales can help with portion control. Smart feeders for multi-pet families ensure that each pet is given the right amount of food and can also help cut down on fights over the dinner bowl. Smart water bowls encourage drinking and are a simple way to monitor whether or not pets with medical conditions are drinking enough. Veterinary care: Apps can help connect pet parents with vets and other healthcare providers. Visits to the veterinary clinic can be both stressful and inconvenient, but a virtual visit or text chat with a vet can eliminate some of those issues. At-home doggy DNA tests can unravel the mystery of a mixed-breed dog’s genetic makeup, allowing owners to learn more about the potential health issues linked to their pet’s breed and background. Microbiome test kits identify the type of microorganisms living in our pet’s digestive tract, giving us further insight into their health, immunity and behavior. Exercise: GPS devices and step trackers can tell us just how active our pets have been during the day. Are they couch potatoes, or are they running laps around the living room? This data can help us determine whether a 30-minute walk will be enough to wear out our pup at the end of the day or if we will need to spend more time at the dog park. This technology can also help us locate our pets if they decide to go on an unapproved solo adventure. Cameras: Who doesn’t want to see what their pets get up to when they’re left at home alone? Whether it’s separation anxiety — in the pet or the human — or a burning desire to help your fur-baby become the next viral video star, smart cameras give us a peek at what our pets do when we’re not around. They can also help keep our pets safe in the event of a fire or break-in. And who knows? You may even catch them doing a little counter-surfing — in which case, you can offer them a quick scolding via video chat. Pet technology certainly has its advantages: smart cameras help keep both our pets and our homes safe, walking around the block in order to earn a badge on an app is still exercise, and texting with your vet can provide peace of mind. Ultimately, however, we should remember that pets are pretty low-tech; their biggest desire is usually just the pleasure of our company. Technology will only continue to improve and make our lives easier — for example, autonomous robots designed to automatically scoop dog poop are currently in the works. This begs the question, though: Will we eventually be plagued with too much data from our pets? All we know right now is that this is a possibility. In the end, owners will be best-served to remember that an app, a smart bowl or several hours of livestream video will never replace what we love most about our pets and the joy we feel in caring for them. I would like to receive more information related to pet care.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/pet-technology-totally-amazing-or-too-much","title":"\n\n                    Pet technology: Totally amazing or too much?\n                    ","date":"August 14, 2019","contentLength":691}},{"pageContent":"With the 2016 Central Plains Dairy Expo kicking off this week in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, we are gearing up for a unique educational experience. Dr. Roger Scaletti, Alltech North America Mineral Management team technical sales and support, and Tom Lorenzen, Alltech on-farm specialist, will be teaming up for an udder health workshop, helping producers take an inside look at udder health and milk quality. Scaletti and Lorenzen plan to give producers four key practical approaches to managing udder health and combating mastitis: Environment The environment that your cattle are housed in can play a major role in poor milk quality. Are your cows housed in a mastitis-infected yard, or are they in a well-ventilated dry area, with minimal contact to some of the key mastitis-causing bacteria? While udder health management is important in preventing cases of mastitis, it is also important to understand how the disease travels through the udder. According to Scaletti, it’s a process beginning with the bacteria first entering the gland, multiplying, evading host defenses and finally damaging the host. Cases of mastitis can be both clinical or subclinical and contagious or environmental. Know your enemy “If you cannot measure it, you cannot control it. If you cannot control it, you cannot manage it.” These words of advice from Lorenzen ring true. Whether culturing quarters individually or utilizing a California Mastitis Test (CMT), getting an understanding of what bacteria or what quarters you are dealing with is key. To find out what type of mastitis cows are infected with, Scaletti suggests culturing milk or using a DNA test. This quick test, which only takes four hours, can examine the bulk tank or individual cows, and producers can use the same sample as collected for somatic cell count (SCC). The test can be customized to report only contagious pathogens, or you can request the full panel of pathogens that can be detected. Running a culture on infected quarters can be beneficial in understanding what specific bacteria you are fighting, and what specific treatment to which that particular bacteria will respond. Feeding program Nutrition and the use of organic trace minerals can play a key role in milk quality as well as managing infections before they even occur. Nutrition has been linked to improving immune function and reducing mastitis. Selenium for strong antioxidant phagocytic cells, zinc for the integrity of skin and copper for neutrophil production and antibody development are a few of the more important trace minerals involved in immune function. Alltech has committed over 30 years to research in mineral nutrition as well as formulating technologies that meet herds’ needs while safeguarding them from potential risks. Minerals: Form vs. function While some might argue for more inorganic minerals in the ration, Scaletti said it is important to consider bioavailability, mineral interactions and environmental concerns. A trace mineral chelated to amino acids or peptides offers higher bioavailability and supports the animal’s natural defense system. In addition to organic mineral research, Scaletti also highlighted the importance of keeping the cow’s selenium status in check. In one recent Florida study, researchers found cows fed organic selenium had 100,000+ lower SCC than those fed sodium selenite.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/four-practical-approaches-managing-udder-health-combating-mastitis","title":"\n\n                    Four practical approaches to managing udder health, combating mastitis\n                    ","date":"March 28, 2016","contentLength":534}},{"pageContent":"When Dr. Pearse Lyons, founder and president of Alltech, took to the stage at the company’s annual symposium, ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference, his one question to the 3,000 gathered delegates was: “What is your ONE big idea?” “Turn on your lamp,” he said, to light the paths ahead on your journey of discovery. He reflected that his own personal journey began on Gold Rush Road, Lexington, Kentucky, USA, and that journey has taken him to meet some of the world’s most amazing people, such as Muhammad Ali and Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom. His inspirational, entrepreneurial journey started with $10,000 and a question from his mother: “What took you so long?” Dr. Lyons recognized that there were many other “lamps” that lit the path on his journey to creating a now $2 billion company. Bringing his team along on this journey was important, he noted, and at ONE, Dr. Lyons shared the following insights: Find what you love, what makes your heart sing Welcome opportunity Make your one choice Dr. Lyons stressed that choices change lives, not chances. Take the decision to go down that corridor. If you don’t go down that corridor, how can you expect doors to open to you? “I’d like to help you to open those doors,” said Dr. Lyons at the ONE opening plenary session. “If we share our ideas with others, we can all conspire to help to make those ideas come to pass.” Opportunities are everywhere, yet those opportunities are fleeting; in fact, Dr. Lyons believes you have to grab those opportunities within a 24-hour period. He posed the question: “Where do ideas come from?” In looking for those new ideas, always look for the catch — what’s the catch? Then, find the solution. Where to look for ideas: Travel Create Build an innovation incubator Be ready Search for the catch and overcome it Turn setbacks into bounce-backs Entrepreneurs are sales people; they always find the solution. Steve Jobs and Henry Ford were sellers, Dr. Lyons said. They sold dreams, dreams of communications and of transportation. He advises entrepreneurs to march right when the rest of the world marches left. In going that different route, you go down the road less traveled.

During times of low milk prices, understanding your costs can be crucial to a farm, effectively riding the wave to the next high or low in the milk price storm. Understanding IOFC IOFC is defined as the portion of income from milk sold that remains after paying for purchased and farm-raised feed used to produce the milk. Information you need to calculate IOFC: Milk price average per month Total milk produced per day over the period of a month Number of cows as it relates to production during that month Inputs (amount of feed used) Cost per ton of feed input (to purchase or produce) To illustrate with an example, we will use a 142-cow milking Holstein herd in Kentucky. Income Milk price: $15.50 Number of cows: 142 Average pounds produced per cow per day: 78 pounds Income per cow per day: $15.50 * .78 = $12.09 Feed costs: Ingredient Cost per ton Cost per lb Inclusion in Diet (lbs) Cost in Diet Corn Silage 40 0.02 60 $1.20 Balage 60 0.03 10 $0.30 Fine Ground Corn 175 0.09 11.5 $1.01 Soybean Meal 445 0.22 6.5 $1.45 Citrus 195 0.10 3.5 $0.34 Concentrate 495 0.25 5 $1.24 Total $5.53 IOFC = $12.09 (income) - $5.53 (feed costs) = $6.56 per cow per day Feed to succeed When evaluating your ration to maximize IOFC, there are potential changes that carry minimal to no cost but can have an impact on your bottom line. Slow release non-protein nitrogen provides a concentrated source of ruminally-degradable protein. Due to the concentrated nature of the protein, a small amount provides the same nutrients as a larger amount of vegetable protein, allowing for reformulation potential to reduce feed costs. Optigen®, a product from Alltech, was utilized by Penn State in an example of IOFC calculation. You can read more here: http://www.dairyherd.com/news/industry/production-financials-cash-flow-mechanics. Yeast: Feeding yeast has been widely researched and has shown to improve dry matter intake, stabilize rumen pH, maximize nutrient release and reduce overall feed costs. Enzymes: Looking at the use of enzyme technology can be another avenue to maximize IOFC. When feeding high-forage or high-corn diets, adding an enzyme that helps break down the key components in these diets, such as starch or plant fiber, can increase feed efficiency and improve milk production. Using tools such as IOFC can lead to opportunities to gain a better understanding of your ration, to improve profitability of your herd and to understand your spending power when it comes to other on-farm purchases.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/calculate-and-improve-your-dairys-income-over-feed-cost-metrics","title":"\n\n                    Calculate and improve your dairy’s income over feed cost metrics\n                    ","date":"June 2, 2016","contentLength":475}},{"pageContent":"As China’s middle class continues to grow and to migrate to urban areas, it is demanding healthier, safer and more nutritious food.

Which crop science products will help serve this market? Dr. Kai: Alltech Crop Science China has worked to gain product approval for two of the company’s natural plant and soil activators. The company is now finalizing registration of its unique products, designed to streamline processes for optimal performance and help revitalize soils. The excellent results from the registration and demonstration trials conducted thus far make us extremely excited about the future of this technology in China and the role Alltech can play to support the development of new agricultural practices in this country. How is Alltech supporting other efforts in China? Dr. Lyons: Alltech’s China Now program is a strategic five-year plan and includes numerous educational and research initiatives in China. The company has been operating in China for 22 years and has recently partnered with Nestlé in the creation of a world-class training center, the Dairy Farming Institute in Shuangcheng, Heilongjiang province. In addition, 10 of the company’s 30 research alliances are focused on providing local support for this growing region. What are future challenges and opportunities in China? Dr. Borst: As Chinese producers work on continued production efficiency, they are also awakening to the same issues we are successfully addressing in the U.S. and Brazil. Common issues include addressing nutrient management needs not only for soil health, but as part of integrated crop and livestock systems. Across the globe, farmers are working to become more precise with nutrient management. With our global expertise, we can share best practices with producers and others involved in Chinese agribusiness. Consumers and producers alike are demanding more natural alternatives and products that fit into sustainable management systems. We are focused on providing new solutions that meet environmental sustainability and food safety standards.

What we know Two dogs and one cat have been infected with COVID-19, but according to the CDC, WHO and AMVA, there is no evidence at this point that pets can spread COVID-19 to other animals or people. A 17-year-old Pomeranian in Hong Kong had several “weak positive” tests from nasal and oral swabs following its owner’s positive test. Unfortunately, the dog was already dealing with ongoing health issues and has passed away. A second dog was under quarantine and had consistently negative results for the virus. Neither dog had any respiratory symptoms. A 2-year-old German Shepherd, also in Hong Kong, has tested positive for COVID-19, as did the dog’s owner. Another mixed-breed dog in the household has tested negative. Both dogs are currently in quarantine, and neither dog has experienced any respiratory symptoms. A cat in Belgium has tested positive for COVID-19 after her owner’s positive test. The cat had digestive and respiratory issues but recovered nine days after her symptoms manifested. As a precaution, if you are ill with COVID-19, the CDC recommends that you limit contact with animals until more is known about the virus. They recommend, if possible, that you have someone else care for your pet while you are sick. If you must care for your pet while sick, wash your hands before and after interacting with them. What can we do? 1. Have at least 2 weeks’ worth of pet food on hand Pet food companies and suppliers are working hard to make sure food will be available in-store and online. Refill any medications and keep a supply of supplements on hand to limit interactions at the pet store or vet clinic. 2. Pet stores and vet clinics are considered essential business They are adapting to keep you safe with curbside pickup and delivery options. Pet food and supplies will be available thanks to those businesses — let them know they are appreciated. 3. Have a plan Identify an emergency caregiver and create a list that includes your veterinarian’s contact information and your pets’ allergies, medications, favorite treats and daily habits. 4. Maintain your daily exercise routine Exercise and fresh air may help relieve some stress for both you and your pet. Wash your hands before and after playing with your pet or cleaning up their feces. Keep their food and water bowls, bedding and toys clean. 5. Remember pets in need at shelters Consider donating food, bedding or cleaning supplies. If you can do so safely, walk, foster or adopt a pet. Some shelters are temporarily closing to limit interactions, so bringing home a foster pet could be a great addition to your family during this time. As we adjust to the new normal, check in — from a safe distance, of course — on your neighbors both with and without pets. Social distancing may keep us apart physically, but connection with the beings we love — whether they have four legs or two — will keep us all healthier and happier. We’re all in this together.

Each species of fish or shrimp requires a nutritionally balanced aquaculture feed that is tailored for each specific stage in their development. Providing nutritional solutions for the particular needs of larvae — their most critical life stage — benefits the fish during their entire lifecycle. An ideal start begins with optimal nutrition that supports the healthy development of all organs. Not meeting these nutritional requirements can potentially lead to deficiencies and deformities, such as poor growth and increased mortality, and, ultimately, result in decreased producer profitability. Advantages of using a high-quality, nutritionally balanced aquafeed: Minimal nutritional deficiencies Optimal development and foundation for future growth High digestibility for optimal performance and water quality Creating an optimal fish ecosystem In fish farming environments, some variables can affect production, including temperature, oxygen, ammonia levels and water quality. Modern recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) give greater control over these factors. The same can be said for aquafeed production; the quality of raw materials, nutritional formulations, transportation, performance, climate and feed mill operation can all impact the performance and productivity on-farm. Fish will perform best when an optimal environment is maintained; aquafeed and aquaculture supplements play a critical role in this. Creating an optimal environment relies heavily on water quality. It is crucial for maximum growth, health and survival throughout the production cycle. Ingredient quality and nutrient availability aids digestion and nutrient absorption and utilization, resulting in healthier fish, but also lower feces production and less pollution in the systems and the environment. Getting the foundations right as early as possible helps fish reach their maximum potential. Maintaining water quality Maintaining water quality is largely connected with the quality of aquafeed. Any uneaten or undigested feed that is excreted into their environment is not only wasted but also causes unnecessary pollution and additional, unnecessary stress. For this reason, the feed must be highly palatable and suitable for the correct species and their developmental stage. Not meeting these needs from the start can have adverse effects on fish health. Recent research completed at the Alltech Coppens Aqua Centre displayed the improvements in growth and performance when feeding two of Alltech Coppens’ starter feeds to rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) during the hatchery phase. The results of this benchmark trial are shown in Figure 1. Figure 1. Results of a starter feed benchmark trial performed in the Alltech Coppens Aqua Centre. Supporting internal defense systems A fish’s skin, gut and gills are the primary points of interaction with the external environmental factors that can impact on their health. Both internally and externally, these organs must be protected. Included in all Alltech Coppens feed is a premix known as Aquate®. Aquate has been specially formulated to meet the specific requirements of each aquatic species and life stage. It encourages healthier and more robust populations and boosts natural defense systems, aiding gut function. The best farm results are seen when feeds containing the Aquate package are fed throughout the entire life of the fish, as this feeding strategy creates continuity in the supply of their nutritional requirements. Advantages of sustainable aquaculture We live in a rapidly changing environment, with pressure on nature, wild fish stocks and food security. This should not be underestimated; we have an obligation to produce sustainable, well-balanced animal protein responsibly. This is a commitment that we take very seriously in Alltech. A key element in producing sustainable fish and seafood is the reduction of fishmeal and fish oil in feed production. When reducing these key ingredients, close attention must be paid to the nutritional balance of the feed to ensure it meets the essential nutrient and energy requirements of farmed species. The cost of aquafeed in aquaculture is the single highest operational cost for a producer in the industry. Any small change can have a significant impact on profit yield. It is necessary to look at the nutritional profile and quality of raw materials to find a balanced feed for each farm. Innovative research in the Alltech Coppens Aqua Centre has led to lowering our carbon footprint, lowering phosphorus and nitrogen emissions and a low inclusion of fishmeal and fish oil in feed formulations with no impact on the growth and performance on-farm.

While the more moderate weather can often feel like a welcome relief — especially after a long, cold winter — this aptly monikered “mud season” can wreak havoc on a horse’s skin and coat. Conditions like rain rot, scratches, sweet itch and hives are more than just unsightly and uncomfortable — they can also have a significant impact on your riding and training time. Of course, we all know that horses are naturally sensitive beings and that skin problems are never 100% avoidable. Attention to proper grooming, nutrition, supplements and veterinary care can make a big difference, but we should all be prepared to recognize and treat these issues when they manifest. Let’s explore four of the most common ailments, as well as some recommended treatments and steps you can take to help keep them at bay. Rain rot in horses What causes it? As the common nickname for this pesky dermatological disease implies, rain rot is brought on by a combination of moisture and the presence of a bacterium called Dermatophilus congolensis. Every horse is susceptible to this condition, which is generally associated with warm, wet weather. Broken skin, either from bug bites or cuts, allows the bacteria in. Excess moisture also plays a significant role because it strips the skin of natural oils that otherwise serve as protection from bacteria. How do I identify it? If your horse has rain rot, you’ll notice scab-like bumps, particularly along the top of the head, neck, back and/or croup. When pulled, the hair will easily come away from the body, leaving behind an infected, hairless spot of skin. These lesions are commonly itchy or painful. Is it contagious? Yes, rain rot can easily spread from one horse to another. As such, it’s important to not share brushes, blankets or tack, and to make sure these items are regularly cleaned. How do I treat it? While often mistaken for a fungal disease like ringworm — which is, thankfully, far less common — this bacterial condition will not be affected by antifungal medication. Bathing the horse with an antibacterial shampoo, removing the scabs once they have softened and following up with a topical antibacterial treatment can prove effective. How do I prevent it? Groom your animals daily and clean your brushes often. You should also take several environmental factors into consideration. Shelters are great in theory, but how many times have you witnessed a horse standing outside of a shelter during inclement weather? As horse owners know, equines are sadly not always concerned about self-preservation! If it’s raining, provide a protective waterproof sheet (which must also be regularly cleaned, especially if your horse is symptomatic) or leave your horse in a stall for the day instead. Scratches in horses What causes it? Also known as mud fever or pastern dermatitis, this condition is often produced by a mixture of bacteria that commonly includes Dermatophilus congolensis, Staphylococcus spp and/or fungal organisms known as dermatophytes. It may also be caused by parasites. These organisms find their way into breaks or openings on the horse’s skin, and the prime conditions during which they are likely to appear include consistent exposure to an excessively moist or dirty environment. As with rain rot, every horse is susceptible to scratches; however, those with feathers or long fetlock hair that retains moisture seem to be particularly vulnerable. Horses with white legs may also be more at risk, since unpigmented skin is more susceptible to sun damage, chafing and abrasions. How do I identify it? Early symptoms often include swollen skin and small, scab-like bumps. If allowed to progress, you’ll notice scabby crusts forming on the back of the pastern, which often appear in a line that looks like — you guessed it — a scratch. Although scratches most often impact the hind legs, horses may get it on their front legs as well. Is it contagious? Yes, this is also an easily transmissible disorder. Do not share boots or grooming supplies, and practice good hand hygiene, especially after coming into contact with the infected area. How do I treat it? Carefully clip the hair away from the affected area and gently wash it with an antibacterial or antifungal shampoo. Begin by doing this once daily for the first 7–10 days and cut back to two or three times per week until the issue is remedied. Let the shampoo sit for approximately 10 minutes before rinsing. Scabs can be massaged off gently, but you should not pull or pick at them. Carefully pat the area dry with a clean towel before applying a topical antibiotic or antifungal treatment. Keep your horse housed in a clean, dry environment. How do I prevent it? Keep footing as dry as possible, and get into the habit of drying your horse’s legs before you put them into their stall. Don’t share boots or wraps, and, if possible, keep feathers closely trimmed. Sweet itch in horses What causes it? Also known as summer itch, this seasonal recurrent dermatitis is typically caused by an allergic reaction to Culicoides, a genus of biting midges. You may commonly hear these pests referred to as “no-see-ums” or gnats. Horses may also experience insect hypersensitivity in response to biting flies. This hypersensitivity is considered the most common allergy in horses and is a typical reason for itchy skin. How do I identify it? Horses with sweet itch often become very itchy in the spring and may rub out their mane and tail hair. You may also notice skin irritation or lesions along the topline, jaw, axillary regions and ventral midline. Is it contagious? No, but other horses on the property may also be susceptible to the negative effects of these biting insects. How do I treat it? Antihistamines, topical creams and insect repellents may be effective options and should be tried first before resorting to more serious measures, such as corticosteroid injections, which can have serious long-term side effects with prolonged use. How do I prevent it? Remove manure regularly and keep standing water in check. Use stall fans and fly gear, such as masks and boots, and keep in mind that “no-see-ums” prefer to begin feeding at dusk and overnight, so keep at-risk horses inside during these times. Hives in horses What causes them? Many things can cause hives, including insect bites, pollens, food allergies, medications or direct contact with a variety of materials. How do I identify them? Also known as urticaria, hives are fluid-filled, raised swellings on a horse’s skin. Generally round in shape, these bumps may range in size from 0.5 to 8 inches wide. They may or may not be itchy and can develop anywhere on a horse’s body, though they most commonly appear on the neck, back, flank or leg area. Are they contagious? No, hives are not transmissible. How do I treat them? Fortunately, hives rarely impact the general health of a horse and often resolve on their own within 24–48 hours. In these cases, treatment is unnecessary. However, in more severe cases, you may wish to consult with your veterinarian on treatment options, such as antihistamines, epinephrine or corticosteroids. How do I prevent them? It can be difficult to determine the root cause of hives, but avoidance or the elimination of triggering factors can play a key role in keeping them from reoccurring in the future. This may involve some trial and error, but suggested steps include changing paddocks and bedding and eliminating supplements one at a time to determine whether they may have been a culprit in causing this allergic reaction.

The following is a transcript of the podcast. Alltech and Masterfeeds have been partners for many years, can you tell us when and how this relationship started? LYONS Well, you know Canada has always been one of Alltech’s great marketplaces. When I first came to the United States, it was to Canada that I came first, and I will always remember going to Canada in February, which is not a good idea for some of you setting foot in North America for the first time. I began to understand why people get into their house as fast as they could. So, almost hibernate for the winter. But, as I traveled across the west, a real warmth towards Alltech, or what was the beginning of Alltech, so, somehow it was almost like a déjà vu. We go back to the ‘80s, we go back to meeting at different feed meetings like the Guelph Nutrition Conference, like the nutrition conferences, which were held out in places like Calgary and even indeed up into Montreal. This is a relationship that goes deep, a long, long relationship. FLACK Well, I guess it would be that I met Dr. Lyons years ago. And, Pearse, if you don’t mind I’ll tell the story about when I came down to the Kentucky for the Kentucky Derby with Alltech and at the time I believe your right hand man, Dr. Lyons, Bill Cheek. LYONS Yes, good ol’ Bill Cheek, I have his picture right here on my desk. FLACK And, we had our dinner with a group setting, with people from all over the world. And, when the dinner was done, we had a sing-song and a laugh and some good cheer and pictures were being taken, and a picture was taken with me, I assumed, of me and my wife Denise, and some others, and I got home and as I was sitting at my desk, a letter came in from Bill Cheek who had wrote a nice note thanking us for coming down to the Kentucky Derby: We enjoyed hosting you and lovely picture of you here with your bride-to-be Denise. I looked at the picture and lo and behold it wasn’t my bride-to-be at all. It was another woman altogether, and so I wrote him a beautiful tongue-in-cheek response saying, I’m in deep trouble, this is not my wife at all and she’s read this and seen this and I am in deep trouble. And, he took it seriously, unfortunately, but sent me the most beautiful picture of a Kentucky morning turnout and, I believe, your wife, Mrs. Lyons, had this framed. To this day, we have this hanging in our house so we can’t not think of Alltech when we look at this picture. So, it was some fun beginnings and that was close to 25 years ago. And, the other big experience was partnering with Alltech in the 2010 Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games in Kentucky, and we had some fun for sure doing this. What makes this acquisition a positive move for both companies? LYONS Well, you know, it’s not an acquisition, it’s a coming together of like-minded people. It’s not an acquisition, it’s a coming together of friends. I will quote what one of our people said this morning; they said “so far this is one of the easiest mergers coming together that we have had” and we have done, like, 10 of these so far. This one was just dead easy. And, what makes it positive for both companies is the synergies that can occur. What makes it positive for both companies is that we can bring to the farmer, the Canadian farmer, the technology that we have and what Masterfeeds can bring to us is their technologies. And, since we are a company in 128 countries, and Canadians are great, great travelers and are very well-accepted across the world, we see the nutrition that Canada has as being of great use to people in China, to people in South America. It’s not 1 + 1 = 2. It’s 1 + 1 = 3 or even 4. FLACK And to add to that, the word I would use, is what we are seeing and why it’s so positive, is that we are seeing a lot of cross-pollination between all the Alltech divisions, whether it’s shared technology, their experiences across the world. And, I can say that I’ve done a lot of deals, and this has been the most exciting deal and change that I have seen internally in our 86-year history, not that I have been around for 86 years, but for the last 35 years plus, and this is absolutely one of the most exciting ownership changes we have ever been through. LYONS And, I will add to that. It’s not just an ownership change. They are joining a family business; they are joining a business that is not for sale, namely Alltech. They are joining a business that will not go public. So, it’s a win-win. It’s a win for the people out there, the Masterfeeds people. It’s a win for the Alltech people and when you know you’re not for sale, and when you know you’re not going to be flipped, and so forth, then it just makes for a very comfortable situation. I am surprised that we didn’t do it before. Well, now that the deal has closed and we begin the integration process, what opportunities do you expect to see emerge? LYONS Well, I can only tell you what has happened in some of the other deals that we have done. First of all, we expect to see a nice improvement in the profitability of Masterfeeds, Masterfeeds themselves. We expect to see some of that coming from synergy, we expect to see some of that coming from things they learn from us and vice versa, so there will be an improvement in profitability. Then equally the ability for us to get our technology out to the farmer through Masterfeeds. We are so excited. The guys came into me this morning and they said, some of our people said, wow, we have just been into the analytical services laboratory that they have up there and they do so many hundreds of samples and so on. This was our crop science people. Oh, and we believe we can bring more samples, and we believe we can do this and we believe we can do that, and so on. You know the benefits for us, the benefits for the Canadian farmer, and the benefits for the U.S. farmer, I don’t think we really realize just how great they’re going to be. FLACK What amazed me since we started our discussions really, Dr. Lyons, back in April, and as I obviously become more involved inside your company is the diversity and so much of that diversity can be incorporated within both our products and programs and it’s not only products and programs, but it’s the cultural diversity, the enthusiasm, the big picture thinking that truly is infectious, whether it’s animal nutrition innovation, that’s a given. I think that synergy is going to complement both of us. Crop science applications as you just mentioned. We are growing significantly in that area in terms of sampling and soil application working with crop science companies. New algae products. Everyone who has been down and toured that algae facility, including me, the new products on the horizon are simply, it’s just exciting, and blows your mind in terms of the applications going forward, all of these represent new opportunities for Masterfeeds and quite frankly new opportunities for our customers, and we’re excited about taking them to the farm gate. So, we touched a little bit on the benefits that Canadian farmers and ranchers will see, can we get a little more specific on that? LYONS Yes, you know, to me, farmers, I don’t care whether they be Hutterite farmers or whether they be corn growers, or whether they be pig farmers, farmers are born entrepreneurs. Farmers always ask you one question—what’s new, what’s new, what’s new—and that’s what they want to do. They want to try things, and I think what’s going to happen now with the Canadian farmers in particular, since that is where we are, right above Canada now. They are going to get the benefits of our experience from 128 countries. We are going to hopefully bring, some of them, to 128 countries. And, if there is an opportunity in Manitoba or an opportunity in Ontario, or if there is a challenge in Manitoba or a challenge in Ontario, we can immediately go to his friends, and Alltech is a company of friends, and he can go to his friends in 128 countries and say this is what we’ve got. Could it benefit you? Or, this is what we’ve got, do you have anything that could benefit us? It’s all about communication. It’s about two or three things: We have to have size. You can’t be too big, but you have to have size. With Masterfeeds, we have size. The second thing is you have to have innovation. I am in love with innovation. I love the challenges, I love to be able to go into our laboratories and challenge the guys to do this, this and this, and that’s the innovation part. Speed - You know, Rob, when they place an order, they don’t expect the order to come in three weeks, they expect the order to come in three hours. So speed, speed, speed. So with Masterfeeds we have size. Do you realize we are the number one feed company now in Canada? Do you realize that we are the number three feed company in North America? Do you realize we are feeding 35 percent of the layers of North America? This is huge and this means that we can bring that technology and respond fast. So, size, innovation and speed. And, let’s face it, Canada is only beaten by the Canadians who live in Canada. FLACK Two things come to my mind, David, and Dr. Lyons has touched on them. The product technology will benefit, obviously, our customers, and that technology is designed to promote sustainable, safe, environmentally-friendly and, importantly, profitable meat, milk and egg production in Canada, and that’s what we do every day at Masterfeeds. But this complementary relationship with Alltech is going to enhance that ability and give us more arrows to offer direct to the farm gate. But let me add on to the innovation and technology, what again, I experienced first-hand, a couple of things that just really excited me and I know excites our people, our sales, marketing and nutrition folks in the field, is that Alltech is exploring the benefits of utilizing nutrigenomics to develop advanced feeding programs that will benefit our customers. It’s new and cutting-edge technology that will eventually come to the fore as well as the application, and this is really big right now—growing technology in Canada, antibiotic-free animal nutrition solutions. Those are two things that are at the doorstep of benefits and products and technologies that we are going to be able to incorporate and take to the field, and our people are literally chomping at the bit to try and get at it and take that special advantage that they will have at the farm gate and help our customers become more profitable and more sustainable. It’s right there. It sounds great. When a local company is purchased by a global company, sometimes customers might have concerns that their experience will change. So, Rob do you have a message for customers and what they might be thinking about right now? FLACK Well, a couple of things I would say. First of all, I will add to the term local. Local in terms of country. We are in five provinces. We are going to have 25 feed plants when we’re done; we’re going to have close to 700 employees. We have some scale. I think it’s important to note, and I think Dr. Lyons will agree, that once we conclude here, we’re going to integrate and realign synergies and we’re going to do our best to maximize profitability and performance. It is business as usual. So our customers will have the same sales rep, the same nutrition packages, the same service, the same transportation support. It is business as usual. You know change in life for most people creates uncertainty. And, that’s normal human response. What I have been telling people consistently is that I also believe change can be very positive, and I always embrace it. I like it. It’s kind of part of my DNA, but I try to make that again infectious with everybody that this change with Alltech, albeit a change, and with what Dr. Lyons talked about this earlier, it’s not really change in a major way, it’s a change in a positive and good way, and in this case, Masterfeeds is becoming part of the Alltech family and, in fact, Alltech becoming part of the Masterfeeds family is fantastic and I can’t wait for this positive outcome to play itself out in the marketplace. Dr. Lyons, will this acquisition have any impact on Alltech’s global operation? LYONS Well, first of all, the amazing thing is that when I listen to Rob and I listen to also his people, the words and the things that they are saying and the feelings that they are expressing are spot-on with what makes the Alltech culture. Culture is what makes a business different, and if ever there was an acquisition or merger or a coming together of cultures, which fundamentally are not very different, it is Masterfeeds and Alltech. The other thing to remember is that Alltech doesn’t consider itself to be a global company. We consider ourselves to be a local company. Yes, we operate globally in 128 countries, and we have the advantage of that, but we think very much locally. When we work in places like Brazil, we work through the local language. When we work in Ireland, we work through their local cultures, and we don’t trying to foist upon Canadians a German culture or a French culture. We work locally and I don’t think that the local farmers and the local customers and indeed our friends at Masterfeeds are going to see one thing change, not one thing, because they already have changed. Because they are so close to us, change isn’t necessary. Having said that, what impact could it have on our global business? I was in Latin America earlier in the week and was thinking as I was looking around, “Wow, you know there is a pig starter, there’s a pig creep that in fact I know is made by Masterfeeds that I know would work and work very well down here.” When I saw some of the stores that some of customers that we were visiting, I said I know those stores that Masterfeeds have that would work and work very well. We had to be a little careful of what we said and to whom we said it, but each and every place we went to, “Wow, you’re working with Masterfeeds has been announced. We want to know more about Masterfeeds and oh, by the way, is it a possibility that we could be your Masterfeeds here in Italy, here in Mexico, here in Russia.” It’s just an extension of all of the fun we have had throughout the years. Alright, that is very exciting. Do either of you have any closing comments? FLACK I will maybe start off and let Dr. Lyons conclude. Obviously a lot of work has gone into putting this deal together. There has been a lot of dialogue, a lot of sharing of information, and a lot of communication and again, to reiterate what I said earlier, what has made me so enthused throughout the process has been the open, positive and collaborative work that has taken place thus far, and I know will continue to take place and the adjective that I would use is contagious. What I’m finding with our people is more people go down to Lexington and Alltech folks come up to London to our headquarters, I’m finding there is a contagious enthusiasm that is taking place. Again, I’ve done many deals throughout my career, but this has been the most contagious enthusiasm I have experienced of any one we have ever done. We have 86 years, Dr. Lyons, that we have been around, and we look forward to the next 86 years. You and I probably won’t be around to celebrate, but you never know, through nutrigenomics we may just get there. We may just get there. LYONS All I can say, is this is easy. This is just two like-minded groups coming together and those guys are so excited up there, and we’re so excited down here. Roll on; let’s get it done.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/alltech-and-masterfeeds-good-company","title":"\n\n                    Alltech and Masterfeeds: In Good Company\n                    ","date":"March 14, 2018","contentLength":2967}},{"pageContent":"Tests of varying scientific nature and credibility are widely alleged to have the ability to differentiate between good and bad organic trace minerals (OTMs). The basic parameters that can be analyzed include mineral percentage, nitrogen-to-mineral ratio, percent of bound mineral, molecular weight, bioavailability and stability. While some of these analyses can provide meaningful and valuable information about defined or individual products, understanding the limitations of these tests is critical if they are to be successfully applied in the assessment of OTMs. Mineral percentage Accurate quantification of the total mineral content of OTMs is routinely used by all manufacturers, and cost comparisons between OTMs will consider this when calculating their relative value. Total mineral content, however, gives no information regarding OTM bioavailability and, as such, is limited in terms of calculating the true relative value of a product. Nitrogen-to-metal ratio Calculating the molar ratio of nitrogen to metal can be a useful way to assess glycine-based chelates. When assessing more complex products, such as proteinates, the nitrogen-to-mineral ratio will not give an accurate reflection of the true potential for mineral bonding. More complex amino acids can bind metal atoms through their side chains via sulfur and oxygen atoms. As there is no involvement of nitrogen in this side chain bonding, it is possible to underestimate the potential for binding by only considering the nitrogen-to mineral ratio. The nitrogen content of various products can also be artificially inflated, giving the false impression of a product with high nitrogen-to-mineral ratio. Solubility It is often asserted that an OTM must be soluble to be bioavailable, but many peer-reviewed publications have shown that insoluble OTMs have the potential to be more bioavailable than their soluble counterparts. An evaluation of OTM solubility will be of little benefit unless one considers the effects of the digestive processes and the changing pH environment within the GI tract. Molecular weight Numerous claims have been made about comparing OTMs based on size, and these claims erroneously indicate that a smaller-sized bonding group creates a more stable and more bioavailable OTM. Correlating the molecular weight of an OTM with its stability constant indicates quite clearly that, rather than size being of critical importance in generating a stable OTM, the type of bonding group is of far greater significance. Bioavailability In vitro lab-based assays, which attempt to assess bioavailability, have been developed, making use of cell culture-based assay systems that can determine the transfer and uptake of minerals across cellular membranes. These techniques, however, can’t accurately reflect the influence of digestion on the OTM. As such, their value when comparing different products is limited. Stability When we talk about the stability of OTMs, we are referring to the bond strength that exists between the bonding group and the mineral; the greater the bond strength, the more stable the product. Polarography can be used to assess the bond strength of OTMs — but polarography is only suitable to test materials in solution and can only assess the soluble fraction of organic mineral products. OTMs are increasingly solubilised as a result of the in vivo conditions of the GI tract, so the results of the polarographic tests alone should be interpreted with caution. Percent of bound mineral Historically, determining the percent of bound mineral required utilizing filtration through a low-molecular-weight membrane. The mineral retained behind the filter was assumed to be bound, while the mineral in the filtrate (solution) was assumed to be unbound. Such methods, however, are subject to manipulation, as changing the pH of the buffer can cause precipitation and lead to false estimates of the true bound mineral percentage. The only validated assays that fully quantitate the bound mineral level of an OTM utilize techniques known as ATR-FTIR (attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared) and PXRD (power X-ray diffraction) and were developed by researchers at Alltech’s European Bioscience Centre. The first assay uses a form of infrared (IR) spectroscopy to measure the bound mineral percentage, whereas the second assay uses a form of crystallography to measure the unbound mineral level. These two assays are complementary to each other, and both are peer-reviewed and published. In the case of the IR assay, this was independently validated and verified by the Central Reference Laboratory (CRL), which reports directly to the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). Conclusion While simple tests based on mineral percentage, nitrogen-to-mineral ratio, molecular weight, bioavailability and stability are used by different manufacturers, these tests only provide limited information about individual products and are not suitable for comparing different classes of product. If products will continue to be compared through these tests, understanding their limitations is critical. The only validated assays to assess mineral chelation are based on the use of techniques known as ATR-FTIR and PXRD and were developed and validated by researchers at Alltech’s European Bioscience Centre.

Dietary trace mineral imbalances and deficiencies are commonly corrected by various levels of supplementation from inorganic or organic sources, depending on the animal’s minimum requirement and the trace mineral source bioavailability. Trace mineral requirement and bioavailability depend on intrinsic factors (e.g., species, genetics, age, sex, criterion of adequacy, metabolic function, nutritional status, intestinal flora and physiological stress) and extrinsic factors (e.g., trace mineral element solubility, binding to other dietary factors, state of oxidation, competitive antagonisms and positive or negative chelation effects). Trace minerals and poultry nutrition go way back Trace mineral nutrition discovery and research has a rich history in poultry nutrition. Many of the early nutrient metabolism studies were conducted in chicks during the period between 1960 and 1980, and requirements were established for each poultry species. Based on this research conducted over 40-50 years ago, minimum dietary requirements were established for zinc, manganese, copper, iron, selenium and iodine, and the last official publication of these requirements for poultry was in “Nutrient Requirements of Poultry” (National Research Council, 1994). The genetic potential for growth in commercial poultry has changed dramatically during the last five decades, as has the nature and quality of the diet fed to these animals. This is why supplementation of these trace minerals (usually from inorganic sources) in commercial feeds often exceed the National Research Council (NRC) (1994) recommendations by three- or four-fold to compensate for variable bioavailability, yet resulting in public concern about excessive environmental emissions. Trace mineral programs today Recent research on organic trace minerals has challenged this paradigm of high dietary inclusion of inorganic trace minerals. Due to their increased bioavailability, organic trace minerals have demonstrated opportunities for improved physiological/metabolic functions and reduced environmental emissions, justifying the establishment of new minimum nutritional requirement recommendations. Dietary inclusion of organic trace minerals at levels as low as 12.5 percent of typical commercial levels have been shown to result in equal or superior growth performance and tibia ash. Along with phytase supplementation, which is typically used for most commercial poultry, growth performance can be maintained with organic trace minerals at levels well below the NRC recommendations. Future recommendations for dietary trace minerals will depend upon strategic applications in poultry nutrition that affect environmental sustainability, health and welfare, meat and egg quality, and epigenetic programming.

In the webinar, “The Path of Least Resistance,” we took a dive into the world of antibiotics, specifically how they have impacted and will continue to impact the agriculture industry. The key speaker, Dr. Richard Murphy, explained why we should worry about antibiotic resistance, where we are now with restrictions on antibiotics in livestock health and what opportunities exist for your operations. Our three key takeaways were: Worldwide, scientific evidence indicates an overall decline in the total stock of antibiotic effectiveness; resistance to all first-line and last-resort antibiotics is rising. The livestock and poultry industries are not only facing increasing scrutiny from regulatory bodies such as the FDA and EFSA, but, worldwide, meat processors are starting to demand change.

In Asia, diseases cost the shrimp industry billions of dollars annually (Shinn, et al., 2018). There are numerous diseases that cause this economic loss. This article will provide guidance to help you prevent shrimp diseases by going back to basics with farm management practices, biosecurity and shrimp health management. Common shrimp diseases in Asia No single disease can be definitively named the most severe, as this depends on the area, the timing of the outbreak and the season. Some of the most common shrimp diseases found in Asia are acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), which is caused by bacteria; white-spot syndrome virus (WSSV), which is caused by virus; and Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), the fungal microsporidian. The table below summarizes the symptoms of and prevention methods for each of these diseases. Disease Type Symptoms Prevention Acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND) AHPND mainly infects giant tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon) and whiteleg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei). Asian countries that have reported cases of AHPND include China, Vietnam, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. Bacterial infection with strains of Vibrio parahaem-olyticus. Sudden, mass mortalities (up to 100%), usually within 30–35 days of stocking grow-out ponds (FAO, 2013; Hong et al., 2016; NACA, 2012). AHPND targets gut-associated shrimp tissues and organs. Environmental factors: Overfeeding, poor seed quality, poor water quality, poor feed quality, algal blooms or crashes (FAO, 2013; NACA, 2012). Practices: Improvement of hatchery sanitary conditions and PL screening; good broodstock management; use of high-quality post-larvae; strict feeding rate control; and appropriate stocking density (OIE, 2019). White spot syndrome virus (WSSV) First detected in Taiwan in 1992, WSSV then spread to almost all Asian countries (Sanchéz-Paz, 2010). Virus Rapid reduction in food consumption; lethargy; high mortality (up to 100%) within 3–10 days of the onset of clinical signs; loose cuticle with white spots, most apparent on the inside surface of the carapace; in many cases, moribund shrimp display a pink to reddish-brown coloration due to the expansion of cuticular chromatophores and few, if any, white spots (FAO, 2012). Screening of broodstock, nauplii, PL and grow-out stages; avoiding rapid changes in water conditions; avoiding shrimp stress; avoiding the use of fresh feeds, particularly crustacean; minimizing water exchange to prevent virus carriers from entering the pond; treating infected ponds or hatcheries with 30 ppm chlorine to kill infected shrimp and carriers; and disinfecting associated equipment (FAO, 2012). Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP) EHP is now endemic throughout China, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam, and is likely present in India. Microspori-dian parasite EHP does not cause mortality, but it does heavily limit growth. This pathogen can be detected by using gene-based tools, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and loop-mediated isothermal amplification testing of feces from broodstock (Newman, 2015). Biosecurity in the hatchery (no live feed, disinfection, clean eggs); proper pond preparation (physically remove accumulated organic matter and treat pond bottoms); and proper pond management during the growth cycle (Newman, 2015). Disease can be brought on-farm by water quality, wildlife, equipment, people, stock and feces. They can manifest as external parasites, viral infections, bacterial infections or fungal infections. Therefore, the most practical way to prevent disease and/or reduce the losses they lead to is to implement proper farm management practices and enhance the immune system of the shrimp. Farm management and biosecurity The production cycle of shrimp farming consists of four components: broodstock, hatchery, nursery and grow-out. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), each of these components would require clean water, clean rearing facilities, clean feed, hygienic protocols, and dry-out and break-cycle practice. Shrimp disease treatment is not easy; often, it is more complex than disease prevention. There is not one single solution that fixes all problems, but there are preventive measures that keep pathogens from filtering through shrimp ponds and that keep shrimp healthy. FAO recommends the following best practices in shrimp culture: Choose the right shrimp genetics: i.e., specific pathogen-free (SPF) and high performers for high biosecurity systems. Better biosecurity in shrimp aquaculture begins with clean broodstock that supply eggs and nauplii for hatcheries. The broodstock, whether SPF or non-SPF, should be carefully sourced and certified. This is the first and most important step to take, as it could prevent the disease carriers from entering the culture system. Keep pathogens out: Dry out facilities regularly; disinfect fill and exchange water; control feed; and prevent air and droplet contamination. Biosecurity implementation: Limit the number of visitors (e.g., vehicles, humans, birds, other carriers) to a minimum. Hygiene: Install hand-wash stations, foot baths and wheel washes or tire baths; put up warning signs; disinfect footwear before entering the facilities; and wear boots. Enhancing the immune system of shrimp It is natural for pathogens and bacteria to be present in shrimp ponds. They might not even lead to any diseases for healthy shrimp with strong immune systems. Therefore, it is important to take good care of shrimp gut health and work to bolster their immune systems. This can be achieved by using the right feed additives. One example is supplementation with zinc and selenium. Zinc plays a key role in modulating immune function, resulting in shrimp with increased immune capabilities. Zinc also helps maintain skin integrity and speeds up wound-healing. In addition to zinc, selenium supplementation has been proven to promote shrimp growth and immune health. An Alltech solution that has been effective in field trials in Southeast Asia is Aquate™ Defender. What is Aquate Defender? It is a blend of organic trace minerals (zinc and selenium) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae yeast extract. This product has been shown to help improve performance and bolster the immune system, ultimately increasing the profitability of the farm. Aquate Defender is the solution platform for aquaculture that provides a combination of technologies based on proprietary processes. Aquate Defender technologies help maintain a protective balance between your aquaculture species, their nutrition and the environment in which they live. This optimizes animal performance and helps maintain healthy populations. Researchers at Alltech have developed the Aquate Defender range of nutritional solutions in partnership with our global customer base, using our three core technologies: peptide technologies, solid-state fermentation (SSF) and yeast fermentation. Aquate Defender is specifically designed to address producers’ concerns about the gastrointestinal stability of their animals. Aquate Defender solutions help producers as they work to achieve their animals' true potential and enhance their profitability. About Aquate Defender: Promotes good bacteria and builds defenses Promotes gastrointestinal integrity and stability Enhances nutrient utilization Reinforces the function of the digestive system Optimizes performance and profitability Aquate Defender can improve the gut microvilli length, thus improving overall nutrient absorption, which can translate to growth performance (see Figure 1 below).

The average bodyweight of the harvested shrimp increased 0.77 g, and FCR was reduced by 0.24. Overall, the yield per hectare increased 1.96 tons per hectare, and the return on investment (ROI) for the application of Aquate Defender was 7 to 1, compared to the control. Figure 2: Results of a commercial trial of white shrimp showing improved performance with Aquate Defender Alltech vs. control Mean body weight (MBW) +0.77 g Average length +1.23 cm Production per pond +979 kg FCR -0.24 Production per hectare +1,960 kg ROI 7.1:1 By improving food absoption and gut health, Aquate Defender increased bodyweight and production. Source: A large farm in Malaysia (Sept. 2012) Research and local field trials conducted in Malaysia and Indonesia have proven that, when Aquate Defender is used, the shrimp gut is heathier, with a longer and better villi structure that leads to better absorption. Farmers using Aquate Defender in their nutrition programs are experiencing more successful rates of shrimp culture. In several Asian countries, customers who have previously used Aquate Defender continue to use this product in their feeding programs. Although shrimp disease is the main challenge in shrimp culture, it can be prevented and overcome with good farm management practices and a strong biosecurity system. As an animal health and feed additives company, Alltech and its solutions can support you by improving the immune health of your shrimp and increasing both your productivity per hectare and, ultimately, your profitability.

A nutrient that is hiding in plain sight, water is concealed under the cover of water lines and nipple drinkers, so it is not given too much thought. However, not thinking about the water flowing in your barn can be harmful to bird health and, ultimately, your bottom line. Layers and broilers consume close to twice the amount of water as feed, so attention to water quality and access to water should be in every poultry producer’s standard operating procedure. There are a couple of factors to be aware of when thinking about water, including: 1. Avoid biofilms Once biofilms are established in the water lines, whether or not they can be seen, the water lines are almost 101,000 times harder to clean and to rid of bacteria. If bacteria are caught in the biofilm, they become inaccessible to the cleaners and can break off and reach the birds. It is important to properly and effectively clean the water lines between flocks. Using an effective sanitization program and flushing the lines will help to break up and remove the biofilm. This cleaning step may have to be repeated when the flock leaves the barn and again before the next flock comes in. Always be sure to flush and run fresh water through the water lines just before the new flock arrives in order to avoid any leftover cleaners in the water. Leftover cleaner can negatively impact the birds. Clean the water lines while the flock is in the barn. While it is more difficult to clean and sanitize the water lines while the flock is in the barn, this is an important step to avoid the buildup of biofilms. Remember, a single E. coli organism can multiply into 24 trillion organisms in 24 hours at a temperature of 32 degrees Celsius (similar to brooding temperatures). As a result, you have to choose an effective, yet mild sanitizer. The sanitizer must be used under proper conditions to work effectively. For example, chlorine requires an acidic pH of around 5-6.5 and a free chlorine level of 2 - 5 ppm to be effective. 2. Is the equipment working? It is important to check if the equipment is free from biofilms on the outside and that the equipment is working. The uneven height of a water line, due to something as simple as a stretch in one of the cords holding the water line up, can cause air blockage and prevent birds from accessing water. On the other hand, simple wear and tear on the drinkers or scale/rust buildup can cause leaky nipple drinkers. Leaky nipple drinkers can mean that water is getting everywhere except the bird’s mouth and can cause wet litter that may negatively impact performance. 3. Access to water It is critical to ensure the stocking density of the barn allows all birds access to feed and water. Some producers may even choose to use additional waterers during brooding. The height of the water line is another critical point in guaranteeing that all birds have access to water. A water line height appropriate for the size of the birds will encourage them to drink and, ultimately, help with health and performance. Many additives can be added through water, such as minerals, vitamins, antibiotics, flavors, acidifiers, vaccines, etc. Whenever using any of these additives, it is important that the water is free of anything that could interfere with the success of the additives and that the water line is flushed after the additives are used. When done correctly, the water can be used as an effective method to deliver additives to birds, especially during times of heat stress. Acid-Pak 4-Way® 2X is an Alltech technology that can be added to the water and is used to maintain optimum conditions for digestion in the stomach and the small intestine. This technology helps to: Optimize pH levels. Support digestion. Maintain water balance. Water is an important nutrient and can be used to help promote poultry immune status, gut health and performance. Let’s not forget about the water!

In just the last few years, we have landed the rover Curiosity on Mars, discovered the Higgs boson particle and discovered gravitational waves. Hunt, a self-proclaimed science fiction fan, seemed especially impressed by the harpooning of a comet in 2015. Technological advances on the farm Hunt has worked for years on some amazing, but slightly more down-to-earth than comet capture, technologies. He and his twin brother co-founded Cainthus, a company dedicated to digitizing agriculture. He described some of the company’s projects in breakout discussions on dairy and the future of farming at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference. Facial recognition for cows The audience got a glimpse into a few fascinating technologies, some of which are here now and others that are right around the corner. Digital cameras are at the core of many of these advancements. Cainthus has developed facial recognition software for dairy farms that can memorize the face of a cow in six seconds and monitor the activity of an entire herd without wearable tracking devices. They are creating algorithms that will allow their software to alert a farmer when cows show early signs of lameness or when they fight over the best feed. When cows fight, it typically disrupts the entire herd and interrupts them from feeding for up to two hours, which certainly has an impact on milk production. Scouting fields with drones Drones are being adopted at a rapid rate on the farm, and Hunt talked about both the potential and the limitations of their use. Self-flying drones are already very successful for monitoring crop growth. Hunt looks forward to a day when farms are photographed twice a day. He warned farmers not to accept any offers from companies offering to fly drones over their farm manually. The cost is prohibitive and would not allow frequent enough flyovers to be beneficial. Current drones are disruptive for use in animal agriculture and will not be fully effective until they are small enough to go unnoticed by animals or can fly high enough that they won’t be seen. The future of agricultural robotics Robots will have an enormous impact on agriculture in the next several years. Hunt showed a video of two dog-like robots walking side by side. One was large and clumsy looking, the 2010 model. The other was sleek and graceful and was released just four years later. “Imagine what they will look like by 2050,” said Hunt. The significance of robotics for agriculture is huge. Robotic harvesters could allow farming to return to polyculture, the practice of growing multiple crops side by side in the same field. Planting and harvesting with combines has allowed farmers to feed an ever-growing population by ramping up production, but it is dependent on monoculture planting. Polyculture is closer to the natural ecosystem, and proponents say that it results in better soil health and easier pest management. Digitizing agricultural decisions Digitizing agriculture will allow farmers to make decisions based on data rather than emotion or hype. Hunt stressed the importance of this, emphasizing the need to base decisions on what is happening on your own farm and not anecdotal evidence from another farm, even the one next door. “Just because a product works incredibly well on your neighbor’s field doesn’t mean that it will work well on your field,” said Hunt. “If we have precision management observing what things work, what works, what does not work, on a meter-by-meter basis and a plant-by-plant basis, there is no emotion, there is no hype. There’s just good decisions and maximization of productivity.” In closing, Hunt offered a challenge. “We have an opportunity today to use the tools that are here to create a utopia by 2050,” said Hunt. “We also have the tools available today to have this planet being a desert by 2050. The choices we make today are going to determine which one we leave behind for our children.” David Hunt was a presenter at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference.

With production outstripping consumption and prices being squeezed, producers are looking for more ways to improve the efficiency of their businesses. To try to achieve this, many are looking into how they can: Improve eggshell quality. Increase the number of eggs laid, with regular discussions around a target of 500 eggs per bird. Lengthen the laying cycle. With these objectives in mind, the role of layer gut health in production has never been more pertinent. Egg production, for the laying hen, is a taxing process, considering the energy they use and the stress they endure. It is a biologically complex procedure, and to achieve the highest-quality eggs, the bird’s performance needs to be optimal. By trying to push the boundaries of a bird’s laying capability, we run the risk of compromising the quality of the end result. If gut health in layers is not at its best, you will see the effects in the eggs they produce. In fact, gastrointestinal challenges are known to be connected to: Fragile shells. Dirty eggs. Short and less abundant laying cycles. These are issues that will not only hurt your birds but, in the long term, hurt your profits, too. By making gut health a priority, we can ensure that layers have the resources they need to produce successfully. On top of this, when we talk about pushing the boundaries in terms of what our birds can do, optimal gut health is the key to safely achieving these goals. Eggshell essentials When aiming to “improve eggshell quality,” it is essential to distinguish precisely what that means. Generally, a good-quality shell is one that does not crack easily and, as a result, will reduce the number of seconds. However, increasing shell thickness does not necessarily improve quality; it is the structure of the shell that is crucial. Many enzymes and minerals are involved in the creation of the shell structure. Layers receive the required minerals through their diet, but these minerals must be readily bioavailable for them to be useful in the egg-creation process. The small intestine cannot absorb non-bioavailable minerals. We also need to be wary of how much of a mineral is included in the diet formulation, as well as the interactions of that mineral once it is consumed. Calcium carbonate, for example, is crucial for eggshell formation, and it is often presumed that increasing the amount of calcium in the diet will automatically lead to more durable shells. However, there is a negligible balance to be considered. Calcium, when dissolved in the gastrointestinal system, can interact with other minerals, reducing their absorption. This, in turn, can have a direct impact on other structural components of the egg, diminishing quality. With these factors in mind, the best method for ensuring optimum bioavailability is to use chelated minerals in the diet. They will have fewer reactions with other minerals, allowing the bird to absorb more of the mineral. By ensuring that layers are getting the most out of their feed, we give them the best chance to maintain a healthy gut and, as a result, produce high-quality eggs. Laying healthier and longer The laying hen can naturally continue to produce eggs for many years, but her peak production will naturally decline with age. Genetic advances in recent years have allowed birds to produce nearly one egg per day, from week 18 to week 75. In some cases, however, the push for large eggs — which come at end-of-lay — has extended this period to 80+ weeks. Lengthening the egg-laying period puts more stress on the bird, as she must create a metabolically rich egg while also maintaining her body weight and dealing with any additional challenges from the environment that may impact the immune system. It is worth noting that if the energy requirements of the bird are not being met, at a certain point, her body will shut down the reproductive system that was producing the eggs in favor of supporting her body weight and providing energy for vital bodily systems. Healthy gut, healthy lay Between 50–80% of the immune system functions in some way through the gut. Many factors can trigger the immune system, such as: Mycotoxins. New diets. High levels of potentially pathogenic bacteria, known as dysbacteriosis. The immune response in the gut generally takes the form of inflammation, which produces additional mucous layers. Added mucous creates an extra barrier for the minerals to pass through before being absorbed. This means that if an inflammatory response is underway, it is unlikely that the bird will receive its full mineral requirement, impacting eggshell structure and, therefore, strength and quality. Maintaining and promoting gut health in flocks: Increases villi height. Reduces villi-crypt ratio. Improves tight junctions between cells. Villi with improved height will have an enhanced surface area and, therefore, can absorb more nutrients to sustain the hen for longer lay cycles. Improving tight junctions will prevent bacteria from becoming translocated into the bloodstream, which can lead to a multitude of problems — including, in the worst cases, diseases like colisepticemia. The addition of Actigen®, a unique bioactive product derived from the Saccharomyces cervisiae yeast strain, in layer feed can help to optimize gut health. Actigen works to normalize and promote diverse gut bacteria. This helps with the maintenance of the bird’s gastrointestinal integrity and stability, which, in turn, supports its immune defense and gut health. Getting the balance right In a natural setting, the microbiome — the microbial population in the gut — is developed from the mother as the chick is raised in the nest. Our modern systems mean that this does not happen, so the creation and maintenance of the microbiome should be considered when determining management practices. Keeping the microbiome balanced will go a long way to improving layer gut health and egg production. Many producers have been successful in improving gut health and the microbiome via the implementation of Alltech’s Seed, Feed, Weed program to manage the composition of the intestinal microbial community. This involves accelerating the evolution of the microbial community to a steady state and then maintaining the status quo. The Seed, Feed, Weed program achieves this by: Seeding the gut with favorable organisms. Feeding these favorable organisms. Weeding out the unfavorable organisms. By helping to maintain the microbiome balance, this program works to improve shell quality and enable a healthier, longer lay. Producers in the egg industry are desperately seeking out ways to help their birds continue to lay more in the safest way possible. Quality food will help layers produce quality eggs — but this is only effective if the bird is able to absorb the beneficial nutrients that come from it in the first place. Improving the gut health of birds in lay will enable them to absorb a higher proportion of their feed. This will not only aid the overall wellbeing of the layer but will also give them the foundations to successfully and safely produce better eggs for a longer period of time.

Every living organism, including humans and pets, have all kinds of microorganisms (such as bacteria, fungi, viruses and protozoa) living on and within their bodies. These microorganisms live together as communities, and the collection of their genomes is referred as the microbiome. Microbiome communities are unique to certain habitats, such as the skin, lungs and the gut, to name a few, and can be crucial for pet immune system health. Pet nutrition and diets are deeply connected to the composition and diversity of the microbiome, which, in turn, plays a significant role in the proper function of the digestive and immune systems of dogs and cats, ultimately affecting their overall health and well-being.

Esca, a wood disease affecting grapes all over the world, is one of the biggest modern threats to grape production. Esca is a complex disease involving several different fungi. It attacks the main vine of the plant and can destroy it within a few days; there is no questioning the unstoppable pace at which this disease progresses. Esca is one of the oldest-known diseases to afflict grape vines, having been noted by the Greeks and Romans and damaging vineyards quite heavily in the early 1900s. In twentieth-century France, more than 5% of vines were killed by esca each year. Because the disease grows at a slow but progressive pace, even the larger, well-established vineyards could be totally destroyed by esca in 15 to 20 years. Esca was first successfully controlled in 1903, when sodium arsenite was used as an insecticide on grapes and quickly proved its ability to limit esca and other wood diseases. In fact, thanks to the use of sodium arsenite, research on the disease effectively stopped in 1920 — only to begin again in 1980, when a potential ban on the product was discussed. Sodium arsenite, which was noted as being highly toxic and carcinogenic in 1987, was banned in France in 2001 and by the rest of Europe in 2003. Subsequently, grape growers have seen a re-emergence of esca, and, since 2001, 6–7% of vines must be replaced annually. Additionally, along with the traditional form of esca, a new form appeared — an “apoplectic” form that can cause the vine to dry up entirely within the first few hours of showing symptoms. Today, there are no registered chemical or biological solutions for mitigating this disease. Studying and developing traditional solutions for combatting esca are difficult because of its complexity. Esca impacts producers economically on multiple levels: the use of prophylactic measures (of debatable efficacy) can increase costs, while pulled-out vines, reduced yields and money spent on replantation can reduce income. France, for example, estimates that 11% of the nation’s total number of grape vines are non-productive as a result of esca. Between 2003 (when sodium arsenate was prohibited there) and 2007, Spain saw the number of affected vineyards grow from 1.8% to 10.5%. This rate continues its upward trend — and epidemiological studies carried out in Tuscany, Marche, Abruzzi, Apulia and Sicily showed that, in regions like central and southern Italy, among others, the incidence of esca has reached an extreme 60–80% in older vineyards. Alltech Crop Science explores natural-based solutions for esca Alltech Crop Science, a global leader in natural-based, innovative solutions, is exploring alternative programs to help farmers protect their vines.

The well-known toxin is showing up in storage grains, posing heightened risks to dairy production. Looking at feedstuff samples submitted and tested through the Alltech 37+® mycotoxin analytical services laboratory over the past several years, results show a pattern of very low total aflatoxin levels and occurrence across North America. However, in recent months, AFB1 has been appearing more frequently and at higher levels in samples submitted from the Northern United States and Canada. Aflatoxins, part of the Aspergillus fungi family, are commonly detected in cottonseeds/cottonseed meal, typically grown in the Southern United States. More recently, the Northern states and Ontario are finding that commodities such as haylage, corn silage, corn and high moisture corn are testing positive, with significant levels of AFB1 above 20 parts per billion (ppb), while cottonseed samples have contained no measurable levels. The question is, why are rising levels occurring now? The reasons behind rising levels of aflatoxin B1 This spring, North America experienced above normal temperatures. These warmer temperatures, in combination with the weather at harvest and various storage conditions could be promoting the growth of Aspergillus mold, causing an increased observance of AFB1. Research from Cheli et al. (2013) showed that Aspergillus flavus can grow in a wide range of temperatures from 50 to 109 degrees Fahrenheit (10-43°C), and in pH levels ranging from 2.1 to 11.2. The same is true for aflatoxin production by mold. If producers have not stored their feedstuffs correctly, changes in environmental temperatures after the post-winter thaw and during spring months can cause an increase in mycotoxin production. Another study by Keller et al. (2013) demonstrated AFB1 contamination frequency levels were higher on post-fermentation silage samples when compared to pre-fermented samples. This suggests that Aspergillus flavus and AFB1 contamination is enhanced during storage. Poor storing conditions and improper practices during the ensiling process, or even after a silo is cut for feed out, can lead to this kind of contamination. According to the Alltech 37+ mycotoxin analysis, corn silage samples collected and analyzed from January through April 2016 across North America saw AFB1 in approximately 30 percent of the 116 samples at levels up to 90 ppb. For the same time period in 2015, AFB1 tested positive in only six percent of samples, and zero percent in 2014. The implications of rising aflatoxin B1 levels Aflatoxins at higher levels can cause a decrease in feed intake, altered rumen function, lowered milk production and increased somatic cell count. At lower levels, cows may not always show symptoms of aflatoxin consumption but may have altered milk quality due to the occurrence of aflatoxin M1 (AFM1). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations state that active levels of AFB1 may not exceed 20 ppb in feedstuffs or feeds for dairy cows and 0.5 ppb of AFM1 before milk must be discarded. In these cases, producers may need to dump milk, impacting the bottom line. Results from the Alltech 37+ also showed a multi-contamination setting with 93 percent of samples testing positive for two or more mycotoxins. Other mycotoxins frequently present at higher levels include type B trichothecenes (DON group) at 84 percent, and fumonisins and fusaric acid at 81 percent. In settings such as these, mitigation strategies such as the use of a sequestering agent can aid in offsetting the negative effects of multiple mycotoxin contamination on cow health. As corn silage is only one component of the total mixed rations (TMR), producers are encouraged to protect their herds by testing feed for moisture, mold count, yeast count and mycotoxins to understand what is being included in the TMR. Implementation of proper storage and feeding practices is crucial to minimize the opportunity for mycotoxins to flourish. When cows do not perform to their potential, corn silage quality and possible contamination should be considered.

Damien McLoughlin, Anthony C. Cunningham Professor of Marketing at the University College Dublin Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School, opened up the final plenary session of ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference by discussing a strategy for differentiation. “What is it that you can do to make your competition irrelevant?” asked McLoughlin. “What is it that you can do to make competition less significant in your competitive and business life?” The theme of McLoughlin’s talk pivoted off these questions. He gave many reasons why he believes competition is more intense right now, but the most important factor is the advance in technology. “Today, all of the power is with the buyer,” said McLoughlin. He said places like China, the Philippines, Vietnam and other competitors of the U.S “have access to ideas from the old world and they are applying those at new markets in the new world.” “They’re pushing competitive activity in a way that we haven’t experienced before,” he explained. “These first three forces (Technology, globalization, demographic change), of course, are all beyond the control of any person in this room… However, there is one other force, which is impacting our ability to affect competition; that’s the strategic or strategy choice.” McLoughlin then explored the “red ocean” and “blue ocean” strategies that define businesses. Red ocean strategy A prime example of a “red ocean” business is the soda industry. McLoughlin said that when you see soda in a grocery store, everything is priced the same and looks exactly alike. “When their competitor takes action, they copy it straight away,” he said, illustrating one of the signs of a red ocean. He believes this strategy consists of companies that compete in existing market spaces, beat the competition, exploit existing demand, make the value-cost trade-off and align the firm’s activities with its strategic choice of differentiation or low cost. According to one of McLoughlin’s slides, the “red ocean” is the death of a firm. Blue ocean strategy McLoughlin used Southwest Airlines as an example of a “blue ocean” business. “They smashed the rules of competitive engagement, created large uncontested new markets, simultaneously pursued value and low cost,” he said. The outcome of this strategy was that Southwest Airline is now the number one airline in the U.S, with an 18.5 percent market share in 2016. A blue ocean strategy is the exact opposite of the red ocean strategy. You will know you have a blue ocean company if you, “create uncontested market spaces, make the competition irrelevant, create and capture new demand, break the idea of value-cost trade-off, align the whole system of a firm’s activity in pursuit of differentiation and low cost,” said McLoughlin. “It’s a tall task,” he said. McLoughlin says that the main core principle of blue ocean strategy is value innovation. “What I mean by that is, we find ways to reduce our cost,” he said. The craft beer industry, Ocado (an online supermarket in the United Kingdom) and Justin Trudeau, prime minister of Canada, are also successful utilizers of blue ocean strategies. McLoughlin asked the audience two questions: 1.Do you dare to be different? 2.Are you willing to invest the strategic thinking time needed to create blue oceans? He said four tools are needed for a blue ocean strategy within a company: The strategy canvas. The four actions framework. Find new customers by looking for non-customers. Price corridor of the masses - Price to encourage as many people as possible to buy the product.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/dive-your-blue-ocean","title":"\n\n                    Dive into your blue ocean\n                    ","date":"May 25, 2016","contentLength":610}},{"pageContent":"“Having me on staff, a registered dietitian, working at an animal nutrition and crop science company is really unheard of.” In one sentence, nutrition specialist Nikki Putnam spoke volumes about what distinguishes Alltech in the world of agriculture. Yes, it’s an animal nutrition and crop science company, but it’s actually much more. And the reason for that is the three-decade guidance of its ACE principle: Alltech’s belief that new technologies and their adoption throughout the food chain will contribute to a more sustainable world. The principle mandates that any such technologies “must improve the health and welfare of Animals, satisfy Consumer demands and protect the Environment.” This installment of our ACE series highlights Alltech’s quest to address the rise of the socially conscious consumer and their demand for healthy, safe and sustainably produced food. Following through to the end of the food chain We begin at the end. The end of the food chain, that is, and Putnam’s dot-connecting role at Alltech. “It’s very rare in this industry to have someone who is solely focused on human nutrition helping to bridge the gap between what we’re doing in crop science research and production, what we’re doing with animal nutrition and animal science, and bringing that around to ‘How is this applicable to human health, nutrition and increasing well-being?’” said Putnam. Accommodating the expectations of an evolving consumer culture presents its challenges. “That culture has been changing a lot in the last five years, and we’re well-adapted to address it because we can say, ‘This is an organic product that is traceable through an organic production system. This is a product that is non-GMO; this is an antibiotic-free product,’” said Dr. Karl Dawson, vice president and chief scientific officer at Alltech. “These types of products are arriving on grocery shelves now and in the restaurant,” he said. “Even fast food chains are using these terms. We try to build our sales and research programs around that.” In fact, Alltech has partnered with the leading third-party audit for Whole Foods, Where Food Comes From, to become the flagship company for their Feed Verified program. This verification is important to Alltech because it provides clear, traceable assurance for claims, such as antibiotic-free, so consumers can trust and understand how their food was raised. Listening to the consumer Dr. Steven Borst, general manager of Alltech’s crop science division, would have enough on his plate focusing on the myriad issues associated with growing plants, but he also keeps in mind the needs and desires of the ultimate consumers of crops: humans. “Consumers want to know that what they’re picking up in the supermarket is completely safe, is being grown in a manner that would be sustainable,” he said. “Consumers are demanding more accountability and more and more traceability. We’ve helped strengthen the ability for the consumer to know that.” Alltech Crop Science is focused on providing natural inputs as viable alternatives to the synthetic chemicals that inspire consumer concerns and resistance. “We’re improving our soil, increasing the nutrient availability by allowing the plant to uptake more nutrients,” said Dr. Kyle McKinney, Alltech Crop Science development manager for Central America and the Caribbean. Agriculture is undergoing a mindset change Borst finds farmers and producers increasingly sensitive to how their products are received in the marketplace. They are gravitating to a new, more expansive way of thinking. “The mindset that says, ‘I need to spray X to kill Y in order to achieve excess yields,’ that silver bullet mentality has completely shifted,” he said. “Farmers are looking not just at boosting yields, but for ways to mitigate, say, a weed problem, and how does that impact the entire holistic system? That’s a major shift that we’ve started to see. It’s driven by farmers wanting to take better care of their land and come up with alternative ways to maximize profits, as well as the potential of their croplands and systems.” No one, Borst said, cares more about the land and the environment than the farmer. “There’s no more of a scientist than a farmer,” he explained. “We’re seeing continual management program and thought-process changes. That’s a relatively new phenomenon that’s occurred over the past 10 years. I would argue that when we started Alltech Crop Science, we were 30 years ahead of the curve in regard to this mentality. Now it’s starting to catch up.” Banana growers are listening Banana production in Costa Rica offers a clear example of how Alltech technology is replacing unsustainable practices. The banana plantations of Costa Rica have been plagued by black sigatoka, also known as “black leaf streak,” a disease spread by the fungus Mycosphaerella fijiensis. For plantation owners, battling this disease has been a choice between frequent application of chemical fungicides or losing their crops. “Producers want to reduce this (dependency on chemicals),” said McKinney, who is currently stationed in Costa Rica, working on solutions. “Consumers are demanding it and buyers are demanding it, so they’re looking for alternatives.” The focus of McKinney’s current work is on two products from the Alltech Crop Science portfolio: Soil-Set® and Agro-Mos®. Trials of the products transitioned early this year to commercial application. “Starting in January of 2017, we went from zero hectares to over 3,000 hectares in one month,” said McKinney. “Producers saw and believed in the results and took the steps to reduce their chemical usage because here’s something that allows them to do it naturally, and they can feel good about it.” Going to the source of a dietary imbalance Consuming omega-3 fatty acids, mostly by eating fish, is associated with the prevention or reduction in severity of a multitude of ailments, from heart and kidney diseases and diabetes to Alzheimer’s disease and osteoarthritis, according to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). But in the Western world in particular, consumption of foods that deliver adequate levels of omega-3 is woefully low. Human beings evolved on a diet with a ratio of omega-6/omega-3 essential fatty acids of approximately 1:1. But, in Western diets, the ratio is 15:1, according to the NCBI. Numerous diseases are linked to this imbalance and a resulting serious deficiency of DHA, a compound contained in omega-3 fatty acids that, while essential to human health, is not produced by vertebrates. “We’re trying to increase the amount of omega-3s that consumers are eating because when that ratio is out of whack, we see a lot of inflammation in the body,” said Putnam. \"Inflammation is the root cause of all chronic disease — heart disease, diabetes, Alzheimer’s, arthritis, etc.” But, there’s a catch. Omega-3 historically has been obtained from fish oil. Increasing demand, however, has pushed the world’s fisheries to or beyond capacity, with many of these ecosystems at risk of collapse. The alternative to overfishing in the ocean is aquaculture. The fish farming industry’s own demand for fish oil and meal to feed its stocks, however, has only added to the pressure on ocean fisheries. Alltech researchers have found a solution in Aurantiochytrium limacinum, one among the tens of thousands of named species of algae. “We’re growing our own algae — the same algae that those fatty fish are consuming through their diets in the ocean,” said Putnam. “That’s what gives them their DHA and total omega-3 content in their tissues. “So, instead of relying on those fatty fish in the ocean to provide us that fish oil or those omega-3 fatty acids, we’re growing that same strain ourselves,” she continued. “That way we can preserve the fish for protein sources and use our algae as the omega-3 or DHA source in aquaculture and livestock diets.” These algal-based products are being produced at the Alltech Algae plant in Winchester, Kentucky, USA, one of the largest commercial algae production sites in the world. Dr. Sasha Tozzi, the facility’s technical manager, said studies have found that balancing the omega-6/omega-3 ratio is associated with decreased mortality and prevention of cardiovascular diseases, certain types of cancer and inflammation among rheumatoid arthritis sufferers. The benefits of the balance don’t stop there. “It’s good for pregnant women and the early development of children to have a high-DHA diet because what mommy eats is what the baby eats,” said Tozzi. “You improve hand-eye coordination, visual acuity, motor skills, attention spans, verbal and social skills. And there are a lot of studies that show how different concentrations of intake of DHA at different ages really improves cognitive ability and behavior in children.” Alltech’s growing portfolio of algae-derived products and applications are being marketed worldwide. The products are currently undergoing U.S. Food and Drug Administration registration and trials required for sales in the United States. Reducing antibiotics in the food chain The use of antibiotics in livestock has become a hot-button issue for consumers concerned about the effects to human health as well as the evolution of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. “Consumers are looking for alternatives,” noted Dr. Kristen Brennan, a research project manager at the Alltech Center for Animal Nutrigenomics and Applied Animal Nutrition in Nicholasville, Kentucky. “Some don’t want antibiotics to have been given to the animal proteins they buy. With our work, we can provide not just alternatives to antibiotics, but more viable alternatives.” And, in a nod to the ACE principle, the goal has been to develop solutions that are beneficial to the animal, the producer and the consumer, said Brennan. Simply eliminating antibiotics from production animals will not in and of itself solve the problem of antimicrobial resistance. “We have created the problem over the past 70 years, and we can’t expect to resolve it overnight,” said Dawson. “We must turn the tables and address eliminating antibiotic resistance from the environment.” In Dawson’s view, that means being forward-thinking by developing and implementing practices that keep production animals healthy, which reduces a need for antibiotics. This can be as basic as improved farm hygiene and more biosecure animal housing, bearing in mind that even the cleanest operations can still experience disease. Strategic nutritional management programs are an important component as well. Among the alternatives to antibiotics are direct-fed microbials, prebiotics and plant extracts. Alltech is ahead of the curve, having pioneered antibiotic-free technologies since the company was founded in 1980. This has led to new innovations backed by 733 published trials, resulting in multiple developments in the area of antibiotic-free production. The Alltech® Antibiotic-Free program starts by supporting the animal’s immune and digestive system and allows for periods of adjustment. As the producer advances to the next level, the program helps provide a gut health management approach. This includes seeding the gut with favorable gut microflora, feeding the beneficial bacteria and maintaining a proper intestinal environment, and weeding out unfavorable microorganisms to support immune defense. The next step is the full Alltech Antibiotic-Free program, which provides a complete approach to animal well-being, including management, nutrition and technical support. The program supports animals with maximum health benefits through Alltech’s full range of technologies, allowing them to reach their genetic potential and helping producers to attain a sustainable and profitable future. “Our goal is to make sure producers have the right tools and resources necessary to make this transition as safely and profitably as possible while still getting the consumer the quality product they want for themselves and their families,” said Aidan Connolly, Alltech vice president and chief innovation officer. Environmentally friendly livestock Today’s consumers also express worries about the environmental impacts of livestock. “We look at the efficiency with which these animals produce food for humans,” said Alltech research project manager Dr. Amanda Gehman. “If we can have an efficient animal, that animal is by nature a more environmentally sustainable animal.” Dawson agrees. “The environmental impact follows,” he noted. “If you are putting less feed into an animal and having less waste material, then you’re talking about an immediate environmental impact, whether that’s the manure that is spread on the land or the methane that escapes from the cow or the pig.” This attention to sustainability in livestock production matters not only to grocery store shoppers, but also to many restaurant executive chefs, including Jonathan Searle of the Louisville, Kentucky-based boutique hotel chain 21C Museum Hotels. “Along with looking for the highest quality locally sourced beef, we’re actively looking for a provider that is environmentally aware and taking steps to lower their carbon footprint,” he said. Alltech has harnessed the innovative power of biotechnology to offer a variety of solutions to many of the farm-level issues becoming of interest to consumers. Examples include: Alltech E-CO2 provides environmental assessment services to livestock producers, enabling them to closely monitor the carbon footprints of their operations. Optigen® is Alltech's non-protein nitrogen source for ruminants. It concentrates the nitrogen fraction of the diet, creating dry matter space for more fiber and energy. Optigen has become a solution to feed and environmental problems. Allzyme® SSF is based on an ancient process called solid state fermentation (SSF). A selected strain of (non-GMO) is used to work in synergy with the animal’s digestive system in breaking down layers of the feed that were previously inaccessible through digestion. With the increasing global population and need for food, it is essential that producers get optimal performance from their animals and their diets. Alltech® In Vitro Fermentation Model (IFM) is a diagnostic tool that simulates rumen fermentation and evaluates the nutritive value of total mixed rations in terms of digestibility and end-products formation. IFM can help nutritionists determine if protein supply may be limiting microbial protein production and help make recommendations to address that issue. In addition, IFM researchers can identify opportunities in the ration to take advantage of reformulation. Total Replacement Technology™ provides organic forms of trace minerals (zinc, copper, manganese and selenium) that are more bioavailable to the animal, reducing waste and heavy metal pollution. The BioBarrel®, an edible feed supplement container manufactured by Alltech’s Ridley Block Operations, is providing producers with an effective land management tool that can be used to regulate the movement of herds and prevent overgrazing. KEENAN, the Alltech-owned manufacturer of diet feeders, is increasing farm efficiency by producing an advanced optimal physical mix of feed that improves yield, quality and returns. The company’s InTouch service provides producers with live support from skilled nutritionists who offer key advice for better data-driven decision-making. Yea-Sacc® is a yeast culture based on a proprietary strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a yeast strain specifically selected for its influence on animal performance. Yea-Sacc helps stabilize the rumen environment for improved feed efficiency and is ideal for beef, dairy, calf and equine feeds. Helping producers ACE the consumer connection Today’s farmers are looking for technologies and products that help them provide consumers with quality meats, eggs, milk, fruit and vegetables, as well as information about the origins of foods and how it was produced. Alltech, with a corporate culture that considers the entire food chain, from seed to steak and salad, is enabling the integration of innovative technologies with on-farm practices. In our fourth and final installment, we will take a look at how ACE has evolved since its inception some 30 years ago and how it might be expected to carry the company and its customers forward into the future.

Do you go with organic trace minerals, or do you turn to the dark side: inorganics? It should be an easy choice, but many get led astray by practices that date back over a decade-and-a-half. If you were to look at how many times the human food pyramid has been updated since then, you would see constant improvement. Likewise, how can we keep our animals’ diets in pace with this constant development of nutritional innovation? It starts with choosing a side when it comes to your minerals. Choose the side with less mineral waste To examine an animal’s diet, you often have to look at what is coming out the other end. If the animal’s waste has undigested feed in it, that signals two possibilities: One, the diet is over-fortified with an ingredient; or two, the animal is having trouble digesting the ingredient. Recent studies have shown that grow-finish pigs fed a diet with the total replacement of inorganics with organic minerals had reduced fecal manganese, copper and selenium excretion (Alltech-Zhejiang University Animal Nutrition and Feed Science Research Alliance). Another study looking at supplementing organic trace minerals at 0, 50 or 100 percent of the National Research Council (NRC) recommendations showed that nursery pigs and finishing pigs’ trace mineral requirements did not appear to need dietary trace mineral supplementation at the levels recommended by NRC. This research highlights the fact that organic minerals are better absorbed, stored and utilized by the animal. The more that is absorbed by the animal means less waste reaches the environment and less is wasted from the producer’s pocket book. Choose the side you can trust Not all minerals are made the same. Inorganics have an added level of contamination risk for both feed and food. This comes in the form of dioxins, PCBs and heavy metals. In the 2015 Asia-Pacific Heavy Metal Survey, where 498 mineral samples were tested, the trend for heavy metal contamination over the past five years showed an average of 19.4 percent. This contamination figure should be scary for producers, as that leads to an increased risk of immune suppression, liver/kidney damage, decreased growth and even contamination of the tissue. It is important to know where your minerals are coming from and that they are being tested to ensure safety for your animals and the food chain. Alltech’s Q+ (Quality Plus) process is a positive release program that guarantees all incoming batches of raw material sources and final product batches are tested for dioxins, PCBs and heavy metals prior to sale, providing a safe and traceable product that producers can trust. Choose the side that’s better for your pigs’ health and performance Minerals are an important part of the pig’s diet, but they are not meant to be just another ingredient. Effective mineral nutrition can have a very significant on health and performance. Organic trace minerals have shown to support the number of pigs born (The Ohio State University). That means a lot for producers looking to reduce overall production costs per pig. In addition to reducing costs, another major concern is the health of the pig. Additional studies have shown that trace minerals supplementation supports healthy antioxidant status. This allows the pigs that the producer has invested in to be healthier and more likely to make it to market (Alltech-Zhejiang University Animal Nutrition and Feed Science Research Alliance).

He asked how long this process took, and I responded with something to the effect of, “Several very labor-intensive hours.” His reply was, “Wow, so how often do they need to be cleaned?” I looked at him in astonishment and said, “Every day.” He was baffled. Such is the equestrian life. If you’re anything like me, however, you’re always looking for ways to work smarter, not harder. Below, I’ve compiled a few suggestions to help make stall-cleaning both faster and easier. 1. Invest in good-quality, thick, rubber stall mats. Yes, they are expensive and can be a pain to install, but they will change your life. They provide a smooth base for more efficient cleaning, are non-absorbent and easy to disinfect. They can also significantly reduce the amount of bedding needed, which can be a real cost savings. Thick mats also provide cushioning for horses’ legs and feet, which is especially helpful for arthritic horses or those prone to founder or laminitis. And perhaps the best bonus is that they can also help your horse stay cleaner. 2. Choose your bedding wisely. Straw and coarse shavings can be a real nightmare to comb through and can significantly increase the amount of time spent cleaning a stall. Finer bedding — such as small wood shavings, wood pellets or even paper shavings — is an excellent option. You will need to carefully consider just how much bedding to use (as previously mentioned, mats can help). If you overbed, you’ll spend a lot more time cleaning and, depending on the type of bedding, you will also face an increased potential for exposure to dust, molds and allergens, which can intensify the risk of respiratory disorders, such as heaves. On the other hand, inadequate bedding or failure to clean stalls thoroughly enough will increase your risk of incurring problems linked to air quality, at the very least. If you can smell ammonia in the barn, you should reconsider both the amount of bedding being used and your stall-cleaning tactics. 3. Consider using a bedding conditioner/drying agent. Bedding that has a high moisture content can really hold onto ammonia, especially when combined with humid air, and this can cause respiratory distress in horses. A lot of people think that good old-fashioned barn lime is the answer, but it does nothing to actually eliminate odors — it simply covers them up. NaturClean is a unique dry powder bedding conditioner and drying agent for all animal species. This blend of ultra-absorbent mineral compounds is designed to keep bedding dry, thus reducing the potential for bacterial infection. NaturClean also helps reduce ammonia levels and odors, thereby improving the overall atmosphere of the housing system. It is safe to handle and does not cling to animal coats. 4. Pick stalls often. Taking even a few minutes to pick your horse’s stall before you leave each night can make mucking out a much easier task the following day — and will also keep your horse happier, healthier and cleaner. Additionally, it helps cut back on odors and flies. This method is particularly effective for horses who are a bit restless in stalls and tend to grind manure into the bedding. 5. Extend turnout time. The less time your horses spend indoors, the less time you will have to spend cleaning up after them. Regular turnout provides a multitude of other benefits as well. Though equine field antics — like bucking, kicking, rolling, snorting and whinnying — may seem potentially worrisome to owners (who are crossing our fingers that our horses don’t hurt themselves), these natural movements actually help to stretch sore, tight muscles, re-align the spine and support the clearing of dust from the respiratory system. Healthier digestion is another benefit of more time outdoors, as continued movement allows the stomach to produce less gastric acid, which can decrease the risk of gastric ulcer development. Benjamin Franklin famously said, “In this world, nothing can be said to be certain except death and taxes.” We can safely assume that, as a gentleman of the 18th century and former postmaster general, Franklin likely owned horses. Therefore, I think a truer statement might have included an add-on regarding stall-cleaning, don’t you? I want to learn more about equine management recommendations.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/stall-cleaning-success-5-tips-horse-owners","title":"\n\n                    Stall-cleaning success: 5 tips for horse owners\n                    ","date":"May 15, 2019","contentLength":749}},{"pageContent":"One of the primary goals of all livestock producers is to keep their herds healthy. Unfortunately, however, illness is often unavoidable — and some very easily transmitted but deadly ailments can be traced back to one source: Clostridium. What is Clostridium, and how do you know when it is causing problems in your herd? Clostridia are gram-positive, anaerobic, spore-forming bacteria that are often found in the soil and manure or in feedstuffs that have been contaminated. “It’s around us all the time, everywhere,” said Dr. Luke Miller, a veterinary elite dairy advisor at Alltech. “Because it’s a spore former, soil contamination caused by clostridia can last through the winter. It can last in the desert, during heat stress, cold stress — all that stuff has very little effect on clostridia.” Unlike many other disease-causing bacteria, clostridia are not contagious or passed from animal to animal. “There’s pretty much two ways you’re going to get a Clostridium infection,” said Luke. “You’re going to get it through either ingesting contaminated food or through a cut, an open wound or something like that. There’s always some insult that has to occur for a clostridial infection to flourish.” It is possible for an animal to ingest clostridia and not be affected, as spores can lay dormant in the intestine. Clostridia become pathogenic when something about the animal’s diet, habitat or body changes — if the animal eats too much starch or carbohydrates, for example, or experiences a tissue injury, either internal (e.g., liver abscesses) or external (e.g., cuts or gashes). These issues — namely, a decrease in or lack of oxygen within the tissue — create favorable conditions for the proliferation of this bacteria. Homing in on Clostridium perfringens There are numerous types of clostridial bacteria, but cattle producers should be specifically concerned about Clostridium perfringens, which can have a major impact on an animal’s gut health — especially young animals, including calves that are less than 2 months old, because they have not yet developed a fully functioning rumen or a complete gut flora. C. perfringens lives on starches and sugars, which explains why it proliferates when cattle start eating more carbohydrates. It can also spread when the animal experiences stress or is dealing with another condition that affects the gut, such as diarrhea. When elevated levels of the toxins released by C. perfringens enter the bloodstream — including alpha toxin, which is highly virulent — animals can experience inflammation, shock, cardiac arrest and even death. What are the symptoms of clostridial disease in cattle? Clostridium can lead to gut distress in cattle — especially when they are specifically dealing with C. perfringens, which can lead to symptoms and issues that include: Enterotoxemia (also known as purple gut; when toxins from bacteria that are usually found in the intestine enter the bloodstream) Severe diarrhea/stomach upset Abdominal pain Bloat Decreased appetite/intestinal movement Abomasum distention Leaky gut Bubbles in the manure Hemorrhagic bowel syndrome (HBS) Stalled calves ADR (“ain’t doin’ right”) — general malaise, etc. Blindness Sudden death How can clostridial infections be prevented or defeated? While it can be difficult to treat enteric diseases in cattle, including infections caused by C. perfringens, it is not impossible. Learn more about the various ways you can protect your animals against dangerous clostridia below. 1. Work with your vet to implement a vaccine protocol Consult with your veterinarian about creating a proper vaccination program for your herd, as vaccines can help protect against some of the most common clostridial diseases in cattle, including enterotoxemia, blackleg, redwater and tetanus. “There are many kinds and brands of vaccines for Clostridium,” said Miller. “Meet with your veterinarian to decide a proper vaccination protocol that addresses your operation’s needs and takes into account your regional pathogen load and issues.” Miller also recommends being as proactive as possible about making sure your other cattle don’t contract clostridia once it has been identified in a member of the herd. After all, while clostridia can’t be transmitted from animal to animal, if the entire herd is eating the same contaminated feed or is walking on contaminated soil, more instances of infection are likely to crop up. 2. Help the gut microbiome flourish by feeding probiotics As defined by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), probiotics are live microorganisms that can provide health benefits by helping digest food, destroying disease-causing cells and producing vitamins. Some of the microorganisms contained in probiotics are similar to — or even the same as — microorganisms that live naturally in the bodies of humans and animals. As such, probiotics help “complement the gut biome,” in Miller’s words, making it more robust and bolstering its ability to fight off colonization by detrimental bacteria like C. perfringens. “You can get colonization with good bacteria every day with probiotics, and they simply out-eat the competition for nutrients,” said Miller. “When they eat more starch, the Clostridium won’t be able to. They’re keeping the pH where they like it, not where the Clostridium likes it.” 3. Keep the gut healthy with products like Select BAC™ While the methods mentioned above can help protect against clostridial diseases in cattle, some intestinal issues caused by C. perfringens are not addressed by vaccines and/or probiotics. Select BAC™, a new product offering from Alltech, serves as a great nutritional solution for helping solve the problems created by Clostridium. This complete gut health pack includes both enzymes and probiotics, which play a pivotal role in maintaining the health of the gut. “We’re throwing in the whole kitchen sink of what science thinks is good for the gut in Select BAC,” Miller said. “We’re helping you heal your herd’s gut.” Clostridium is nearly impossible to avoid, and the effects it can have on cattle herds are difficult to grasp. Fortunately, a variety of Clostridium perfringens treatments and methods of prevention are available, including establishing a vaccination program and feeding probiotics and enzymes. Hopefully, by utilizing these techniques, producers can begin to feel more at ease about the health of their herds.

Providing for the basic needs of young pigs can go a long way in promoting health, efficient growth and a successful nursery program. Feed: Getting young pigs started right Feed intake is crucial for a newly weaned pig. Weaning is a stressful time for the young pig due to a myriad of factors, including maternal separation, changes to their environment, transportation stress, establishment of a social hierarchy, abrupt diet changes, vaccinations and exposure to pathogens. Health is a huge factor at this stage of life, so providing weaned piglets with the proper nutrition to help them transition from milk to dry feed is critical. Below are some feeding strategies that can help improve the post-wean transition, increasing the likelihood that the pig will thrive. Feed quality Providing pigs with high-quality feeds requires taking many steps along the production chain. It starts with ingredients that have a high nutrient value and are free of contaminants. The processing, delivery and storage of the diet can also affect the quality and final composition of the feed. Understanding the factors that affect feed quality and implementing a quality-assurance program will help ensure that the best possible nutrition is delivered to the pigs. Feeder adjustment The proper adjustment of feeders is a labor- and time-intensive task. It is, however, essential in that it not only helps maximize feed intake but also helps reduce feed wastage, especially during the nursery period, when diets are expensive. To maximize feed intake, young pigs must be able to easily access the feeder. The feeder must be open and easy to find so that pigs have unrestricted access to it. Based on practical experience, the generally recommended steps are, first, to close the feeder adjustment gate and fill the feeders with the first starter pellet, and then to adjust the gates to be the proper height while slightly shaking or tapping the feeder. During the first week post-weaning, allowing 2/3 of the feeder pan to be covered with feed ensures that the pigs are attracted to the feed. In the following weeks of the nursery period, target 1/2 of the feeder pan to be covered with feed will ensure minimal feed wastage. Mat feeding The biggest opportunity to boost growth and support livability/health is by increasing intakes during the first 7 to 10 days post-weaning. What do you feed pigs after weaning? The transition from a sow’s 20–24 lactation events per day to an ad-lib environment sometimes challenges the young pig’s feed intake. The goal of mat feeding is to stimulate the activity level of the pigs and act as a “dinner bell” signifying that it’s time to eat. Walking pens and mat feeding four times per day will provide the best results. Mat feed 1 pound of feed (0.5 kg) per 40 pigs per feeding, but no more than what they will clean up in 15 minutes. A 1-pint scoop works better than a larger scoop in terms of providing the accurate amount and reducing wastage. Gruel feeding Similar to mat feeding, gruel feeding helps to boost growth and support the livability and health of small and sick/starve-out pigs, which struggle to make the switch to dry feed post-weaning, helping nursery pigs transition from sow milk to feed. Gruel is a mixture of dry feed ingredients mixed with water or other liquid products, such as milk replacers, that is designed to increase intake. In the case of small piglets or piglets with a slow growth, it is recommended to use pre-starters, a milk replacer or rolled oats; for normal piglets, pre-starter feed may be used. The proportion of water to feed is slowly reduced so the piglets can adapt to the consumption of increasingly more solid feed. To make gruel, mix one part dry feed with two parts water/liquid. The consistency of the gruel should be similar to that of oatmeal. Keep in mind that, in the winter, it is better to use lukewarm water. Remember that gruel pans should be placed away from the sleeping area to keep pigs dry. Water: The forgotten nutrient The quality of water and the amount consumed are extremely important aspects of pig production, but unfortunately, they are also often overlooked. Pigs that don’t drink enough water won’t consume enough feed. Daily water usage is a good indicator of pig health. When your pig’s water consumption drops for three continuous days or drops by more than 30% in one day, this may indicate that they are potentially experiencing a health challenge. To encourage young pigs to drink, it is best to provide water in open cube drinkers, poultry drinkers or water bowls for the first 3 to 4 days after weaning. If nipple drinkers are the only source of water, it may take young pigs up to 24 hours to drink an adequate amount, and if the drinkers are not functioning correctly, some pigs may never get enough. The general recommendation is to limit water pressure to 20 psi in drinking supply lines. Adding acidifiers, such as Acid-Pak 4-Way®, to drinking water optimizes pH levels and maintains water balance, helping promote water intake, especially when intake is low or variable. Water drinking requirements Outlined below are guidelines for the proper drinker height, flow rate and daily water consumption for wean-to-finish pigs. Pig weight <12 lbs. 12–30 lbs. 30–75 lbs. 75–150 lbs. 150–market Nipple height (in) 4 to 6 6 to 12 12 to 18 18 to 24 24 to 30 Pigs/nipple 10 10 10 12 to 15 12 to 15 Flow rate (cups/min) 2/3 1 1 ½ 2 3 Daily intake (qt.) 0.2 to 0.5 2 to 4 4-6 (1–1 ½ gal) 5 to 10 (1 1½ –2 ½ gal) 6 to 18 (1 ½ –4 1/2 gal) Managing barn environment Environmental controls in pig housing are important for animal growth and health. Modern farms have computer-controlled systems that are adjusted automatically to optimize the environment depending on the stage of growth or reproduction, based on ideal temperature curves established by research and models. For example, for growing pigs, the temperature needs to decrease by set amounts as the pigs increase in body weight. However, it is important to ensure that the correct growth curve is selected in any automated system to account for the breed, age and health of the animals. It takes several days for newly weaned pigs to adjust to their new surroundings and the new supply of water and feed, and feed intake may drop during this crucial time. Weaned pigs require a warm environment, between 85–89°F, depending on the weight or health of the pigs. Seeing pigs laid out next to each other is a sign that they are comfortable, neither too cold nor too hot. If pigs are spread out, it could be a sign that they are too hot. If they’re piling up on each other too deeply, then it could it be a sign that they are too cold. Although computer-controlled systems are very useful, management by barn workers, who can make suitable adjustments regarding changes in temperature regulation, is still key to ensuring the growth and health of the pigs.

Humidity control It is critical that the humidity remains below 65%. Warm and dry mats PIC generally recommends 2 CFM/pig at placement; however, in the case of PRRS-positive pigs, it may be necessary to remove air at a higher exhaustion rate to achieve less than 65% humidity. Brooders should produce temperatures around 95°F directly beneath themselves. Pigs should remain warm, dry and comfortable. To accomplish this, use properly functioning brooders and ample mat space (0.4 sq. ft/pig). If mats become wet or caked with feed or manure, flip the mats over to regain a dry, black surface that effectively absorbs heat. Mat temperatures may need to extend beyond 95°F to keep pigs comfortable. Brooders should be in place and functional for 14–21 days, depending on pig comfort and the severity of the disease. Brooders should be in place within intensive-care pens throughout the grueling period. Animal care Pen walking Conducting daily walk-throughs is an important task that all barn workers should make a part of their routine. Pig nursery pens should be walked daily to: Look in each feeder to ensure that the feeder has the proper amount of feed and is clean. Look in the trough of each feeder to ensure that the feeder is adjusted correctly and that there is the correct amount of pan coverage. Inspect the floor of the pens for excessive wetness, accumulation of manure and signs of diarrhea. Inspect each pen for damaged or bent rods that could injure pigs by sticking out into the pen. View every pig from snout to tail, head to toe; the rule of thumb is to spend 2 seconds per pig. Identify and pull fall-behinds. Identify, pull and treat sick pigs. Check water flow rates. Mat feed. Individual animal care Starting weaned pigs is the most critical task in a nursery barn. Unless they are presented with significant health challenges, pigs that start well tend to experience rapid growth and improved feed conversion. Unfortunately, the opposite is true in pigs that start tough, who tend to be a challenge all the way to marketing. One of the most common challenges in hard-starting weaned pigs is identifying sick pigs vs. starve-out pigs. Medications are beneficial for sick pigs but do not provide calories to starve-out pigs. Correctly identifying the root cause will allow for proper management. When walking through the barn, it is critical to keep an eye out for symptoms that could be signs of diseases or nutrition issues. Look at hair coat and/or color; a young pig’s hair coat gets coarse and dirtier when the pig is not feeling well. If a pig looks gaunt or redder in color, it could mean that it hasn’t been eating or drinking. Check for signs of respiratory diseases, which include coughing, breathing heavily (thumping), open-mouthed breathing and depression. Keep an eye out for pigs with red butts or diarrhea/scours, which is commonly seen in thin pigs. Sick and/or starve-out pigs should be placed into a fallback pen, as this is a lower-stress environment and will allow them to be treated accordingly. Watch for signs of lost body condition score, such as a visible spine, hip bones or ribs. Check for gut fill and identify pigs that have sunken-in flanks. Hold the pig upside down by its back legs, placing your thumb over the pig’s back and your fingers over the pig’s abdomen, squeezing your fingers toward your thumb to evaluate gut fill. If your fingers easily depress the abdomen, the pig is off feed. If abdomen is full, with plenty of resistance, feed intake is adequate. A pig never gets over a good — or bad — start, so it’s on us, as animal caretakers, to provide the proper environment and nutrition for our young piglets to get off to the right start, setting the stage for their success.

Performance problems? Must be ulcers. Attitude issues? Probably ulcers. Poor appetite? Have you checked for ulcers? You get the idea. Equine gastric ulcer syndrome (EGUS) is a frustrating and potentially costly issue — gastroscopy (an endoscopic examination of a horse’s stomach) and treatment with omeprazole can cost upwards of $1,500. And the craziest thing of all? Ulcers are an entirely man-made problem; we have interrupted the horse’s natural environment and feeding/grazing regimen out of our own need for routine and convenience. Each of the following causes can lead you straight into Ulcerville, a place we would all much prefer to avoid: Stall confinement Prescribed meal times High-grain diets Increased training demands Competition Environmental changes, including travel, moving to a new barn or a change in herd dynamics Treating the unknown Gastric ulcers are extremely common in performance horses — it is estimated that as many as 90 percent of racehorses and 70 percent of show horses have them. This problem, however, is not as black and white as it may seem. While some might think that the solution is as simple as skipping the expensive endoscopy and diving into treatment, just wait until the cost of medicine rears its ugly head; those tubes of omeprazole aren’t cheap, especially when you need 28 days’ worth. As someone who was most certainly not born with a silver spoon in her mouth, I can totally relate. You may have heard that powdered omeprazole is much cheaper, or that OTC rantidine (think Zantac®) can solve your horse’s problems for less, but the old adage that “you get what you pay for” is particularly fitting in this situation. Let’s look at this from another angle: would you take medicine — a really expensive type — for something you weren’t even sure you actually had? Sounds insane, right? If you think your horse has gastric ulcers, call your vet to schedule a gastroscopy; it’s the only way to make a definitive diagnosis. Prevention over cure Did you know that Benjamin Franklin was actually talking about fire safety when he said, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure”? Still, his wisdom applies. Making a few relatively simple adjustments to your horse’s lifestyle and feeding schedule can greatly reduce its risk of ulcer development. 1. Feed forage wisely. Horses are very large animals, but their stomachs only have a 2- to 4-gallon capacity. This may sound surprisingly small in relation to their size, but horses are built to spend two-thirds of their time grazing, as this allows them to digest a small but steady amount of forage throughout the day. Large amounts of saliva are produced during grazing, and when this saliva is combined with roughage, it can buffer the acid levels in the stomach. Even when a horse isn’t eating, its stomach is producing acid, and this is why prescribed meal times (e.g., feeding only twice per day) can be problematic: the longer a horse goes between forage consumption, the more acid accumulates. Feeding free-choice hay or allowing for extended turnout keeps a steady supply of buffering saliva available to neutralize stomach acid. Offering hay in a slow feeder can also help meals last longer. Alternatively, you may mimic grazing by breaking down daily rations into smaller, more frequent meals. Alfalfa often gets a bad rap, but it is actually thought to have a better buffering effect on stomach acids than grass hay. Alfalfa is far more nutrient-dense than grass hay, though, so it will need to be introduced to the diet gradually to reduce the risk of gastrointestinal upset. 2. Limit grain. Horses produce less saliva when they consume grain, limiting the buffering effect that otherwise takes place when they consume forages. Grain and other concentrates increase blood glucose, which, in turn, increases insulin levels and volatile fatty acid production and could potentially damage the stomach lining. If your horse needs more calories outside of forage, look for a feed that has a lower starch and sugar content and is higher in fat and fiber. You will often see these diets referred to as low-NSC (non-structural carbohydrate). While non-structural carbohydrates are an important source of energy for performance horses who don’t have metabolic issues, they must be provided in the appropriate balance to avoid negative impacts and support optimal performance. 3. Remember: we are dealing with creatures of habit. Humans aren’t the only ones who like routines. Anything out of the ordinary that adds stress to your horse’s life can contribute to the development of ulcers. This doesn’t just apply to show horses; even changing up the turnout group at home or feeding an hour later than usual can throw your horse into inner turmoil. Do your best to introduce change gradually and maintain as many familiar habits as possible. If introducing stress is unavoidable, take precautionary measures like feeding a well-researched gastric support product and/or strategically administering omeprazole. 4. Provide more turnout time. As previously mentioned, horses are designed to be eating — and moving — almost constantly. As also noted, our interruption of this habit has led to the problems addressed in this article. Horses are among the most frustratingly fragile creatures on the planet, but don’t let a fear of pasture injury keep you from letting your horse be a horse. Provide ample turnout time — 24/7 is ideal, but this might not be realistic for many horses, so aim for as many hours per day as is reasonably possible. It’s also important to turn your horse out into a group, if you can. We need to remember that horses are very social creatures, who generally find solace in the company of other equines. 5. Be careful with medication. When used long-term or in high amounts, some medications — particularly nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as Bute (phenylbutazone) or Banamine — can damage the lining of the stomach, thereby increasing ulcer risk. Always check with your vet if you have any questions about the recommended use and dosage rate for these types of medication. Ulcers may seem mysterious — and, in a lot of ways, they are. If we observe ulcer symptoms, we must ultimately trust our instincts, since there is no way to know exactly how much pain they cause our horses. Fortunately, as with many things, advances in equine medicine and management will only continue to develop our understanding of what we can do to both treat and prevent this common but distressing ailment.

The world’s precious soil hosts more than a quarter of the planet’s biodiversity. “However, as soils are continually treated with pesticides and fungicides, hundreds of ecosystems and billions of microbes are being destroyed,” said Robert Walker, global general manager for Alltech Crop Science, at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference. This leads to imbalances that destroy crops, sometimes not just for a season, but for the foreseeable future. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 20 to 25 percent of soils worldwide have already been degraded through modern agriculture practices. In fact, an additional area the size of Austria is degraded each year.1 The world’s growing population, with an increasing demand for food production, has brought new attention to soil degradation. “Unless new approaches are adopted, the global amount of arable and productive land per person in 2050 will be only a quarter of the level that was available in 1960,” said Walker, citing the FAO report. Time is of the essence in finding new solutions, as it takes 1,000 years for 3 centimeters of new topsoil to be generated. Where can answers be found for application today? Walker sees opportunities in organic farming, precision agriculture and beneath our feet, in the soil itself. Answers rooted in the soil: Microbes at work “Proper soil nutrition should be our first line of defense,” said Walker on the topic of saving the soil and helping producers increase their crop production. “Only 2 percent of all microbes in soil have been identified. What if we were to harness the other unidentified 98 percent?” Microbes can help support plant health in the following ways: Increasing nutrient availability Enhancing root growth Neutralizing toxic compounds in soils Providing disease suppression Increasing plant immunity and boosting resistance against environmental extremes One success story can be found in Costa Rica, where microbial technology is being successfully deployed to help banana producers fight disease and reduce the use of synthetic fungicides. By incorporating new microbial technologies with soil management methods such as conservation tillage, producers have ONE big opportunity, Walker predicts. While synthetic chemistries have helped with feeding a growing population, weed resistance and limited productivity challenge current systems. “It’s time to develop a new system of agriculture based on natural principles for crop and soil health and productivity,” said Walker. An additional benefit of integrating microbial technology with conservation tillage applies to water use. “With each 1 percent increase in organic matter, there is the ability for the soil to hold an additional 20,000 gallons of water per acre,” concluded Walker. He encourages producers worldwide to adopt ONE new technology to conserve soil vitality.

The critical task of top turf management literally starts at the ground level, taking into account plant health and protection. “Turfgrass health and uniformity all start with nutrition,” said Kwame Duffy, Alltech Crop Science sales manager. Duffy has been working with several turf managers to incorporate natural biological products into their management programs. Nitrogen and potassium are two key components for high-quality turf. Turfgrass diseases can stem from either excessive or low levels of nitrogen as well as climate conditions that could be favorable to disease development. Having the ability to adjust nutritional imbalances directly and on an as-needed basis can provide the ability to combat turf disease. By maintaining a healthy nutritional balance through the addition of biologicals, the potential for pest and disease pressure can be inhibited. Foliar nutrient applications and slow release nitrogen can provide for healthy plant growth. Duffy gave an example with bentgrass. “Bentgrass can be tricky to maintain, especially for courses located in the southern states,” he said. During the recent hot months, bentgrass would normally be stressed. On a golf course that recently incorporated biologicals, the grass grew well and established new roots during June and July, said Duffy. “The turf was 10 times healthier than if it had been untreated,” he said. Pesticide use was cut by 30–40 percent and fungicide use was cut in half. “It’s pretty impressive,” stated Duffy. “The addition of biologicals helped the plants defend themselves naturally. It’s the only thing the golf course superintendents did differently, and they are getting these great results.” In the future, Duffy believes some of the courses may be able to completely eliminate fungicides because of the results they are seeing. Strategies for a future with increasing pesticide regulation “The most important shot in golf is the next one.” – Ben Hogan The turf industry is facing a future similar to that of the agriculture industry, with increasing regulation regarding pesticide use. Natural biologicals to protect turf from pests and disease will play a key role in this future. “With these new management programs, we’ve seen more efficient application and a complete redirect of every dollar spent toward improved disease resistance,” said Duffy. Ultimately, golf course superintendents are managing all course inputs for the best return on their investment, whether their budget is $30,000, $200,000 or $1 million, he said. The importance of finding the best turf management strategies can’t be downplayed. “Your horticulture practices are key to whether you have a golf course or not,” said Duffy.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/setting-course","title":"\n\n                    Setting the course\n                    ","date":"March 7, 2018","contentLength":437}},{"pageContent":"Dietary trace minerals like copper, zinc and manganese are nutrients critical to animal health, performance and welfare. Immunity, reproduction, growth and even meat and milk quality hinge on optimal trace mineral nutrition. Everything we know about trace mineral nutrition, from inclusion levels to effects on performance, has come from studies using inorganic trace mineral salts. Trace mineral salts are made from a trace mineral loosely bound to a charged ion and have been the basis of trace mineral supplementation and research since the 1930s. Recent studies, however, are using a different form of trace mineral, and the results of those studies are challenging ideas once considered fundamental to livestock nutrition. In the early 1990s, organic trace minerals were first developed to reflect the way trace minerals naturally occur in plants. These supplements have a protein-like or carbohydrate ring structure that attaches to the trace mineral at multiple sites. The protein or carbohydrate component serves as a protective, stable delivery system, increasing the likelihood of mineral absorption. The last 20 years of research confirm that the difference between a mineral salt and a trace mineral bound to a stable organic ring are substantial. The evidence points to organics as a superior source of trace minerals, but beyond that, we see unprecedented effects in the animal when they receive optimally formulated minerals. Organic trace minerals are changing the way we look at livestock nutrition overall. Below are seven major changes to nutritional dogma instigated by studies looking at organic trace minerals. While many nutritionists still cling to the low-priced, traditional inorganics, organic trace minerals are fostering a revolution in animal feeding. 1. Not all trace mineral forms are created equal Historically, inorganic trace minerals have been the primary form of mineral supplementation. Their inexpensive synthesis, however, produces a supplement that quickly dissociates and reacts within the feed and digestive tract. Dr. Richard Murphy is a biochemist and research director in Dunboyne, Ireland, who has focused much of his work on characterizing, comparing and optimizing trace mineral supplements. \"When comparing mineral products — both inorganic and organic — the key differentiation point is to understand their stability through the GI tract,\" said Murphy. \"Stability at the acidic pH found in the gastric environment is critical to ensuring maximal delivery of mineral to sites of mineral absorption in the intestine.\" Dr. Murphy's work has repeatedly shown that organic trace minerals are far superior to traditional inorganic trace minerals in both stability and overall bioavailability. They are, in fact, so much more efficient that countless animal trials have shown that organic trace minerals can be fed at significantly lower levels than their inorganic counterpart without disrupting health and performance. Surprisingly, Dr. Murphy's research has also found that not all organic trace minerals are created equal. \"Ultimately, the type and position of the amino acids used in organic trace minerals are critical for stability,\" said Dr. Murphy. Different brands of organic trace minerals use different amino acid and peptide strands, some with far weaker associations and lower stability than others. Dr. Murphy and his research associates have developed a peptide-trace mineral configuration for use in organic trace minerals that provides optimal stability. It is, in fact, his work in differentiating organic and inorganic trace minerals that has laid the foundation for the six other breakthroughs in mineral nutrition. 2. Inorganics: Not required The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM) publishes livestock requirements for all essential nutrients, among which it lists inorganic trace minerals. New research, however, proves that, while trace minerals are essential, there is no absolute requirement for inorganic trace minerals. In fact, eliminating inorganics altogether and replacing them with organic trace minerals appears to enhance performance. In beef cattle, a total replacement of inorganic trace minerals with lower levels (60 percent) of organic trace minerals improved health and performance and generated a $50/head advantage (Holder et al., 2016). Total replacement with organic trace minerals in pigs improved average daily gain, increased slaughter weight by 2 kg and improved slaughter efficiency to generate a savings of $1.80 per pig. Inorganics may prevent deficiency, but there are far more effective supplement options. Even operations feeding a combination of inorganic and organic trace minerals stand to benefit from converting to 100 percent organic trace minerals. The total replacement of inorganics offers the best results in achieving animal genetic potential. 3. Organic trace mineral bioavailability: using less to do more Studies routinely feed organic trace minerals at levels 30-50 percent lower than inorganics because the superior delivery system of organics allows them to be more efficiently absorbed. Poultry scientists at the University of Kentucky asked, \"Just how much more efficiently?\" In their study, broilers were fed organic trace minerals at levels 75 percent lower than commercial levels for inorganics. These birds reached a desirable market weight in the standard six-week period and showed no signs of deficiency or disease, even though they were fed only one-quarter the mineral ration of their inorganic-fed counterparts (Ao et al., 2009). These relative concentrations are below those traditionally recognized as needed for meeting the birds’ requirements. Organic trace minerals are more effectively absorbed and deposited in the intended tissues, so small amounts can have a greater impact. The inefficiency of inorganics requires producers to significantly overfeed them. Organic trace minerals offer a way for producers to maximize resources. This research also gives us a clearer picture of what an animal's true trace mineral requirements might be. 4. Organic trace minerals contribute to significant improvements in animal health Trace minerals have a lock-and-key effect on certain antioxidant enzymes that are critical to immune function. A sufficient supply of trace minerals can be described as the sustaining fuel of the immune system. Recent feeding trials and nutrigenomic studies showcase organic minerals taking on some of agriculture’s most costly diseases. In feedlot cattle, a total replacement of inorganic trace minerals with lower levels of organic trace minerals (60 percent of commercial levels for inorganics) was able to reduce mortality by 57 percent and mortality due to bovine respiratory disease (BRD) by 69 percent. Even in the cattle contracting BRD, the number of retreats was significantly reduced with organic trace minerals (Holder et al., 2016). Too good to be true? A separate study conducted on a different continent confirmed the effects: organic trace mineral groups showed a 7.7 percent decrease in even the incidence of BRD (Sgoifo Rossi et al., 2018). \"BRD costs the U.S. beef industry upwards of $800 million and is the greatest concern and cause of loss at the feed yard,” said Dr. Vaughn Holder, lead beef researcher at Alltech. “Organic trace minerals provide a new reinforcement to the animals’ first line of defense and add tremendously to the producer’s peace of mind.\" In poultry, necrotic enteritis (NE) brings devastating costs, approaching $6 billion annually with mortality rates of 1 percent per day. Organic trace minerals eliminated bird death due to NE, reducing mortality by 12 percent compared to inorganics (He et al., 2017; Bortoluzzi et al., 2017). Birds on organic trace minerals also showed significant positive changes to the expression of genes related to improved disease resistance. From gene expression to disease markers and mortality, there is mounting evidence that the bioavailability of organic minerals better equips animals to take on and survive disease challenges. 5. Organic trace minerals lead to extended shelf life and improved meat quality The impact of organic trace minerals spans the entire food chain, all the way to our own refrigerators. Animal nutrition directly affects meat quality, as feeding organic trace minerals results in meat that lasts longer and tastes juicier. \"Trace minerals are essential to antioxidant enzymes in the meat,\" said Dr. Rebecca Delles, an Alltech meat scientist. \"By providing a trace mineral source that is more bioavailable, those antioxidants have a better mineral supply to sustain their activity.\" Proving her point, beef from steers that were fed organic trace minerals showed increased antioxidant activity, which led to extended shelf life (Sgoifo Rossi et al., 2018). That same meat also showed increased water retention, which improves profitability and texture. Dr. Delles found that organic trace minerals had the same effect in pork loin and chicken breast, beneficially improving both sensory experience and the producer’s bottom line (Delles et al., 2014; Delles et al., 2016). \"The average amount of time it takes a consumer to recover from a bad meat purchase is three months,” said Dr. Delles. “If the appearance, flavor or texture is perceived as being low quality, it will be another three months before the customer reconsiders purchasing that meat product. In fresh pork, if only 5 percent of U.S. consumers have a bad meat experience, that could still bring a projected loss of 3 percent — or $181,938,556.80 — over the course of 12 weeks due to what might seem like 'just color or texture.'\" 6. More efficient organic trace minerals decrease the environmental impact of livestock Bioavailable organic trace minerals are the exclusive method of sustaining animal performance while simultaneously lowering environmental impact. The instability of inorganic minerals makes them difficult for the animal to absorb. This often leads to overfeeding of trace minerals and, therefore, excretion of large quantities of minerals back into the environment. These excreted minerals alter what is known as a “mineral footprint” and contribute to soil and water contamination. The improved bioavailability allowing lower inclusion rates of organic trace minerals has been found to directly reduce the mineral footprint of livestock. A series of trials conducted by agriculture institutions across China in 2017 found that in swine, poultry and ruminants, organic trace minerals could be fed at substantially lower quantities than inorganics and yield the same performance — but return much lower mineral excretion. The same was not true for inorganics: while low levels of inorganics also reduced mineral excretion, they were detrimental to animal health and reduced performance (Guo et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2018; Qui et al., 2018). \"This type of research changes the way we study animal nutrition,” said Dr. Karl Dawson, ruminant microbiologist and chief scientific officer at Alltech. “These are the solutions we need to sustainably feed our growing populations — benefitting all stakeholders while decreasing the environmental impact of intensive animal production systems.\" 7. Optimal organic trace mineral nutrition improves herd health, reproduction and performance for multiple generations Trace minerals have a multigenerational effect. Like other nutrients, trace minerals change gene expression, effectively turning genes on or off, up or down. Those changes in gene expression are heritable — meaning the effects of a mother's nutrition, good or bad, are passed on to her offspring before they even take their first bite of feed. This phenomenon, known as epigenetics, gives producers and nutritionists the power to use nutrition to build their future herd. Dairy scientists at Pennsylvania State University studied a herd over three generations and found that heifer calves experienced 10 fewer days of sickness and came into estrus 26 days sooner when their dams were fed organic trace minerals (Gelsinger et al., 2016; Pino et al., 2018). This was true even for heifer calves who didn't consume organic trace minerals themselves, confirming that the effect was solely due to maternal nutrition. Fewer days of sickness are correlated to increased milk production later in life and reaching reproductive maturity almost one month sooner, which is worth approximately $100/head in management costs and a 2-3 percent decrease in carbon footprint. In beef cattle, calves born to cows fed organic trace minerals showed improved body weight through weaning and again at 205 days, regardless of their own diet (Price et al., 2017). Weaning is one of the most critical stress points in the beef life cycle — but organic trace minerals in utero allowed weaning and young calves to thrive despite their circumstances. While trace minerals can have an incredible impact on a single animal, results like these show potential for strategized feeding for the future herd. The advent of precision feeding From feed to fork, trace mineral source makes all the difference. Organic trace minerals provide livestock with an essential nutrient in an optimized form, and the effects of such precision reverberate throughout the entire food chain. With effects on animal health and welfare, producer livelihood, consumer preference and environmental protection, no stakeholder is overlooked. This is the advent of a revolution in precision feeding. Well-timed, optimally designed nutrients can reveal to us an animal's real requirements and allow them to achieve their true genetic potential, so that we can build better herds and feed a growing population.

Alonna Wright hopes to find a cure that can stop the menace and keep farmers around the U.S. happy. Wright, a rising senior at the University of Kentucky (UK), won the 2016 undergraduate Alltech Young Scientist (AYS) award with her research on the biological control of agricultural pests. “Winning the AYS award was a very surreal experience, and one of the most memorable of my life,” said Wright. Wright said she entered the competition just hoping to get an honorable mention to put on a resume. She never imagined winning. “It means so much to me personally, but also to be able to share my research on a global platform and bring awareness to this problem, which costs our farmers billions of dollars in damage each year, is a privilege that some scientists may not ever be able to have, and one that I don't take for granted,” she said. Fighting corn earworm with a nudivirus Wright conducted her research at Paratechs, a privately held biotech company in Kentucky “Virology is a field that continues to captivate me with each new thing I learn about it,” she said. Virology is a branch of science that deals with the studies of viruses and viral diseases. According to Wright, viruses are very important to study and continue to study “in order to prevent harmful viruses and utilize the capabilities of other viruses to benefit the greater good.” Wright’s research specifically dealt with the Heliothis zea nudivirus. “This virus affects some populations of the corn earworm, or Helicoverpa zea, which is an agricultural pest that causes billions of dollars in damage to the crops they feed on; they feed on 123 known hosts,” she said. In nature, the virus causes approximately one-third of the corn earworm population to become sterile. “What we have done here at ParaTechs is we have mutated the virus to cause 100 percent sterility in the population,” said Wright. “My specific project was determining the interaction between those viruses, using a superinfection research model, to determine if the presence of the wild-type virus would prevent our mutant virus from causing the high rate of sterility that we expect,” continued Wright. “Our results showed that presence of the wild-type virus would not decrease the rate of sterility in the insects due to our mutant virus.” With this research, Wright hopes to market this mutant virus as a substitute to some pesticides used for corn earworm control and to supplement the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) plants that are currently on the market. What’s next for Wright Wright, who is an agricultural biotechnology student at the UK College of Agriculture, Food and Environment with minors in psychology and microbiology, believes agriculture is very important for the future. “Agriculture is a very prevalent field of study in America, especially in Kentucky,” said Wright. She believes that “home-grown” pride has brought agriculture back into the spotlight, and she encourages the younger generation to pursue a career in agriculture. Wright’s plans are to utilize the full funding that she received from Alltech as part of her AYS award to complete her Ph.D. in a genetics-related program. Afterward, she plans on working in the industry on cutting-edge technology to help advance agricultural products and techniques. Wright’s dream would be to work as a research scientist in a research company. “I really enjoy being in a lab and the thrill that molecular research can bring on a daily basis, and I'd love to be able to do what I enjoy every day when I go into work,” said Wright.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/combating-corn-earworm-leads-win-undergrad-researcher","title":"\n\n                    Combating corn earworm leads to a win for undergrad researcher\n                    ","date":"March 7, 2018","contentLength":620}},{"pageContent":"Regardless of the breed or discipline, a horse must have a good foundation on which to develop strong bones and joints. Nutrition of the growing horse has a great impact on this foundation. Several nutrients are particularly important in bone growth and development of the horse. Supply and balance of these nutrients is key to optimizing growth and minimizing nutritionally associated orthopedic problems. Whether the foal is a Thoroughbred destined to be the next Triple Crown contender, a Saddlebred aiming to be the next World Grand Champion or a pony that is a dream come true for a child, supplying sufficient nutrients in the proper balance will help foals develop a strong foundation. Energy and protein Optimal energy and protein balance are needed to support growth. As the horse matures, the growth rate changes; therefore, energy and protein requirements will also change. Energy is essential to growth and development. The quality of protein in the diet is also important. Crude protein in the diet is a measure of nitrogen and not an indication of protein quality. Protein quality is determined by the amino acid composition of the diet and the digestibility of the amino acids. Thus, the amino acid composition of the diet, rather than the crude protein content, is important to the growing horse. A steady growth rate can be obtained by avoiding excesses or deficiencies in either energy or protein and will help to reduce the incidence or severity of developmental orthopedic diseases (DOD). Excess dietary energy and protein If certain nutrients in the diet (vitamins and minerals) cannot support an increase in growth rate due to excess energy and protein, it may result in physitis, weak or brittle bones, increased risk for bucked shins, osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) and flexural deformities. Excess energy will also result in a fat horse. Excess dietary protein alone has not been found to cause bone development problems in horses; however, in practical situations, excess protein usually means excess energy also. Distinguishing between getting fat (body condition) and growing (growth rate) is essential. Both body weight and body condition should be monitored at least monthly and the feeding program adjusted as needed. Deficient dietary energy and protein Feeding deficient protein and energy will decrease growth rate and may lead to compensatory growth later when sufficient nutrients are available. If insufficient energy and protein are provided in the winter months (due to lack of feeding, poor quality hay, etc.), the growth rate will slow. In the spring, when pastures are lush and rich in calories and protein, a rapid increase in growth rate occurs. This rapid increase in growth is compensatory growth. It usually occurs post-weaning and may predispose the growing horse to DOD. In addition to decreased growth, protein deficiency may result in decreased feed intake (and therefore possible deficiencies in other nutrients) and decreased protein digestibility. Energy deficiency will also slow growth and may result in DOD. Minerals: Calcium and phosphorus Besides energy and protein, several minerals are important for proper bone and cartilage formation and development. Bone is approximately 35 percent calcium (Ca) and 14 percent to 17 percent phosphorus (P). Deficiencies in calcium and/or phosphorus can cause cartilage thickening, decreased growth rate and decreased bone density. While meeting calcium and phosphorus requirements are critical, the ratio in the diet is equally important. The safest ratio range should be maintained between 1:1 and 4:1 (Ca:P). A ratio above 4:1 (excess Ca) may decrease the absorption of other minerals, including iron, magnesium, manganese, phosphorus and zinc, thereby causing DOD. A ratio below 1:1 (excess P) may result in poor bone development, problems with cartilage growth and decreased calcium absorption, possibly leading to chronic calcium deficiency and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Minerals: Copper and zinc Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) are also essential for proper bone growth. Copper is necessary for synthesis of connective tissue, while bone contains intermediate concentrations of zinc. Deficiencies in copper result in DOD, and deficient dietary zinc decreases growth rate. In general, most forages and grains are slightly below a horse's requirements in copper but have only half a horse's requirement of zinc. Knowledgeable feed manufacturers will fortify their feeds to meet copper and zinc requirements when fed under average feeding practices. In practical terms, a horse's diet should have a Zn:Cu ratio ranging from 3:1 to 5:1. Excess zinc (>500 parts per million dry matter) may interfere with absorption of calcium and phosphorus and proper copper utilization, resulting in physitis, lameness and stiffness. Vitamins: A & D Vitamins, particularly A and D, are essential for normal growth and development. Beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, is high in green forages, such as pastures and well-cured hays. Horses must convert beta-carotene to vitamin A. Well-cured hays retain most vitamin A activity, but poor curing conditions (e.g., rain damage, long exposure to drying, etc.) will destroy beta-carotene. Vitamin A has many functions, including bone remodeling. Among other symptoms, excesses in vitamin A (>7,000 International Units per pound of dry matter) may cause weak bones. Excessively high intake can result when multiple supplements containing substantial amounts of vitamin A are fed. Vitamin A deficiency is not likely for horses consuming adequate green forage. However, horses given old or poor-quality hay and/or with very little grazing time may need vitamin A supplementation. Most commercial feeds and supplements contain more than adequate amounts of this vitamin. Deficiency in vitamin A will result in poor growth, but it has not been directly shown to cause bone problems in horses. Vitamin D promotes calcium and phosphorus absorption from the intestine, resorption of calcium from bone and reabsorption of calcium by the kidneys. Under sunlight, a substance in the skin is converted to a pre-vitamin form and eventually to an active form by the liver and kidneys, making deficiencies unlikely. Deficiencies may occur if horses are not exposed to direct sunlight and receive poorly cured hay. A deficiency could cause various bone abnormalities to develop. Excesses are also rare, but would be most common if certain members of the nightshade plant family are consumed. Symptoms of excess vitamin D intake would include bone abnormalities and calcification of blood vessels, the heart and other soft tissues. Summary The ultimate goal for growing horses is to achieve a steady growth rate and avoid orthopedic problems. This can be accomplished by supplying sufficient nutrients in the proper balance. Seasonal changes in pasture quality and individual body condition make it necessary to adjust the feeding program accordingly. If feed (grain) is reduced, mineral supplementation may be needed to make up for deficiencies.

Maintaining an optimal feed conversion ratio is now more important than ever, and managing costs is key to operating a successful and profitable fish farm. Reducing costs in an effort to maximize profits must be done cautiously, however, so as not to negatively impact the rate of progress — and some factors that seem relatively minor can actually have a dramatic impact on growth. My top five management tips for reducing costs on your farm are included below. 1. Provide a nutritionally balanced feed. It should come as no surprise that, generally, the operational element producers spend the most money on is feed. In fact, some farms report that feed constitutes as much as 50–70% of their operational costs. Although important, the cost per pound should not be the primary deciding factor when it comes to selecting feed; performance must also be considered. Using a subpar feed can actually be more costly in the long run, resulting in an unwanted increase to your feed conversion ratio (FCR). Based on the FCR, farms can improve the amount of feed necessary to produce one unit of meat. Lower-cost feed is often seen as the most efficient — but even if the feed cost per pound of fish or shrimp produced is lower, when you take the growth rate and other factors into account, the bottom line will be affected by the time the fish reaches market size. Evaluating feed performance by considering multiple characteristics is both efficient and practical. Some characteristics to consider include: Feed efficiency Growth rate Overall quality Digestibility Health and immune support Reduced medication costs Water quality maintenance The quality and integrity of the selected feed will vary for different species and stages of life. Formulating the feed correctly will help ensure the best results for both the animal and the farm. Determining the protein content is a simple and common way to evaluate feed quality — the higher, the better. 2. Support health. Providing feed that offers a good nutritional balance will directly impact both the FCR and the overall success of your farm. Vitamins and minerals must be added to the feed in order to create a nutritionally balanced and truly complete diet that will meet the basic nutritional requirements of fish and shrimp. Each species and stage of growth has specific nutritional needs, but a healthy gut is essential to achieving and maintaining optimal health for all fish and shrimp. The intestinal microflora, gut morphology, the immune system and nutrient uptake — as well as how each of these elements interact — all play a role in the health and performance of fish and shrimp. Mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS) are proven to influence gut health; however, different methods of fermentation, manufacturing and yeast strains can greatly impact functionality. Animals in farmed environments also require essential nutrients to meet their basic nutritional needs. Organic trace minerals are ideal because they are more bioavailable and better absorbed, stored and utilized by the animal than inorganics. Alltech has proven that organic trace minerals in the form of Bioplex® and Sel-Plex® can be included at significantly lower levels while still supporting animal performance, effectively optimizing animal mineral requirements and reducing their negative impact on the environment. 3. Maintain optimal water quality. Proper water quality maintenance is dependent on an understanding that the correct water quality and culture for fish and shrimp is absolutely essential. The ideal environmental conditions will vary among different species of fish and shrimp. Not maintaining these conditions could negatively affect growth and performance — and the risk for disease on the farm could potentially increase if the immune response declines. Using a nutritionally balanced, quality selection of raw materials in your aqua feed will result in higher palatability and digestibility and will be directly evident in the waste excreted by the fish and shrimp. Low feed digestibility will lead to increased protein and mineral excretion. This waste can contain potentially harmful amounts of nitrogen and ammonia, which can pollute the water and endanger both fish and shrimp. When selecting feed, pay closer attention to protein utilization than to protein content, as this can save both time and some of the labor costs associated with treating water and overall management. 4. Develop a best-practices management program. This is essential for achieving optimal farm performance. A well-implemented management program will support better feeding and biosecurity practices. Review feeding tables for accurate information on the frequency of feedings, feeding rates, ration sizes and timing. Communicate well with team members doing less technical work; this is crucial for successful implementation. Make them aware that both overfeeding and underfeeding can negatively impact the FCR — and that, alternately, accurate feed management can greatly improve farm results. Automated feeding technologies require an initial investment, but they actually help reduce labor costs over time and put an end to feeding practices that can contribute to poor water quality. The proper management practices mentioned above will also create greater opportunities for scaling. 5. Implement technology. Recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are a relatively recent innovation. Designing an RAS facility gives producers more control and allows for the heightened management of aquaculture systems. Having complete control over all of the elements of production helps ensure a stable environment, as well as a reduction in the stressful conditions that can impact and weaken the animal’s immune system. Choosing the correct feed is equally important with these types of systems. The mechanical filter in an RAS facility will remove large and firm feces. Producers should know, however, that providing a feed that is not suitable for this environment can result in the production of excess waste, reduced nutrient uptake and poor water quality. Profitability relies on optimized FCR. Fish are sensitive to several external factors, including fluctuating water temperatures, water quality and oxygen levels — all of which can impact growth and performance. Alltech Coppens is a leading developer and producer of fish feed. The Alltech Coppens team performs trials studying the digestibility of feed formulations to understand how raw materials interact with each other and affect certain characteristics.

Along with their penchant for finding bizarre ways to inflict bodily harm upon themselves, they are often prone to internal ailments, especially involving their digestive systems. Why is this? Different by design Horses are non-ruminant, monogastric (single-stomached) herbivores. The digestion of the horse is notable for several reasons. They are perhaps most well-known for their inability to vomit. But, have you ever thought much about how their digestive tract works? When a horse eats, portions of the feed are first digested enzymatically in the foregut. Afterward, microbial fermentation of other nutrients, like cellulose, occurs in the hindgut. The equine digestive system is truly unique because the first section resembles that of other monogastrics, like humans, but the second section is more akin to that of a ruminant species, like cattle. What is the hindgut, and what happens there? The equine hindgut consists of the cecum, large colon, small colon and rectum. It contains billions of symbiotic bacteria, protozoa and fungi, which all help to break down and absorb fiber. Like all species, horses do not possess enzymes capable of digesting fiber, so they rely on these microbes to process fiber for useful nutrient absorption. What if the hindgut malfunctions? When you consider that the majority of your horse’s diet (at least 50–60%) should be made up of forage, it makes one realize just how much work the hindgut has cut out for it. So, if something is awry, it can spell big trouble in the form of hindgut acidosis (when lower pH levels lead to increased acidity), which often leads to colonic ulcers, poor body condition, colic or laminitis. So, what’s a horse person to do? Keeping the hindgut healthy starts with keeping your horse’s overall nutrition in order. Below are some easy rules of thumb to keep in mind when feeding your equine partner(s). Feed good-quality hay. Don’t let your horse go on an empty stomach. Feed smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day or consider offering free-choice hay. Remember that less is usually more when it comes to grain. Grain is often high in sugar and starch, which is difficult for the hindgut to digest. This can have an adverse effect on pH and bacteria levels (see acidosis mentioned above). Add healthy fats in the form of vegetable, corn, flax or another type of palatable, equine-friendly oil. Remember also that movement is hugely beneficial for gut motility, so be sure to give horses ample turnout time and exercise. And, last but certainly not least, don’t undervalue the importance of fresh, clean, temperate water — hydration plays a key role in keeping the horse’s overall digestive system functioning at its best.

During this period, a calf’s immune system is not yet fully developed, which can lead to a variety of challenges, including increased costs of gain, greater chances for morbidity and higher risks for scours. Any of these individually or in combination can result in decreased profitability. Traditionally, producers have had limited options for ensuring maximum growth and health for their calves. Some strategies include supplementing calf diets with concentrates or pushing for more intensive diet rations, while others include introducing antibiotics for growth promotion. So, what will happen when the Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) hits? What is VFD and what changes will come with it? VFD is the mechanism the FDA will use to apply veterinary oversight to a broad range of products used in animal feed, such as antibiotics. In December of 2016, VFD will be implemented to promote the judicious use of antibiotics and to protect public health by limiting the development of antibiotic resistance. In short, the upcoming directive will restrict the use of antibiotics for growth promotion and feed efficiency. Once the changes are in full effect, it will be illegal to use medically important antibiotics without a veterinary prescription and antibiotics will only be available for use to prevent, control or treat a specifically identified disease. With these regulations in place, producers will be searching for new, viable alternatives to keep their operations profitable. New research supports antibiotic-free program New research from the University of Florida has been released supporting the Alltech Antibiotic-Free program. During a 52-day weaning period, Alltech’s Actigen® was fed to calves. The focus of the demonstration was to evaluate the effects of these technologies on animal health and performance. The results of the study demonstrated Actigen, a unique technology from Alltech, to be a cost-effective means of maintaining gut health and integrity to support performance. For producers focused on growth and feed efficiency, Actigen in weaning calves showed profitable returns on investment and overall decreases in cost of gain. Looking to the future, Actigen and the Alltech Antibiotic-Free program will continue to address key issues for profitability in weaning calves, including developing a healthy gut and stable rumen environment. Particularly during weaning, healthy calves will eat and produce more efficiently, ensuring they can perform at their maximum potential. The Alltech Antibiotic-Free program, including technologies like Actigen, supports producers looking for solutions to address feed efficiency and to help promote a healthy and profitable future for their operation. Alltech technologies bring together more than 35 years of research and practical application with state-of-the-art support tools and technical expertise. This gives producers a holistic approach to navigate the challenges of antibiotic-free production, and in particular, the upcoming VFD initiative.

It involves various fungal pathogens that combine to attack the plant’s main trunk and can destroy it within a few days. There is no questioning the unstoppable pace at which esca progresses. While a previous article explored the history and economic impact of esca, in this article, we will delve into what we know about its biology. Esca sensu stricto was the name given to white rot in the trunks of mature plants. The accompanying symptoms that manifest on leaves, on the other hand, are the result of extensive colonization of the trunk by pathogenic fungi, not the white rotting fungi. According to recent studies, the three primary fungal pathogens that are associated with esca include: Phaeoacremonium aleophilum, which is considered a pioneer of the esca complex system of infecting the plant through pruning wounds (but not through infected pruning tools). The inoculum is a perithecium — a hollow fruiting structure of some fungi — located in the crevices of vines that spreads after rain, most often in the summer. Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, another pioneer of esca, infects the plant in the winter after rainy events through pruning wounds. The contaminating spores come from older pruning wounds and crevices or from underneath the bark in areas previously exposed by wounds. Fomitiporia mediterranea, which is responsible for the white rot in vines affected by esca. Its spores come from the dead parts of the vine. This fungus is not present in wood that is less than one year old, meaning it cannot be transmitted from one plant to another during pruning. In every case, the wood of the vines is infected after pruning, with fungi developing and progressively colonizing the tissues of the grapevine. Slowly, the fungi impact the flow of sap in the wood, clogging its vascular system; subsequently, the parts of the vine without sap flow begin to die. The symptoms of esca only appear five to eight years after the first contamination — but when esca is present in its apoplectic form, these symptoms are so intense and spread so quickly that the vine can die in a matter of days. The most favorable conditions for esca are temperatures between 70–90° F with a humidity level of 60% or more. The especially high temperatures of summer are favorable to the apoplectic form of esca. The environmental factors favored by esca are still not well understood, however, and the different fungal pathogens associated with the disease can react differently to these parameters. When it comes to their sensitivity to esca and other wood diseases, not all grape varieties are equal. Although more than 50% of grape varieties are usually attacked by esca at rates of 5% or more, some, like pinot noir 51 or Syrah, have very low levels of esca, while Cabernet Sauvignon and Riesling are affected more often. Esca can impact quality A 2015 study run by M. Jourdes at the University of Bordeaux and the Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (INRA) investigated how esca could affect the quality of both the grapes and the wine made from the affected grapes. The study concluded that grapes affected by esca exhibited an important delay in maturity, which included less sugar (-10%) and more acidity (+20%), in addition to reduced yield. When grapes from the affected vines were incorporated, even at levels as low as 5%, the sensory properties of the wine were significantly altered, including decreased fruity aromas and an elevated earthy/vegetal/herbaceous character. Since the ban of sodium arsenite, no efficient treatment for esca has entered the market. Some recent studies have considered the effects of incorporating solutions that could activate the natural defense reactions of the plant in conjunction with molecules that exhibit antimicrobial properties. Alltech Crop Science explores organic solutions Alltech Crop Science, a global leader in innovative organic solutions, is studying alternative ways for farmers to protect their vines. The Alltech nutrigenomics research team has been studying nutritional programs that could activate the plant’s defense genes, allowing it to better defend itself against diseases like esca. Our global research partners — particularly in Spain — are also leading the charge to solve this problem, with promising initial results.

The “A” in ACE is all about the animal and innovating ways to balance highly efficient and profitable livestock production with the seemingly conflicting imperatives of environmental stewardship and consumer demand. A focus on precision nutrition Alltech’s animal health and nutrition business revolves around the science of nutrigenomics — how diet impacts genetics — and a quest for a better understanding of how to feed an animal to its specific genetic potential. An Alltech researcher reviews markers of gene expression, which provide a better understanding of how changes in the diet affect animals at the genetic level. “The more efficient that we can make these animals, the better off we are because we can get more meat, milk or eggs per pound of feed,” noted Dr. Kristen Brennan, a research project manager at the Alltech Center for Animal Nutrigenomics and Applied Animal Nutrition. “The focus of the nutrigenomics that we do is to understand how nutrition influences animals on a molecular level and how that can lead to changes that we see in production, health and well-being.” Good for the animal, producer, environment and us Intensive livestock operations produce large quantities of animal waste, which can include high levels of ammonia, nitrogen, phosphate and trace minerals. However, proper animal nutrition can minimize the levels and impacts of these pollutants. Alltech scientists are working to develop products that reduce methane emissions while improving the efficiency of the animal. “These products must reduce methane emissions from the rumen without negatively impacting rumen fermentation and negatively impacting either the milk production or growth of beef animals,” said Dr. Amanda Gehman, Alltech research project director. Finding that balance is also a focus at Alltech-owned KEENAN, the Ireland-based manufacturer of advanced diet feeders and software products. “What we’re all trying to do is to increase feed conversion efficiency (FCE) on the farm,” said Conan Condon, director of KEENAN's InTouch live review and support service. “We want to increase production while decreasing the intake of the animals. By doing that, you will increase your FCE and reduce your carbon footprint.” For Alltech Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Karl Dawson, a significant and all-encompassing ACE milestone was reached when the company introduced Optigen®, a non-protein nitrogen source for ruminants. “That had a tremendous impact in terms of what it would do for animal feeds,” said Dawson. “It not only improved animal performance, it changed the way nitrogen is utilized in cattle. It made nitrogen efficiency much greater, and you have less nitrogen in waste. “Nitrogen in waste is the precursor to one of the major greenhouse gases, nitrous oxide, which is a stronger greenhouse gas than methane,” he continued. “You can reduce greenhouses gases using that technology.” Healthy animals, healthy humans Dawson is equally focused on addressing today’s widely held consumer concerns about the use of antibiotics in livestock production as a growth promotant. Alternative solutions are being found in enzyme technologies that are becoming the backbone of Alltech nutritional programs and technologies. “We have systems that can induce the same types of changes that antimicrobials have induced using these enzymes and manipulating what’s going on in the digestion process,” he said. “As time goes on, that is going to be a real game-changer.” The potential for using low levels of these enzymes as additions to feed can be as powerful as any of today’s antimicrobials, according to Alltech researchers. “We’re producing alternatives to antibiotics in the diet that satisfy both the needs of the farmer and the production needs of the animal and also make the consumer happy because those compounds are omitted from the diet,” noted Brennan. Environment and economics — must they be at odds? Environmental sustainability has appeared to be at cross purposes with economic growth and development. Achieving high efficiency has been thought to come at the expense of the food-producing animal and the environment. “In general business, those two things can be at odds, but in cattle — and in animal agriculture, in general — efficiency really is the name of the game as far as producing less waste, less environmental pollutants per unit of milk, beef or eggs,” said Gehman. “But it’s also the same efficiency that can be applied to profitability. “In cattle, methane is an indicator of waste, not just to the animal but also to profitability, so if that animal is burning off energy as a waste product and we can make the animal more efficient so that she retains more of that energy, that can be environmentally sustainable as well as profitable for the farm,” she continued. Dr. Amanda Gehman, Alltech research project director, evaluates a total mixed ration using the Alltech® In Vitro Fermentation Model, or IFM. Improving digestibility of the diet can have a significant effect on producer profitability and environmental sustainability. Gehman is now investigating in vitro testing (using the Alltech® In Vitro Fermentation Model, or IFM) as a means of evaluating the digestibility of various forages. “We’re making that a regular test in order to fine-tune the rations, to address problems as they come and also address any opportunities to use an undervalued feed,” she said. Minerally minded While Gehman and her colleagues study ways to optimize ruminant digestion, other Alltech researchers have been focusing on how producers can feed substantially fewer organic trace minerals than inorganic trace minerals and get similar, if not better, performance. Dr. Karl Dawson, vice president and chief scientific officer at Alltech, works with ICP-MS, instrumentation used to measure the proportion of minerals in feed or food samples and their distribution in biological matrices, animal tissues or human biological fluids. Methods such as ICP-MS are routinely used by Alltech researchers as they seek to define the true mineral requirements of animals. The company’s mineral management program, Total Replacement Technology™ (TRT), has been at the forefront of a transition from inorganic trace minerals that are not efficiently digested — and even banned in some countries — to feeding reduced levels of organic minerals that animals can better utilize, reducing environmental pollution. Steve Elliott, global director of the Alltech® Mineral Management team, said the company’s scientists are also looking at the interaction of trace minerals with other components in the diet, such as enzymes, vitamins and antioxidants. “We’ve found that trace minerals can have a very negative impact on those other diet components,” said Elliott. “Research has now shown that, by using organic trace minerals, we avoid some of that conflict or interaction, thus allowing those other components to do what they’re put into the diet to do.” Ending the reliance on fish oil and fish meal Some methods of aquaculture have a very high environmental impact. A common sustainability problem in animal and aquaculture diets is the nutritional requirement of fish oil or fish meal, which is typically from wild fish. The problem with fish oil — and this really goes to sustainability and the ACE principle — is that fish oil and fish meal demand have been increasing. Fisheries around the world are at capacity, and fishing more out of them risks collapsing them. The alternative is aquaculture, but in that case, there is not enough algae in the spaces that the fish occupy. You’re feeding the fish, and at this point, the ratio of conversion is that you have to 'squeeze' one fish to get enough fish oil to feed one fish. With demand increasing, that’s not sustainable, long-term. Dr. Jorge Arias, Alltech’s global director for aquaculture, is optimistic about algae as an answer. “We believe we have a real solution in our algae that will reduce reliance on fish oil while increasing the amount of DHA available to farmed fish and, ultimately, to consumers,” he said. Sustainable seafood To further address issues of fish farming, the Alltech Coppens Aqua Centre recently opened in Valkenswaard, the Netherlands. “This is a brand-new knowledge hub for the development of innovative fish nutrition solutions to tackle both the present and future challenges facing the aquaculture industry,” said John Sweetman, Alltech's European technical manager for aquaculture. Those methods include products derived from microalgae that are fully safe, sustainable and traceable, while providing the nutritious DHA previously supplied by fish oils. ACE-ing animal health and nutrition Alltech takes a holistic approach to animal health and nutrition, mindful of what is best not only for the producer, but also the ruminant, fowl or fish that feed a growing population and the planet they all call home.

On average, Americans check their smartphones once every 12 minutes, and many report experiencing anxiety or feeling unsettled when their phones are off or out of reach. This makes sense; our phones often contain apps that help us juggle the endless activities and commotion surrounding our daily lives. And the options are seemingly endless — we have apps to tell us about the weather, to help us keep track of our fitness and finances, and even to build our grocery lists. Considering how integral this technology is to modern life, it comes as no surprise that apps are also starting to make an impact on the horse world. There are a variety of options available that cater to every equestrian, from the casual pleasure rider to the broodmare manager at a top Thoroughbred farm. No matter who they are designed for, these apps often share one common goal: to simplify horse care and provide instant access to important information. Apps for tracking your ride Whether you are a high-level competitor showing horses at the upper levels or a backyard pleasure rider out for a weekend trail ride, there are apps available to improve your ride. For instance, the Hylofit and equinITy apps help monitor fitness by tracking the heart rates of both horse and rider; they also monitor performance data to allow for the real-time assessment of performance and recovery during workouts. This rapid and continuous feedback allows riders and trainers to adjust their conditioning programs to ensure that their elite equine athletes will achieve optimal fitness. For the pleasure rider, apps like Horse Rider SOS and Ride With Me act as an extra safety measure, especially for those who ride alone or in unfamiliar areas. These apps can provide peace of mind by monitoring your movements during a ride. When the app notices a period of inactivity, which could be the result of a dangerous situation — for instance, if the rider has fallen and cannot call for help — the app will alert the rider’s predetermined emergency contacts and share the rider’s location. Apps for horse health The days of frantically trying to remember when your horse was last shod or when you are next scheduled to see the vet are over, thanks to apps like Horse Keeper and Horse Health Tracker. These apps allow you to access your horse’s health information — from their body weight to their vaccination records — in a single swipe. Both apps monitor weight and body condition, allowing you to keep notes about the diets of individual horses. They can even sync with your smartphone calendar to provide you with reminders about upcoming healthcare appointments, and they allow you to share this data with other users. And if you become aware of an issue or a problem, an app like Horse Side Vet Guide® can give you access to information and practical advice, which could be helpful to have on-hand prior to contacting your vet. Apps for barn management Along with these apps for riding and tracking horse heath, there are other apps to help equine professionals run their businesses more efficiently. The University of Minnesota’s Hay Price Calculator app provides an easy way to compare hay prices by calculating the price per ton of baled hay. The PonyApp allows barn managers to track their horses’ daily activities, manage expenses and even add reminders about their stable, while also providing industry news and information. For the active trainer working with multiple students and horses, apps like BarnManager and StableSecretary can help maintain plans for both the short term (e.g., lesson scheduling) and the long term (e.g., yearly competition goals) — and this information can also be accessed by clients. Looking for something more particular or focused than the previously mentioned apps? There are endless options, with new apps being released almost daily. For the international competitor, the FEI RuleApp provides on-the-go access to rules and regulations. For the racing enthusiast, Equibase Today’s Racing allows you to track your favorite racehorses in your very own virtual stable. For those who simply want to connect with other horse enthusiasts, there are options like The Equestrian App or Huufe: For Equestrians, which serve as social media platforms designed exclusively for equestrians. No matter what you’re looking for, you are sure to find something useful, thanks to the many apps tailored to nearly every aspect of equestrian life. I would like to receive more information related to horse care and management.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/equine-innovations-must-have-apps-equestrians","title":"\n\n                    Equine innovations: Must-have apps for equestrians\n                    ","date":"August 13, 2019","contentLength":771}},{"pageContent":"Every producer knows that when a beef cow is healthy, her calf has a much better chance of being healthy, too. Trace mineral nutrition is key for maintaining healthy cattle at all life stages. Colostrum quality, calf weight and immune function are among the many benefits from supplementing organic trace minerals in cattle. A study done in 2017 at the University of Florida and published in The Professional Animal Scientist evaluated the response of 160 Angus (AN) and Brangus (BN) cows and their calves to inorganic (ING) or organic (ORG) trace mineral sources. About the study The purpose of the study was to evaluate the difference in performance and benefits provided by feeding organic trace minerals versus inorganic trace minerals to cattle on pasture. Beef cows supplemented with organic trace minerals received cobalt, copper, manganese and zinc in the form of Bioplex® and selenium in the form of Sel-Plex®. Beef cows supplemented with inorganic trace mineral products received them as sulfates and sodium selenite, respectively. The level of mineral supplementation also varied between treatment groups: In the pelleted feed, the organic trace mineral treatment included 25% less copper, 13% less manganese and 29% less zinc compared to the inorganic trace mineral treatment. In the free-choice mineral, the organic trace mineral treatment included 45% less copper, 32% less manganese and 46% less zinc than the inorganic trace mineral treatment. The best mineral strategy for cattle is one that fits within the producer’s operation, based on their animal requirements and budget and the benefits provided from that mineral product. Organic trace minerals, such as Bioplex and Sel-Plex, are more bioavailable and, as a result, can be added at much lower inclusion rates than the traditional inorganic sources, which not only benefits the environment but, ultimately, the health, well-being, reproductive performance and growth of the animals as well. Effects of trace mineral source on colostrum The University of Florida trial revealed that colostrum from lactating cows supplemented with organic trace mineral supplement sources contained 29% more immunoglobulin M (IgM mg/dL) antibodies compared to cows supplemented with inorganic trace minerals (P= 0.07). Cows supplemented with the organic trace mineral sources Bioplex and Sel-Plex also demonstrated significantly higher levels of selenium measured in colostrum —and Angus cows specifically had twice as much selenium compared to their inorganic counterparts (P ≤ 0.001). The study results also showed that the somatic cell counts (SCC) of the colostrum from Angus cows fed organic trace minerals were 67% lower than the SCC of the colostrum from cows fed inorganic trace minerals. Additionally, Brangus cows fed organic trace minerals had 14.6% lower SCC compared to cows fed inorganic trace minerals. Effects of maternal mineral nutrition on calf weight and antibody levels As the study progressed, the researchers at the University of Florida observed that calves from cows fed the organic trace mineral sources (Bioplex and Sel-Plex) showed a statistically significant increase in their average daily gains, weaning weights and 205-day adjusted body weights compared to calves fed inorganic trace mineral sources (P ≤ 0.01). Calves from cows who were supplemented with Bioplex- and Sel-Plex- had 205-day adjusted body weights that were, on average, 22 pounds heavier compared to the weights of calves from cows that were provided with inorganic sources (P ≤ 0.01). Specifically, Angus calves supplemented with Bioplex and Sel-Plex minerals were 33 pounds heavier (205-day adjusted weaning weights) compared to calves from Angus cows supplemented with inorganic trace mineral sources. The researchers also measured immunoglobulin levels and found that the immunoglobulin A (IgA mg/dL) antibody measurements for calves from cows supplemented with organic trace minerals Bioplex and Sel-Plex demonstrated a statistically significant (40.5%) increase in calf serum 24 hours after colostrum consumption compared to calves from cows provided with inorganic trace mineral sources (P = 0.04). Bioplex® offers a range of trace minerals that provide mineral nutrition in a form as close to nature as possible. Bioplex minerals are trace minerals that are bound to amino acids and a range of peptides. They are easily absorbed and readily metabolized, optimizing animal performance. Bioplex trace minerals (including zinc, manganese, copper, iron and cobalt*) are co-factors in the enzymes that are critical for the animal’s defense system, growth and reproduction. Learn more about Bioplex here. Sel-Plex® is Alltech’s proprietary organic form of selenium yeast. It is an excellent dietary source of selenium and is manufactured to mimic the selenium found in nature. The selenium in Sel-Plex is safer and better able to meet the higher requirements of livestock raised for rapid growth, reproductive performance and health. Learn more about Sel-Plex here.

The much-loved fruit is the country’s fourth-ranked export at $1.38 billion in value, with approximately 115 million boxes of bananas sold annually to the U.S. and Europe. But among the banana trees, there is a dark battle underway. Black sigatoka and other diseases threaten to annihilate the banana industry and the very livelihood of an estimated 10 percent of Costa Rica’s workforce. Small farm plantations have been forced to cease their operations as black sigatoka has wreaked its havoc, decreasing yields by 50 percent and driving production costs up by 25 percent. Much like a real war, local residents have become used to the drone of planes flying overhead. In this case, the weapon of war is fungicide applications, which, according to Kyle McKinney, crop science development manager for Alltech in Costa Rica, took place 60–70 times in 2015 in a valiant attempt to keep black sigatoka at bay. To put this in perspective, there were approximately only five to seven fungicide applications in 2010. Enlisting nature’s help in bananas' battle against black sigatoka In 2015, Alltech constructed a lab in Costa Rica dedicated to the battle for bananas. Calling upon their expertise in microbiology, Alltech scientists “enlisted the help of friends called microbes,” said Dr. Pearse Lyons, president and founder of Alltech. This natural deployment of microbial technology appears to be having an effect on inhibiting the growth of Mycosphaerella fijiensis, otherwise known as black sigatoka. Field trials in Costa Rica have been underway, alternating weekly microbial treatments with conventional fungicides. After two years, the project has expanded to 12 growers representing over 5,000 acres and over 1.5 million boxes of bananas destined for both the foreign and domestic market. McKinney expects the program to expand its reach to other growers. “The Alltech Crop Science program has decreased chemical pesticide treatments by 20% while maintaining equivalent disease control, at similar costs, making it a viable and sustainable option for the grower,” said McKinney. McKinney noted that Alltech plans to stay the course in Costa Rica. In addition to its recently constructed lab and installation of fermentation equipment, Alltech is supporting an employee’s Ph.D. studies in Costa Rica to begin a project focused on disease control through microbial technologies.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/battling-black-death-bananas","title":"\n\n                    Battling the black death of bananas\n                    ","date":"May 12, 2016","contentLength":390}},{"pageContent":"Apple has created some of the most innovative products in the world. Steve Wozniak was the mastermind and engineer behind the Apple I and Apple II computers. Wozniak, recipient of the 2016 Alltech Humanitarian Award, addressed a packed house at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference to talk about his vision and how he sees computers in the future. “I wanted to make a machine that could do what no other machine was able to do,” said Wozniak. His main goal was to make something possible that nobody expected could happen. He accomplished this with both the Apple I and Apple II computers. Wozniak described his early days working on computer designs and trading ideas with other members of the Homebrew Computer Club in Palo Alto, California. This was before Steve Jobs was around. “I was trying to help all these other people in our club who wanted to start a revolution. We used the word revolution and everybody in life kind of wants to be part of a revolution because it always leads to better, supposedly. And I wanted to be part of it, so I gave away my design of this computer. I would show it off every two weeks at the club.” Wozniak surrounded himself with people who wanted social change. “I believed in it,” he said. When he was young, he told his parents he wanted to be either an engineer or a fifth grade teacher. He cared a lot about education and even became a volunteer elementary school teacher for eight years. Wozniak said his goal was to help kids get back in school and “stop kids from dropping out, because some kids are dropping out now around 8 years old or something crazy like that.” He started working with a girl in the fourth grade during his first year of teaching. “Her mother told me she wasn’t interested in school and learning anymore,” he said. So Wozniak took an Apple computer to her house. The Apple computer wasn’t popular at the time, so it was something new to the girl. He continued to visit her house all throughout the year. “We would spend about two hours a night just typing away, writing papers,” he said. She ended up finishing college and made the dean’s list all four years. Wozniak started Apple with Steve Jobs when they were young with no money, no savings and no business experience. He closed by recommending the three types of people that young entrepreneurs need to start a business: A guider: Someone who knows business and how to make money. A marketer: Someone who knows the quality of the product.

We’ve gone beyond fundamental safety and nutrition to a growing retail movement that seeks cage-free produced eggs and value-added product, such as omega-3 eggs. Yet we actually do not discuss enough the most basic aspect of quality that matters to everyone: eggshell strength. Simply put, cracked eggs do not sell; without eggshell quality, no other egg characteristic matters. Similar to prenatal vitamins for a pregnant woman, the quality of an egg can be greatly impacted by the nutrition of the layer hen. By changing a bird’s diet, everything from chick development to shell condition can be affected. For this post, we are going to focus on the effect minerals can have on shell strength, specifically in regard to the form those minerals are given in. On the farm, up to 90% of total losses can come as a result of poor eggshell quality. Shell strength is important to eggs for withstanding the sometimes turbulent shipping process or to protect developing chicks from external world. A strong shell is the difference in making sure eggs make it safely from the farm to your plate, or your child’s paint brush in the case of Easter painting traditions. Even though eggshells are composed of 94 percent calcium carbonate and 1.4 percent magnesium carbonate, many new studies are now revealing the critical role of trace minerals in eggshell formation. A 2012 study from the Institute of Biodiversity, Glasgow, United Kingdom, found that strength is reduced by the inclusion of abnormal forms of minerals in the diet. Conversely, in bioplexed form, selenium, manganese, zinc, copper, and iron are absorbed more readily. These elements are essential nutrients to shell strength and are crucial to a number of enzymatic processes that lead to optimal shell formation.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/hard-crack-secret-strong-eggshell","title":"\n\n                    Hard to Crack: The secret of a strong eggshell\n                    ","date":"March 24, 2016","contentLength":313}},{"pageContent":"John Calipari and Alan Mulally are two key leaders in today’s world who focus on team-centered leadership. At ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference, Calipari, head men’s basketball coach at the University of Kentucky (UK), and Mulally, former CEO of Ford and the recipient of the Alltech 2016 Medal of Excellence, both spoke on the idea of building a team and working together to achieve goals within a team. Although their experiences come from different sectors, they share many of the same ideas. Calipari gave five main points that he thought best suit his style of being a leader and building a team, while Mulally explained what he did to bring Ford out of a $12.7 billion loss. Calipari: Connection, communication and creating community leaders Calipari talked a lot about his “one and done” athletes, who come to UK for one year to play basketball and then leave straight for the NBA. He explained that it all starts out with “staying in the moment.” “You can’t get it done in one day,” said Calipari. He challenges all his teams at UK to abide by this rule. He also encourages his teams to stay steady and keep everything in perspective. “You have to try stuff and fail fast,” said Calipari. He emphasized building relationships based on trust that will last forever. Social media is “vital in today’s world,” he said, and you have to “connect with a lot of people, reform, act quickly.” But he noted that social media can’t take the place of face-to-face contact and creating an attitude through caring. It shows his players that he is serious about his job and he wants what is best for them. These are all the steps Calipari said make someone a “servant leader,” and this is important because Calipari feels it is his job to build community philanthropists in his team members. All of his former players who are now in the NBA are involved in their community in some fashion, and Calipari feels that this in particular is a personal affirmation that he has done his job well. Mulally: Making working together work Mulally, like Calipari recruiting for his team, recruited the best people to work at Ford. He made sure that he surrounded himself with 16 leaders, nearly all of whom were already Ford employees. He hired the best 16 for the job and made sure that they all supported each other and their teams in the workplace. Coming in at a time when Ford faced a $12.6 billion loss was a challenge, but Mulally felt company unity could bring them through it. “The team decided that they were going to work together and share the issue, and people were going to survive,” said Mulally. That’s what was needed to overcome such a big deficit. With everyone buying in and trusting not only Mulally but their entire Ford team, it made everything run more smoothly and lifted them out of that loss. “Everybody has to know what the plan is; everybody has to know what the status is,” said Mulally. He shared four key points for leading a team: Go after a compelling vision Include everyone Work on strategy Check it out – review the plan and make sure it’s working (i.e., goals are being achieved) “Working together always works,” he said.

Since Alltech’s 2015 North America Harvest Analysis, additional testing through the Alltech 37+® mycotoxin analysis is now indicating type A trichothecene mycotoxins are on the rise. According to Dr. Max Hawkins, Alltech Mycotoxin Management team nutritionist, type A trichothecenes, composed of T-2, HT-2, diacetoxyscirpenol and neosolaniol, have shown an increase in levels present from 33.18 parts per billion (ppb) in September to 86.38 ppb in February (as illustrated by the trend line in Figure 1). Type A trichothecenes are now present in 46 percent of all samples of corn silage. “The levels are higher than in years past, and exactly why that may be is difficult to identify. There may be many causes,” said Hawkins. Type A trichothecenes are produced by Fusarium molds. Fusarium molds require moisture levels at or above 70 percent humidity as well as oxygen and a temperature range that can include cool days and nights to cool nights and hot days. Corn plants stressed from insect damage or birds, plant disease, wind and hail are always a concern for mold proliferation. Corn silages that are drier, poorly packed and allow greater oxygen penetration are also at a greater risk. The Alltech 37+ mycotoxin analysis tested 239 corn silage samples from Sept. 1, 2015, to March 8, 2016. The average sample contained 5.28 mycotoxins. The Risk Equivalent Quantity, or the risk represented by all of the mycotoxins present, is at higher risk in 59.1 percent of all corn silage samples with another 17.7 percent at a moderate risk. “Over 75 percent of corn silage presents an increased risk to dairy cows,” said Hawkins. “This contributes to the complexity of the mycotoxin mixture that is included into total mixed rations (TMRs) and can lead to increased mycotoxin impact on cow health and performance.” Type B trichothecenes and fusaric acid were present in more than 90 percent of the samples, while fumonisins have been found in over 70 percent of the samples. The levels of these mycotoxin groups have remained relatively constant at a moderate-to-high risk since harvest. Type A trichothecene toxins, however, have shown a steady increase since January. In the dairy cow, type A trichothecenes first affect the rumen where they are partially metabolized. Rumen adsorption may be increased by rumen acidosis. When cellulolytic bacteria activity decreases, protein synthesis is reduced. The ingestion of type A trichothecenes can cause reduced feed intake, slower weight gain, decreased milk production, digestive disorders (vomiting and diarrhea), acute hemorrhagic enteritis, reproductive failure, increased mortality, hemorrhages (stomach, heart, intestine, lung, bladder, kidney), edema, dermatitis, immune suppression, abomasal and ruminal ulcers and death. Serum immunoglobulins and complement proteins are lowered in calves receiving T-2 toxin. Also, a reduction in white blood cell and neutrophil counts in calves can be observed after exposure to these types of toxins. “The increasing level of type A trichothecenes, along with the steadily higher level of type B trichothecenes and fusaric acid, creates a combination of mycotoxins that can easily increase the risk of corn silage that is being included into the TMR,” Hawkins said. JPW Nutrition recently utilized Alltech’s 37+ mycotoxin analysis program to test corn silage and TMR samples for some of their customers in the Midwest. The results indicated type B trichothecene toxins were most prevalent; however, type A trichothecene mycotoxins were also showing up. Jason Prins, a nutritionist with JPW Nutrition, wasn’t surprised the analysis found type A trichothecenes, as he had observed issues with stomach linings being excreted and gut health challenges on the dairies. “From a reproduction, immune response and gut health standpoint, we need to know what type of mycotoxins are having an impact. Finding out which types of mycotoxins are present in the feed allows us to make adjustments in the diet accordingly,” said Prins. “For our clients, we have found that it is better to be proactive than reactive with these issues.” Figure 1 - Type A Trichothecenes Risk in Corn Silage","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/2015-corn-silage-test-again","title":"\n\n                    2015 Corn Silage – Test Again\n                    ","date":"March 26, 2018","contentLength":698}},{"pageContent":"Fumonisin is commonly found in corn at levels of 2 parts per million (ppm) or less, but in recent years, testing has confirmed levels well above 30 ppm, and some even above 100 ppm. Livestock producers should be aware of the fumonisin contamination when purchasing grain because, when consumed by animals, fumonisin toxicity affects several of their biological systems, leading to reduced feed intake and efficiency and liver damage. Understanding the effects of these mycotoxins in cattle feed is key to maintaining animal health and productivity. Mycotoxins in contaminated feeds have differing effects on animals. Mycotoxins are secondary metabolites of molds and fungi that infect plants. More than 500 mycotoxins have been identified, and most animal feedstuffs are likely to be contaminated with multiple mycotoxins. The effects of mycotoxins vary, as each mycotoxin has its own specific impact on the animals consuming the contaminated feeds. The Fusarium species are the predominant types of mold that contaminate crops and, eventually, animal feed. Ranging from white to pink or red in color, these molds are associated with wet conditions and moderate temperatures, especially following insect or hail damage. They are found worldwide, largely in corn. Fusarium molds produce several mycotoxins, including fumonisin, deoxynivalenol (vomitoxin) and zearalenone, with higher concentrations in the stalks and cobs than in the grain. Signs of fumonisin in cattle While cattle are generally resistant to many of the negative effects of mycotoxins, thanks to the degradation of the compounds by rumen microbes, high levels of mycotoxins in feeds can significantly impact animals. Fumonisin, in addition to not being significantly degraded in the rumen, is also not well-absorbed. The majority of fumonisins consumed by cattle are passed out in the feces. However, fumonisins can overwhelm the gut and cause significant issues in cattle. The presence of fumonisin in the feed reduces palatability and, as a result, slows intake. Cattle may stand off a bunk contaminated with high levels of fumonisin. Calves without fully developed rumens and animals that are dealing with stressful situations, such as weaning or transportation, have an increased sensitivity to fumonisin due to reduced rumen fermentation and weakened immune functions. Fumonisin can negatively impact animal health: Even low levels of fumonisin affect gut health. The gastrointestinal tract is impaired when cattle consume mycotoxins. Gut epithelial cells need protection from direct interaction with microbes and the gut environment. Specialized cells in the epithelium provide this protection. One example of these specialized cells is goblet cells, which produce mucus, coating the epithelial cells to lubricate and protect them from the contents of the gut. Intestinal cells also have specialized structures to form tight junctions, limiting the passage of molecules between cells. These mechanisms and others work in concert to prevent pathogen colonization and systemic access by toxins and pathogens. Although fumonisin is poorly absorbed and metabolized by cattle, it induces disturbances in the gastrointestinal tract. Rumen motility can slow down, resulting in the increased exposure of the intestinal epithelium to the effects of fumonisin and other mycotoxins. Even low amounts of mycotoxins in cattle feed can impair intestinal health and immune function, resulting in altered host-pathogen interactions and an increased susceptibility to disease. The epithelial cells in the gastrointestinal tract are damaged by fumonisins, reducing the mucin layer thickness, tight junction strength and cell proliferation and, ultimately, increasing the opportunity for pathogen invasion. Fumonisin has toxic effects on the liver and kidneys. An analysis of tissues from cattle fed Fusarium in high doses indicated that the majority of fumonisin absorbed is retained in the liver, with lesser amounts retained in the muscles and kidneys. This accumulation is concerning, as fumonisin is toxic to the liver and kidneys and causes apoptosis, followed by the proliferation of regenerative cells in the affected tissues. Fumonisin also reduces the antioxidant levels in the liver, decreasing the animal’s defense mechanisms. This leads to liver lesions and elevated enzymes that are indicative of liver damage. Fumonisins interrupt sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism. The disruption of sphingolipid metabolism is the mechanism underlying much of fumonisin’s negative impact in the body. Sphingolipids are specific types of fats that protect cells from environmental damage by forming a stable, chemically resistant layer on the cell membrane. Fumonisins disrupt cell signaling by inhibiting ceramide synthase, interrupting sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism, and can alter the morphology of affected cells. This reduces cellular stability and protection, leading to cell death and significant alterations to cellular metabolism and cell-to-cell communication. Mycotoxins can increase susceptibility to diseases. Calves that consume fumonisin experience decreased immune function, due in part to the impairment of lymphocyte development. Sphingolipid metabolism in immune cells is involved in the signaling pathways that control lymphocyte development, differentiation, activation and proliferation. Lymphocytes are the white blood cells that are important for maintaining a strong antigen response. These lymphocyte-related problems mean that consuming Fusarium molds can increase an animal’s susceptibility to diseases and reduce vaccine efficacy. Handling contaminated feed in your beef cattle operation Unfortunately, once mycotoxins are formed in the plant, there is no commercial method of removing them from contaminated feeds. Harvesting and storing contaminated crops at low moisture levels (i.e., less than 15%), along with the separation of highly contaminated feeds, is important in order to reduce the risk of mold growth and mycotoxin production in uncontaminated grain. While the European Commission recommends that adult cattle can tolerate fumonisin levels of up to 50 ppm in diets, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s guidance for fumonisins recommends a maximum concentration of 30 ppm in the diet of feedlot cattle, 15 ppm for breeding stock and 10 ppm for calves. Furthermore, contaminated corn or corn byproducts should contribute no more than 50% of the diet. It is crucial to check the level of fumonisin in the complete diet, as it can be three times more concentrated in corn byproducts, such as distillers grains and corn gluten feed, and 10 times more concentrated in corn screenings. If contaminated feeds must be used to feed cattle, elevators may blend the corn to reduce the fumonisin concentration to acceptable levels, or producers can include feed additives to mitigate the risk of mycotoxins. As fumonisin is associated with reduced feed consumption, there is a concern that low levels of fumonisin can interact with other mycotoxins, reducing the growth of calves and slowing the weight gain of feedlot cattle. Fumonisin contamination can be especially detrimental to newly received cattle and calves, preventing them from getting off to a healthy start. Testing services like Alltech® 37+ and Alltech® RAPIREAD® can help producers and feed mills assess their mycotoxin risk so that the appropriate management and nutritional measures can be put in place.

Type 2 Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects the way the body metabolizes glucose, resulting in insulin resistance. Insulin resistance (IR) is a syndrome that affects other mammalian species, including dogs, cats and horses. When a healthy animal eats, food is broken down, sugars are absorbed in the intestine and blood glucose levels increase. As a result, a hormone called insulin is produced by the pancreas, which tells muscle, liver and fat to increase the uptake of glucose so it can be stored for future use. When an animal or human becomes insulin resistant, this doesn’t happen. As a result, the body keeps producing insulin, hoping that it will help and glucose will be stored, but instead both blood insulin and glucose levels stay high. While exact causes are unknown, often the onset of IR is preceded by weight gain and obesity. High sugar or starch diets can cause lower insulin sensitivity even in non-obese animals. In some cases, it’s believed that high starch diets can make animals more prone to IR because they did not evolve to eat those diets such as cats who are true carnivores. In the case of horses, overfeeding can trigger weight gain and increased adiposity, which can lead to IR. While it may not seem like a big deal at first, elevated blood insulin and glucose levels can cause long term health problems. For instance, the hyperinsulinemia (elevated blood insulin levels) in horses can induce laminitis, which causes inflammation in the hoof wall lining and lameness. In companion animals and people, unmanaged insulin resistance can cause kidney damage and loss of vision. Treatment of IR is often through diet and health management, which sounds simple but can be a challenge to those affected. Management includes having the discipline to monitor carbohydrate consumption and exercise on a regular basis. However, human error such as underestimating intake or overestimating exercise intensity can lead to poor disease management and chronic problems. One area that shows promise for improving insulin resistance is the inclusion of microalgae meal in the diet. Microalgae meal is a heterotrophic strain of algae containing high levels of the omega-3 fatty acid, Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), produced by the global animal nutrition leader, Alltech Inc. In a trial conducted at the Alltech Research Farm, insulin resistant horses were fed a diet supplemented with microalgae meal and their blood insulin and glucose responses were measured. Researchers found that both insulin and blood glucose levels were reduced compared to horses that did not get microalgae. This means that microalgae, or a component of the microalgae like DHA, caused the horses’ bodies to become more insulin sensitive without changing their diet (beyond microalgae meal inclusion) or increasing exercise. For people who struggle to manage IR in their pets, this is great news. While diet and exercise management is still essential, this research shows another way people can improve the health and well-being of their animals that have become insulin resistant and prevent the devastating conditions that can result from not properly controlling insulin and glucose levels in IR animals. To help fight IR, microalgae meal must be added to your pet’s diet on a daily basis. If this simple addition to your pet’s daily diet can help prevent IR and all of its devastating complications like blindness, lameness or kidney failure, why wouldn’t you feed it?","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/people-pets-addressing-problem-insulin-resistance/diabetes-algae","title":"\n\n                    From People to Pets: Addressing the Problem of Insulin Resistance/Diabetes with Algae\n                    ","date":"March 29, 2018","contentLength":602}},{"pageContent":"Mission-driven companies are often viewed as places where employees feel their work contributes to a higher purpose. When it comes to “mission-driven agriculture,” the industry is now responding to consumers who are looking for their food/diet to serve a higher purpose, said Rebecca Noble, Alltech Crop Science business development executive. “Consumers’ perceptions of their diet have changed,” added Noble. “Food and nutrition are now seen as a gateway to health. It’s not just about weight loss and body image.” A 2015 Nielsen report asserts that, globally, 80 percent of consumers are choosing foods for their diet as a means to forestall health issues and medical conditions. Consumers are also increasingly factoring agricultural production methods into their food purchasing decisions. “Their decisions are now based on beliefs and convictions that go far beyond cost and convenience,” said Noble. “Awareness about the social and environmental impacts of farming is also fueling their decisions.” Agriculture is being called upon to reinvent itself and further propel human advancement. “The industry is now being transformed into a mission-driven industry,” she said. Who is in the driver seat? Perhaps in no other industry are the needs and desires of consumers being felt so profoundly than in food production, commented Noble. “Mission-driven consumers are flooding the marketplace with greater capacity and purchasing power each year,” she said. Believing that the right food choices will lead to better health, 25 percent of consumers are willing to pay a premium for products, with the following five categories being key: All natural GMO-free Low/no fat Gluten-free Organic The organic category continues to be the largest segment for attracting premiums in store aisles. In 2014, organic sales in the U.S. reached $40 billion, and global sales are projected to reach $1 trillion by next year. Grocery stores are reporting that new food perceptions are especially concentrated in younger generations, with millennials driving the organic category. Adding to the momentum is Generation Z, aged 20 and under, as many of them head to college and make independent food purchases for the first time. With growing demand, retailers are working creatively to keep their organic supplies steady. One big box store is even lending money to farmers to help them secure land for organic production. What’s ahead on the journey? Sales of foods grown locally could eclipse sales of organic food. Grocery chains and big box retailers are aggressively expanding and marketing their locally grown offerings for sale. Retailers are finding themselves reinventing their stores to provide high quality, locally produced food that is also affordable. Demands on conventional farming are the next frontier, as consumers continue to want to know more about the way in which their food is produced, explained Noble. “Mission-driven producers are working carefully to not just change their agricultural practices to respond to consumer demands,” she said. “They are helping to tell the story — creating new narratives — surrounding food production.” Likewise, some large retailers are creating consumer-facing campaigns. They are educating shoppers beyond health and wellness issues to producers’ management and land practices, water use, farm worker safety and energy consumption. Within a mission-driven agriculture system, Noble described symbiotic relationships forming between both retailers and consumers and retailers and producers. “Consumers are no longer just simply eating,” said Noble. “Retailers are no longer simply just buying and selling. Producers are no longer being asked to just simply produce. Things have been put into overdrive.” Metaphorically, we’re all in the car together, concluded Noble. This will call for true collaboration, especially between retailers and producers, to realistically and systematically take us to the next frontier. “Consumers and retailers are influencing each other, and more and more producers are taking their business, their mission and how they are perceived in the market into their own hands,” Noble concluded. Finally, market competition will play a key role in keeping mission-driven dreams balanced, attainable and accessible for all. Rebecca Noble was a presenter at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference.

Yet, while wheat is a staple for Kentucky farmers, profitability remains challenging. Alltech Crop Science has conducted trials on 82 crops in 34 countries, but they also believe in working with local universities to provide cutting-edge technology for the state’s grain crops. The challenges faced with wheat in particular represented an opportunity for research to deliver practical solutions. Therefore, Chelsea Jacobson, Alltech Crop Science research coordinator, recently conducted a nearly yearlong trial in partnership with the University of Kentucky to study the effect of amino acids on soft red winter wheat production. The research focused on the foliar application of nitrogen (25–75 percent protein) in the form of amino acids at two key stages: Late tillering (Feekes Growth Scale 3–4) Early boot (Feekes 7–9) The timing of the first application was important for several reasons, said Jacobson. “Tillering begins in fall and will not be complete until early spring,” she said. “Head size is determined during this stage, as well as the number of spikelets per spike.” Both of these play a key role in grain yield. It’s important for producers to take measures to improve yield before Feekes 5, Jacobson noted, as the wheat plants emerge from the cold period of weather. The second application, at early boot stage, is just as critical. “It’s important to protect the flag leaf from disease and other stressors during this time,” added Jacobson. “This supports grain fill and is crucial to high yield.” The study showed a numerical increase in grain yield and test weight for the treated wheat compared to the control, reported Jacobson. One amino acid treatment showed a yield advantage of 4 bushels per acre. Another benefit was a numerical decrease in grain moisture at maturity. “This can help farmers get into their fields quicker and get their crops harvested,” noted Jacobson. Organic nitrogen delivered to the plant in the form of amino acids provides a source of organic carbon to encourage soil microbial populations. “Plants must synthesize their own amino acids,” reported Jacobson. “This technology can ultimately reduce the plant’s workload and allow for an optimized uptake of plant nutrients.” Alltech’s unique fermentation technology provided a nutrient-dense application. Products in the company’s nutrition portfolio have a consistent profile of 18–20 amino acids. “Through proper nutrition, plants can reach their maximum genetic potential,” said Jacobson. While yield and return on investment are key to today’s commodity prices, natural nutrition can in many cases also help farmers reduce the need for synthetic inputs. “It’s all about keeping plants healthy and taking a more natural, bioavailable approach,” concluded Jacobson. “Farmers are looking for alternatives to synthetic chemistry. This new research shows the benefits of amino acid technology.” Have a question or comment?","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/wheat-research-shows-benefits-amino-acid-technology","title":"\n\n                    Wheat research shows the benefits of amino acid technology\n                    ","date":"March 29, 2018","contentLength":492}},{"pageContent":"Like anything new or different, antibiotic-free production comes with its own challenges. And, these challenges make up many of the reasons why a lot of farmers currently don’t produce animals fully antibiotic-free. On top of this, today’s producer has the difficult proposition of producing more with less to meet the demands of a growing global population. How then can they reach that goal without the enhanced production available through antibiotic use? Typical antibiotic-free livestock production challenges Although they may vary by the environment, management methods and location, below are just some of the risks pig and poultry producers have to prepare for in antibiotic-free production systems: Pig challenges Poor gut integrity, leading to increased vulnerability to feed contaminants. Increased variability and days to market. Reduced water intake. Reduced feed consumption. Susceptibility to stress. Increased risk of exposure to bacteria/pathogens. Increased treatment costs. Increased post-weaning diarrhea. Increased post-weaning mortality. Poultry challenges Day-old chick health. Bacterial load in the gastrointestinal tract and the litter. 7-10 day-old mortality. Uniformity. Coccidiosis control. Therapeutic interventions. Feed passage and weight gain. Ultimately, all these potential issues can add up to extra costs for the producer. To avoid this, it is important to focus on a couple key areas: biosecurity and nutrition. Biosecurity in antibiotic-free production Effective biosecurity can not only help producers manage disease challenges, but also prevent the increased risks of many of the issues listed above. Required measures may include changes to animal flow, increased focus on housing and transportation cleanliness, as well as heightened securities on those entering the facilities, whether that be a worker from another farm or a small rodent visitor; it is important protect the animals from the risk of exposure. Nutrition in antibiotic-free production To be truly effective, it can’t be a silver bullet approach. With antibiotics reduced or removed, the front line of defense may be nutrition, but that is just the start. A combination of strategies has to be put into effect. By powering nutrition with technologies designed to support the animals’ immune and digestive systems, and by implementing a full program focused on maintaining proper health, producers give their operations the best chance for a sustainable and profitable future. Some producers have been ahead of the trend, and have been practicing antibiotic-free production for many years. “When we accepted the challenge to go antibiotic-free from birth to market a few years ago, it proved to be a real challenge,” said Everett Forkner of Forkner Family Farms in Richards, Missouri. “But with the addition of nutritional innovations, we have not only been able to meet the challenge, we are producing more efficiently than when we began.” Each farm is different, requiring each nutritional program to be tailored to meet the needs of the animals and their environment for a truly effective antibiotic-free approach. When asked what some of the keys were to making the transition, Forkner said, “Establishing the right nutritional platform takes time. You have to allow some time for adjustments in order to really see what is best for the animals. And for us as a livestock breeder, it has also been about selecting superior animals and genetic lines that have more natural health and stronger immune systems. On top of this, a major component for us has been building this into a comprehensive immunization program while enhancing our management procedures. This combination has been what has helped us go multiple years and generations of genetic selection with no antibiotic support.” Due to the Veterinary Feed Directive, we will see more and more U.S. producers focusing on antibiotic-free production. And with nearly 50 countries having some form of antibiotic restrictions, it is a global trend that will continue to grow.

This description sounds like a dream job to me, and six months ago I would not think it a reality, yet I live it every day. In the course of four short months, I have not only had the opportunity to travel, to learn and to grow, but I also have had the opportunity to work for a vibrant and dynamic company full of some truly amazing people. It hasn’t been easy, just as no new adventure should be. Living in a foreign country, so far and so different from my home country, can be quite challenging at times. I have, however, been able to build a very supportive team around me, from the mini-CDP group to the extended dairy CDP team to the Alltech Malaysia team, and even to the team on-farm here in Malaysia. I can access people who offer advice, support, encouragement and a kind ear. I am a cold weather-loving Canadian who has been placed on a dairy farm in tropical Malaysia. I have the opportunity to work in all areas of the farm, learning more about dairy farming and the challenges it faces due to the environment in Malaysia. This is a dynamic job, and I have been able to participate in a wide variety of tasks, such as bottle feeding newborns, diagnosing and treating sick calves, inventorying feedstuffs, being involved in diet reformulation, breeding cows, pulling calves and milking cows. I have been able to do it all! This isn’t just about working on the farm. I have learned how to manage people, how to better communicate across language barriers, and train and teach both staff and student interns. My understanding of dairy cattle and the dairy industry on global, Canadian and Malaysian levels has expanded greatly. I could not do all of this without the great family that is Alltech. The training I have been provided with is top-notch, and the people have made the greatest difference. They are open and welcoming,supportive and encouraging.

Currently a 2016 Alltech Career Development Program member, selected as one of 11 from more than 2,000 global applicants, Mack is fluent in Mandarin Chinese and has traveled the world, spending at least a month each in Taiwan, China, Indonesia and Peru. Growing up, the Louisville, Kentucky-native and her family were active in scouting, which led to a love for all things outdoors and a particular passion for environmental and sustainability issues. She received her Girl Scout Gold Award for rehabilitating a pond at a state park in Kentucky. “When I started to learn Chinese, I tied my background in environmental issues into it,” she said. This led to Mack’s first application for a Fulbright research grant. She was named a semifinalist at the time. After a second attempt for a Fulbright grant to India for an English Teaching Assistantship, Mack discovered that her third attempt, this time for Malaysia, would prove to be a charm. Recently, she was named one of 90 Fulbright grant recipients for Malaysia, where she will live and work as an English teaching assistant next year. “My application centered around and was interested in looking at the environmental issues faced by countries and markets that want to evolve and become more economically developed,” said Mack. “They are facing a lot of pressure from other countries that want them to evolve in a sustainable manner. In Malaysia specifically, rainforest preservation and palm oil are really hot topics.” Where exactly Mack will be located in Malaysia is yet to be determined and will depend on the needs in the school system. In addition to teaching English, Mack will serve as an ambassador of the U.S. “They want you to do things like run afterschool clubs, whether badminton or helping set up English clubs,” said Mack. She is also looking forward to integrating her environmental and sustainability interests into conversations and learning more from her Malaysian neighbors. “My perspective is someone coming from the U.S. and is totally different from someone who is actually living there and understands how it is going to affect them and change certain things.” Following her time in Malaysia, Mack plans to return to Alltech with a desire for more adventure and opportunity. “I just see this as a natural continuation of what I’ve been doing for so long,” said Mack. Considering the list of Fulbright alumni, it is quite a promising path for her. Mack joins an elite group; Fulbright recipients have gone on to win Pulitzer Prizes (82 recipients) and Nobel Prizes (54 recipients), take on roles as heads of state (33), and become members of the U.S. Congress (10) and the U.N.

Yet, any horse owner will tell you that there are few things that incite more worry. That’s because an equine tummy ache can spell real trouble if not attended to both swiftly and correctly. Like humans, dogs, pigs and many other species, horses are monogastrics. They only have one simple, single-chambered stomach. However, rather unlike several of their monogastric counterparts, horses are non-emetic, meaning they lack the ability to vomit. Their digestive systems are designed as a one-way street, so when they overeat, have excess gas or consume something harmful, they have no way to rid themselves of the discomfort other than through defecation or, in extreme cases, surgical intervention. This interesting EQUUS article from equine veterinarian Dr. Joe Bertone explores potential anatomical reasons and other speculations as to why horses lack the ability to eject ingested toxins. Equine colic concerns are heightened in the dreary winter months due to changes in available forage, decreased water consumption and reduced exercise. But, of course, colic can strike any horse, at any time of the year. Prevention is truly the best course of action when it comes to this all-too-common equine ailment. So, what can you do to prevent colic in your barn? 1. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate Though horses are typically more comfortable in colder temperatures, they are very sensitive to the temperature of their drinking water. If it’s too cold, they won’t drink much. To ensure adequate consumption of at least 10–12 gallons for a mature 1,000-pound horse, 45–65 degrees Fahrenheit is ideal. If necessary, use a trough heater or de-icer to maintain optimal drinking water temperatures. 2. Take it outside It’s commonly known that horses kept in stalls are more likely to colic than horses kept on pasture. The ability to freely walk around and continuously graze keeps the gut moving, which helps to keep colic at bay. This doesn’t mean you have to keep your horse turned out at all hours, but make sure to provide plenty of turnout time for your four-legged friend. 3. Feed the need Remember that horses are large herbivores meant to continuously consume ample quantities of grass and/or hay. With pasture grass dying and becoming less readily available in the colder months, hay can take over as the total forage portion of the horse’s diet. These drier meals can often equate to less moisture in the horse’s gut. Plus, the wait between meals can seriously slow down digestion. Rather than throwing the usual few flakes a couple of times a day, consider investing in a slow feeder that will give your horse round-the-clock access to quality grass hay. 4. Let that pony run Only if it’s properly warmed up, in shape and on good footing, of course. Just like humans, horses should not stop exercising in the wintertime. Physical movement helps to maintain gut motility. Some days, it really is too cold to safely ride your horse and, in that case, hand-walking should help to keep the gut — and both you and your horse — sufficiently active. 5. Keep an eye on “number two” You read that right. And, no, I’m not referring to the second point on this list, though it’s also a great tip. Monitor your horse’s manure to gather an idea of how frequently they pass it as well as the volume and consistency of their stool. Small, hard droppings or a reduced number can be a warning sign of the dreaded five-letter word referenced throughout this article. Follow these simple guidelines to help you and your horse(s) stay on track for happy, healthy and hopefully warmer days ahead.

What do you say about someone who, when we brought him to Ireland, packed the hall? He was a man who said the least but also the most. When we brought Muhammad Ali to Ennis, Co. Clare, Ireland, to Turnpike Road, where his great-grandfather, Abe Grady, came from, to say the streets were packed would be an understatement. With ties from all over the world right there in the middle of Ennis, we laid a stone commemorating the return of a long lost brother to Ireland. I will never forget seeing him when I was a 26-year-old, fight Blue Lewis from Detroit, right there in my home of Dublin at Croke Park. The pounding these men gave each other was remarkable, and you would have to be there to hear it to understand. When I said to him many years later, as I saluted him at our annual Symposium event in 2009, \"You know when you were in your prime, and I was in my prime, I always reckoned that I could take you in three.\" He looked at me, looked at the audience, and signaled on his head with his finger that I was loopy. At the 2010 Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games, Ali was most at home when he was greeting the children from Haiti. They sat on his knee, and he tickled their tummies, and they knew they were safe with him. I sat with him in the car waiting to go into the Kentucky Horse Park outdoor arena for the Opening Ceremonies of the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games, and Coach Calipari had gone in the stadium just before us.

He waved to the left and to the right to all his adoring fans. That is the Muhammad Ali I will always remember. I have a collage of pictures in my office of our memories together, and not a day goes by that I don't see it. To have had the opportunity to meet him when we brought him across to Ireland to visit his great-grandfather’s home, and to watch his face as we relived his fights on the plane’s movie screens on the trip over is something that I will never forget.

With its “Jobs and Water” theme, United Nations’ (U.N.) World Water Day 2016 aims to address water sanitation and workers’ rights issues to forge solutions that benefit both individual workers and the global economy. In the coming decades, the agriculture industry, the world’s largest employer and consumer of water, will play vital roles both in feeding a projected global population of 9 billion in 2050 and developing ways to reduce groundwater and runoff water contamination connected to food production. Between now and 2050, the World Bank projects that required food production will increase 60 percent and water withdrawal will increase 15 percent. Today, clean drinking water remains unavailable for almost 700 million people worldwide for various reasons, from lead in the pipes in Flint, Mich., to extreme desert conditions in Sub-Saharan Africa. By 2025, the U.N. predicts 1.8 billion people will live in areas of high water stress, potentially leading to the displacement of millions. Lack of clean water, in addition to raising risks of famine, disease and refugee crises, also causes serious detriment to a nation’s GDP, the World Bank noted in a 2015 report that labeled water security as the number one global threat in terms of development impact. Almost half the world’s current workforce—an estimated 1.5 billion people—participate in water-related industries. Many laborers, like the Sub-Saharan African women who walk miles to deliver their families clean water, are unpaid and are unable to develop other work skills because no clear alternative exists. Basic labor rights also remain elusive for large numbers of water-related workers, as suggested by the 340,000 workplace deaths annually attributable to water sanitation issues, according to the U.N. Yet, amid these dark clouds, there is also cause for optimism, according to Guy Ryder, International Labor Organization (ILO) director-general and chair of UN-Water. ILO coordinated this year’s World Water Day on the U.N.’s behalf. “Water can contribute to a greener economy and to sustainable development, but for this to happen we need more workers qualified to realize the potential of new, green technologies,” said Ryder in his official World Water Day video message last week. “The fact is that water is work.” Across the world, the water Ryder referred to is agriculture-related. Agriculture accounts for 80 percent of all water consumed in the United States and as much as 90 percent in some Western states, reports the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Globally, 70 percent of withdrawals are for agriculture, an industry that employs 1.3 billion people, according to French agriculture think tank Momagri. Water scarcity, given its impact on agriculture, can threaten even the world’s strongest economies. Case in point: India. India’s agriculture industry employs almost half of its 1.3 billion residents and accounts for 18 percent of its $2 trillion GDP. However, a third straight lackluster monsoon season due to the weather pattern El Nino, coupled with significantly below-average reservoir levels, could lead to low crop yields, increased food prices and an economic downturn, according to a recent Bloomberg Business article. “Water security is India’s biggest challenge,” Shashi Shekhar, secretary of India’s Ministry of Water Resources, told Bloomberg. “What has happened in India is a warning and a lesson for the world,” Seth M. Siegel, author of New York Times bestseller “Let There Be Water,” said during a recent edition of his podcast of the same name, highlighting the juxtaposition between the country’s abundant amounts of water and enormous water problems. Siegel chronicled Israel’s rise as water innovators in his best-selling book and will share solutions to the world’s water crises during ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference, to be held in Lexington, Ky. from May 22-25. As Siegel alluded, India is not alone. Even in South America, home to 28 percent of the world’s freshwater, according to the Global Water Partnership, rising global temperatures are creating water-related issues. The continent’s largest city, Sao Paolo, Brazil, faced a critical water shortage last year due to its worst drought in 80 years, resulting in government officials imposing water rations. Extreme drought in the American West also led California, the most populous state in the U.S., to implement water rationing in 2015 for its 38 million residents. Managing rising water demand and costs depends upon efficient irrigation systems and improved on-farm water management, according to the USDA’s study on water and irrigation use. Conserved water rights programs, water banks, water markets and regulated irrigation withdrawals* are examples of institutional measures that could improve watershed-scale water-management, reduce the impact of irrigated production on offshore water quality and conserve water for nonagricultural demands, the USDA noted. However, the type, size and location of irrigated farms, along with legal and institutional measures governing water use, will determine such conservation programs’ effectiveness. Animal diets can also have a significant effect on water usage and groundwater contamination. Alltech creates products that maximize overall efficiency by lowering agricultural production time required and the amount of animal feed excreted back into the environment. The latter results in less water used in production and less water contamination respectively. Alltech’s Bioplex® range of organic trace minerals meets the higher nutrient demands of modern livestock for rapid growth, maximum reproductive performance and optimal animal health. Alltech’s Allzyme SSF® works in synergy with the animal’s digestive system to break down layers of the feed that were previously inaccessible through digestion. Alltech takes very seriously the challenges of improving nitrogen and mineral utilization to protect groundwater and surface water, said Dr. Kate Jacques, the company’s director of nutrition. As the world’s greater user of water and top employer, agriculture has an unparalleled opportunity to impact the sustainability of the world’s new “oil.” Glossary: Conserved water rights programs and water banks: State water management programs that either “bank” conserved agricultural water for future use, or share, lease or even sell conserved water (ers.usda.gov; oregon.gov).

Those in the industry find this information useful; it’s an indicator of growth and progress and serves as a good resource for policy-makers, financiers and industry groups and associations. But why should the rest of us be interested in this data? What can the feed industry tell us about food trends, consumer demands and people’s tastes? As it turns out, quite a bit! Alltech’s 2020 Global Feed Survey not only established the trends in feed production — it also gathered information through a qualitative survey to home in on these hot topics and see what their effect might be on animal agriculture and the feed industry as a whole. This year, the feed survey was presented by Dr. Mark Lyons, president and CEO of Alltech, who moderated a panel discussion featuring industry experts in food and agriculture, including: Jack Bobo, CEO, Futurity Bianca Martins, general manager, Alltech Mexico Matthew Smith, vice president, Alltech U.K. Brian Lawless, North American species manager, Alltech More than 1,200 people tuned in to watch these specialists dissect the data and analyze how feed production numbers reflect global trends. How does animal feed production echo consumer trends? The feed industry is at the very beginning of the food chain. The amount of compound feed (the grains fed to animals) grown in each country indicates what people there consume. The hype around current food trends might indicate that people are losing interest in animal protein, citing concerns over climate change or animal agriculture production practices. Whether consumers are truly seeking animal protein alternatives or not, however, is revealed by determining the number of animals being consumed and, therefore, how much feed is grown to produce those animals. The feed survey actually indicated that the global consumption of meat is on the rise.* “Consumers are making more and more demands on [agriculture], one of them being alternative proteins,” Lyons said. “However, the impact may not be as strong as we once believed.” Not everyone is eating soybeans and seaweed As the results of Alltech’s annual animal feed survey revealed, if people are seeking alternative sources of protein, it’s not to the extent that the media hype might indicate. If anything, feed production for chicken, beef, milk and eggs is increasing, which means that people are still consuming those foods — and at a higher rate. Demand is on the rise, and countries that are developing and increasing in wealth are seeking more animal-based foods, including meat, milk and eggs. In countries where there is already a strong demand for meat and animal products, the idea that the population is making a major shift continues to circulate — but so far, that isn’t actually the case. There are challenges associated with plant-based diets, such as ensuring that the body gets all the essential amino acids it needs. Some grains and legumes can serve as supplements, but they do not have the same level of bioavailability as meat. Consuming meat, milk and eggs is one way to guarantee that the body gets complete proteins. Despite claiming interest in alternative diets, nutrition is still a concern for many. As Martins explained, “Income is increasing in emerging markets, but people still aren’t eating well. It’s not enough to (just) feed people; the nutritional value must be there.” Many meat substitutes also contain an array of mixed ingredients in order to appeal to the senses the way meat does: through taste, smell, texture, sight and sound. These additives, however, don’t appeal to the clean-label requests of many shoppers, who much prefer the one-ingredient label of traditional meats. Additionally, consider high-protein diets, such as keto and paleo, many of which rely heavily on animal protein for sustenance. According to the 2020 Alltech Global Feed Survey, the need for animal protein as a food source is growing and will continue to grow, particularly in the poultry sector. In reference to African swine fever (ASF), which has decimated the pig populations of Asia-Pacific and Europe, Smith said, “The events of the past 18 months are moving us closer to the crossover point, where the world will consume more poultry (than pork).” Eating plants won’t save the planet Consumers often cite environmental concerns as one of the main reasons they prefer a plant-based diet. Unfortunately, two-thirds of agricultural land, also known as marginal land, is unusable for crop production; it is either too dry or the soil quality is poor. This land is, however, perfect for ruminant livestock animals, who can digest roughage and convert it into something humans are able to digest: meat and milk. Conventional agriculture has gotten a bad reputation for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, but what is often overlooked is the opportunity agriculture has to help alleviate not only its own emissions but, potentially, emissions from other industries as well. That’s right — farmers could effectively have a positive impact on GHG emissions. (If you want to learn more about this, check out our blogs on methane digesters and silvopasture, a natural approach to raising cattle in forested pastureland.) If all 7.5 billion people on this planet decided to only consume plants, it would be very difficult to farm enough crops to provide everyone with a nutritionally balanced diet. Animals provide a way to turn the nutrients from our earth into something our bodies can use very effectively. Technology to the rescue! Advanced technology in agriculture (known as ag-tech) is also improving efficiencies in production by allowing farmers to use real-time data to maximize production, improve animal welfare, reduce waste and more. Precision agriculture allows farmers — including growers and producers of feed ingredients, such as corn and soybeans — to produce more with less. We are currently producing 60% more milk with less than half as many cows as we once did, and this evolution has taken place over the span of just one generation. In the last 70 years, we have significantly improved feed efficiencies by gaining a better understanding of how the animal operates biologically, what type of nutrients it needs and how those nutrients are best absorbed by the body. The Alltech Global Feed Survey shows us that the animal agriculture industry is strong and growing. Improved agricultural practices and technological advancements put agriculture and food production in a positive light. It’s not all doom and gloom — but “the messaging to consumers is very important,” as Lawless said. There is clearly a disconnect between the potential of agriculture and the understanding of consumers, who are increasingly less knowledgeable about where their food comes from or how it is produced. “Consumers have never cared more, or known less, about where their food comes from,” said Bobo. Consumers are certainly keen to learn more about food production, and it is up to agriculture to tell the story. *There was a decrease in overall feed production in 2019, but this was largely a result of African swine fever, a viral disease that is decimating the pig population, particularly in Asia-Pacific and Europe. All other indications for animal feed production show increases in production. References Butler, D.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory condition that can spread from person to person. The virus that causes COVID-19 is a new coronavirus that was first identified in the city of Wuhan, China. How is COVID-19 spread? It is likely that the virus that causes COVID-19 emerged from an animal source but is now spreading from person to person. It is believed that the virus spreads mainly among people who are in close contact with each other (within 6 feet) through respiratory droplets that are disseminated when an infected person coughs or sneezes. It may also be possible for a person to contract COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that is hosting the virus and then touching their mouth, nose or possibly their eyes, although this is not believed to be the main way the virus spreads. Learn what is known about the spread of coronavirus here. What are the symptoms of COVID-19? Patients with COVID-19 experience mild to severe respiratory issues with the following symptoms: Fever Cough Shortness of breath What are the serious complications caused by this virus? Some patients contract pneumonia in both lungs and experience multiple organ failure, and some patients have died. What can I do to help protect myself and my coworkers at my dairy? People can protect themselves from respiratory diseases by taking the following preventive measures every day: Avoid close contact with sick people, both on and outside of your dairy. Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth if your hands have not been washed. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use a hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Wash your hands before you eat after working in the milking parlor or other areas of the dairy. Ask the dairy manager or owner to keep the restrooms stocked with disinfectants and soap. Always wear milking gloves. Constantly change milking gloves. When you get home after working in the dairy, always take a shower and wash your work clothes. Keep the bathrooms and kitchen area in your workplace clean and disinfected. Keep tractors clean and disinfected. Keep social distance. If you are sick, to prevent transmitting your respiratory illness to others, do the following: Stay home if you’re sick. Cover your nose and mouth with a disposable handkerchief when coughing or sneezing, then throw it away. Frequently clean and disinfect the objects and surfaces you touch. Form emergency plans for your dairy in the event of an illness. Ask the dairy manager or owner to call the doctor’s office if you have severe symptoms. Is there a vaccine for COVID-19? There is currently no vaccine to protect against COVID-19. The best way to prevent infections is to take daily preventive measures, such as avoiding close contact with sick people and washing your hands frequently. Is there a treatment? There is no specific antiviral treatment for COVID-19. People with COVID-19 can seek medical attention to help relieve symptoms.

A combination of quality nutrition, veterinary guidance, and increased consideration of barn and bird management will help to ensure birds have the best possible chance to perform at their maximum potential. The acronym “FLAWS” has commonly served as a reminder to check feed, light, litter, air, water, (bio)security, sanitation, space and staff. FLAWS actually serves as a detailed approach to best management practices, not only during brooding but throughout the life of the flock. Some critical focus areas are as follows: 1. Biosecurity Well-defined biosecurity practices throughout broiler production (pre-, during and post-placement) are crucial to successful poultry production. Effective biosecurity can aid hygiene, vermin and insect control on-farm and help to limit disease transmission within and between barns. 2. Downtime between flocks Adequate downtime of at least 14 days with appropriate cleaning and disinfection measures between flock placements helps to reduce transmission of disease between flocks and allows time to prepare for the next flock. 3. Pre-placement preparation Pre-placement preparation is needed before the new flock arrives to help prevent losses during brooding and the rest of grow out. Checkpoints to keep in mind: heaters, floor temperature, temperature and relative humidity probes, ventilation, drinkers, feeders, etc. 4. Coccidiosis prevention Coccidiosis is a disease caused by a microscopic intestinal parasite. This parasite can have an impact on intestinal integrity and may predispose birds to other intestinal problems. Maintaining intestinal integrity during this time through innovative technologies provided in the Alltech® Gut Health Management program is critical in allowing birds to perform to their maximum levels despite gut health challenges. 5. Brooding management With today’s improved genetic capabilities and the fast growth of birds, more time is being spent during the critical brooding phase. As a result, ensuring a good start in poultry production can have a significant impact on the future health and performance of the birds. The brooding period is an important time for intestinal growth and the development of a balanced microflora. 6. Litter management The litter in a poultry house acts as bedding for the birds. In addition to standing and resting on the bedding, birds will naturally peck at the litter. Litter condition and quality have an impact on broiler intestinal health and profitability, starting from when the chicks are placed all the way through production. Wet litter presents a vicious cycle for intestinal health. Without proper management, even in patches, wet litter can serve as a breeding ground for potential pathogens and may be a starting point for intestinal stress that develops and leads to disease. As wet litter problems increase, ammonia levels in the barn rise, which can be potentially detrimental to bird health. It is much easier to prevent and manage litter moisture conditions before they start. Some factors to consider which may help prevent the development of wet litter: type of material, quality of litter, litter depth, water quality, drinker line management, lighting management, ventilation and temperature. Litter that is too dry and dusty can be one of many indications that the birds may not be drinking enough. Too much dusty material may lead to respiratory problems. 7. Water management Drinking water accounts for 70–80 percent of the bird’s daily drinking needs. Poultry will generally consume more water than feed. As a result, water is the most critical nutrient for poultry. An abundance of clean water will reduce challenges and maximize performance. Factors to consider when thinking about water management include: Quality, height, pressure, mineral content and accessibility Cleanliness of drinker lines/regulators prior to flock placement and during production Flushing water lines between flocks and during production Elimination of biofilms and mineral buildup Drinker equipment maintenance 8. Feed management Birds must have easy access to feed. Proper feeder line height corresponding to the height of the birds helps to reduce feed wastage and mixing feed with litter, and it ensures that all birds have access to feed. Adequate feed access is also achieved by following the feed line manufacturer’s recommendations for the number of birds per feed pan or line of trough feeder. Birds will naturally peck at litter but avoiding “out-of-feed” events helps to reduce the potential for birds to peck excessively at the litter. Simple measures like activating trigger feed pans and monitoring feed bin levels during barn checks can help to prevent such events. Good feed quality that avoids contaminants like mycotoxins is important to ensure performance. 9. Stocking density A higher stocking density of poultry in addition to crowded housing conditions has been shown to have a negative impact on performance, causing stress to both the birds and intestinal microbiota. Lowering stocking density throughout the overall production of the birds may help to reduce challenges. 10. Environmental management General environmental management of the barn includes many components, such as temperature, relative humidity, ventilation and lighting. Understanding that these components work both separately and together can help to guide your management practices. 11. Monitoring during times of transition Increasing the frequency at which barns are walked and examining the activity of the flock can help with early disease detection. Daily monitoring of temperature, humidity and ventilation inside the barn as well as outside temperature is recommended. Monitoring transition times can help with understanding what is happening in the barn (e.g., from day to night, when birds are placed, during half-house brooding, feed changes, etc.). Monitoring feed and water consumption helps to monitor the flocks’ progress. 12. Keeping an eye on equipment Walking the barns routinely will also help to ensure equipment remains in working order. 13. Mortality checks Cull diseased birds as early as possible. 14. Flock health management Work with your veterinarian to design a program customized for your flock’s health. 15. Communication and teamwork Ensuring strong communication and coordination between all those involved in helping your farm run smoothly will ensure a stronger and more successful gut health management program for your birds.

All healthy soils have three essential components: optimal nutrient availability; good biodiversity; and a balanced structure, with higher levels of organic content. Plentiful and available nutrients Healthy soils have a plentiful supply of minerals and other essential nutrients, as well as a balanced pH, making them readily available for uptake by the plant and offsetting mineral depletion by returning minerals to the soil though fertilization and decomposition. Factors like temperature and pH can greatly vary and reduce nutrient availability. In highly acidic soils, for example, phosphorus and calcium availability is poor, while nutrients like iron and copper are less available in soils with high alkaline levels. Maintaining biodiversity and building a strong biome High-performing soils have a vibrant population of insects, worms and microbes. A strong microbiome is a miniature environment that harbors little to no pathogens and, instead, is rich in beneficial organisms that promote root and plant growth. Certain crop practices — such as heavy tilling, depending on soil needs — can have a harmful effect on soil biodiversity, resulting in the loss of these organisms and their myriad benefits and potentially allowing pathogens to get a foothold. Balanced soil profile Balanced, silty soils with high organic content combine good aeration with excellent nutrient and water retention, requiring fewer costly inputs. Sandy soils may be well-aerated but can find it more difficult to retain water or nutrients. Clay soils, on the other hand, may be able to store more water and nutrients but are poorly aerated. Generally, a low organic content means that the soil is, overall, less fertile. Healthy soils are beneficial to growers and lead to more efficiently grown crops. During the growing season, plants are susceptible to disease pressure and encounter various environmental stressors, such as heat, frost and drought — all of which could reduce plant potential and yield. Healthy soils, however, can minimize the effects of these stresses and mitigate potential stress-induced losses. These well-balanced soils are rich in organic matter and can provide much of the nutrition the plant needs, limiting inputs and their associated costs while increasing sustainability and profitability for the grower. Healthy soils are more environmentally sustainable, and they also represent a valuable revenue-generating asset — not only for current growers, but also for their successors.

More recently, they’ve come to expect the same immediacy and transparency when it comes to knowing where their food comes from, who produced it and where, as well as what went into production. What’s in my food and is it good for me? In recent years, many consumers have become generally uncertain about the safety and quality of their food, and their risk perception differs largely from that of those within the agriculture and food industries. Consumers sometimes display misguided and inconsistent behavior with respect to food safety and risk information. But, with widespread coverage of foodborne illness outbreaks from national chain restaurants and an abundance of seemingly credible misinformation, it’s easy to empathize with consumers and their lacking confidence in food safety and quality. The more consumers feel they know about food production practices, the greater the level of trust consumers have in the food production practices. In a survey conducted by Sullivan Higdon & Sink Advertising and Marketing Agency, 69% of consumers reported that that they think it’s important to know how their food was produced.1 67% want more information on the meat packaging. 60% want to know if the animal was given growth hormones. 42% want to know what medicine the animal was given during its lifetime. 34% want to know what the animal’s living conditions were like. 34% want to know where the animal was raised.1 Unfortunately, less than two-thirds (63%) of global consumers trust the information they receive on food packaging.2 Consumers view food with a skeptical eye. In the food production industry, product quality, safety, nutritional value and consumer trust are vitally important to the success of the producer. In the wake of this consumer doubt lies an opportunity for producers to be more transparent about the contents and source of the food they put on the market. What are the solutions for rebuilding consumer confidence in food safety? As industry professionals, it’s our responsibility to help consumers establish food system connections and help bridge the gap between lay and expert opinions regarding food risks, including traceability. Food producers should be the leading voice for food, giving consumers the information they crave, straight from a credible source—the person who’s growing the food to bring to their table. Actively show commitment to quality, safety and traceability. It is vitally important to show your consumers that you are committed to providing them food free from bacteria that causes foodborne illness and free from contaminants like mycotoxins, heavy metals, dioxins and PCBs. Be proactive with your on-farm practices to create a healthier animal and more nutritious crops, and in turn, a healthier consumer product. In food production, quality is as much about safety as it is about nutritional value. Bottom line: Most consumers view food quality, safety and traceability as interlinked concepts.

However, this longevity comes at a price, as it only increases the chances for your canine companion to develop a common form of arthritis known as degenerative joint disease (DJD) or osteoarthritis. What is DJD and why do dogs get it? Again, much like we humans, our pets’ joint tissues often begin to deteriorate with age. This process is commonly gradual and affects the smooth layer of cartilage known as articular cartilage that is found at the ends of bones in one or more joints. Articular cartilage plays a key role in reducing friction within joints and allowing them to move smoothly. The breakdown of this protective cushion often leads to pain, inflammation and a decreased range of motion. While any joint can be affected, DJD often compromises a dog’s lower back and limbs. Of course, some dogs are at an increased risk for developing this ailment, including large or giant breeds, due to their general size and weight placing more mechanical stress on their joints, as well as those who compete in high-impact sports, such as agility, dock diving or flyball. Poor nutrition, conformation and genetics are other potential factors. DJD can also develop as the result of a bone or joint injury or in connection to the stress of extra weight on joints in overweight or obese dogs. This is just one more reason why it is vitally important to keep your dog at a healthy body weight at all stages of life. What are some signs of canine osteoarthritis? A lasting vestige of their wild origins, dogs often instinctively hide their pain until it becomes severe, as showing signs of weakness would have made their ancestors vulnerable to potential predation. An obviously lame dog may be in potentially serious pain, which could be a sign that the DJD has reached an advanced stage. It is, therefore, especially important to monitor aging canines and those with a possible predisposition for subtle early warning signs, such as: Stiffness — often noticeable as your dog moves from a lying to standing position Lethargy — you may suddenly realize that your dog is sleeping a lot more than usual Irritability, especially in response to being touched in certain areas Inability or reluctance to jump into the car or onto furniture Hesitance or refusal to take stairs Decreased interest in activities such as walks or playtime If you suspect that your dog might be suffering from arthritic pain, schedule an exam with your vet in order to obtain a definitive diagnosis and to formulate a plan for treatment. What are the treatment and management recommendations? Unfortunately, DJD is a progressive condition with no known cure. Treatment goals should include providing pain relief, fostering an improved quality of life and being as proactive as possible in delaying any further progression of this ailment. If you have a dog with arthritis, your vet may prescribe or recommend anti-inflammatory drugs, pain-relieving medications and/or joint supplements, which often contain glucosamine, methylsulfonylmethane (MSM), hyaluronic acid (HA) or chondroitin sulfate. For more advanced cases of this disease, an injectable, disease-modifying osteoarthritis drug (such as Adequan®) that has been designed to inhibit cartilage loss in a dog’s joints may be recommended. Alternative therapies — including acupuncture, laser therapy, aqua therapy, chiropractic adjustment and massage for dogs with arthritis — are also an option and may be used in conjunction with medication. In more severe cases, surgery to remove damaged joint tissue or to replace the joint entirely may be required. Weight control is by far the most critical aspect of managing DJD. At an ideal body weight, you should be able to feel your dog’s ribs easily but not see them, and you should be able to see a visible waist when looking at your dog from above and a tucked-up belly when viewing your dog from the side. If you suspect that your dog needs to lose some weight, consult with your veterinarian about putting together a diet plan. You may also find it best to modify your dog’s activity levels, perhaps retiring from high-impact events like agility or flyball and replacing them with more controlled activities, such as regular on-leash walks. It is important to keep your dog moving, even if it’s at a slower pace than what you both might be used to, as consistent low-impact exercise serves to maintain the tone of muscles that promote joint stability and helps to combat overall stiffness. You may want to place an orthopedic dog bed or two around the house (away from cold or damp areas) to help alleviate joint pressure as your pet rests. You may also provide carpeted steps or a ramp to help your pet get up onto or down from higher resting spots, such as the bed or couch. Many owners might also wish to place additional non-skid runner rugs throughout the home to help their arthritic dogs navigate slippery footing more easily. Fortunately, dogs often live comfortably for years following a DJD diagnosis, so long as proactive steps are taken to manage this condition.

Yet, all of these products tend to be generically labeled as “organic trace minerals,” and the lack of consistent definition has created confusion in the animal feed industry. In the recent webinar “Form Matters: Three reasons your mineral program might not be up to par,” Dr. Richard Murphy, research director at the Alltech European Bioscience Centre in Dunboyne, Ireland, examined the differences between the types of trace minerals that are available in terms of structure and how these minerals are likely to interact with other premix and feed components. Key takeaways from the webinar include: 1. Not all organic minerals are the same; what the mineral is bound to will determine its form. 2. The key defining characteristic of an organic trace mineral is the ability to maximize its pH-dependent stability and optimize delivery to the intestine. 3.

By Colm Duffy – Alltech On Farm Sales Support Producing the highest possible quantity of milk from forage must become the priority for dairy farmers. Producing the highest quality forage available not only produces a feed that is ideal for ruminants, as they are fibre digesters, but has the potential to significantly reduce your winter feed costs. Looking ahead to the winter, it is important to get a sample taken from your silage pit and have it analysed to see what exact supplementary feed is needed. The main components of silage to look out for are DMD (dry matter digestibility), dry matter, protein, ME (metabolisable energy) and pH. DMD expresses in percentage terms, the digestible organic matter in the silage and is a measure, like ME, of the usable energy in the silage. Feeding 140kg of fresh silage that is 2.5 percent higher in DMD will allow a farmer to feed 1kg less of meal per cow per day. Crude protein concentration directly reflects the quality of the grass at harvest with young, leafy grass giving high protein silage while older steamy grass produces low protein silage. The higher the protein in the grass silage, the less supplementary protein that needs to be provided. ME is a measure of the usable energy in the silage. Young leafy grass can have a ME concentration greater 12 MJ/kg DM and this can drop to below 9 MJ/kg DM at the hay stage. The dry matter concentration is the quantity of material remaining after all water has been removed from the silage. The trend in recent years has been towards higher dry matter silages through wilting and this can have a positive effect on the amount that animals will eat, however when silages are too dry they are more difficult to consolidate causing openness at the silage face resulting in mould growth and heating. The pH is a measure of the acidity of the silage; it gives an indication of the fermentation quality and hence the ability of the silage to store. If the pH is too low there may be problems with reduced intake and the silage may need a buffer, however this is unusual in well preserved silages with dry matter greater than 20 percent. A high pH value indicates a poor fermentation in low dry matter silages but it is quite common to have a high pH in well preserved silages with higher dry matter concentrations.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/what-should-i-look-when-testing-silage","title":"\n\n                    What Should I Look For When Testing Silage?\n                    ","date":"August 20, 2014","contentLength":423}},{"pageContent":"The buzz of the beehive is growing silent. A mysterious grim reaper has been killing off large percentages of the insect population responsible for the majority of the food we consume. Colony Collapse Disorder is the term scientists have coined for the little-understood cause of an approximately 30 percent annual reduction in the number of bees on our planet. The trigger of such “beecide” may be multifactoral, possibly involving pathogens, parasites, pesticides and environment stressors such as climate change and habitat loss. The potential impact of this perplexing problem could sting much more than the bees’ own memorable pokes. Seventy-five percent of all cultivated crops are unable to produce without pollination! Morehead State University in Kentucky is already beginning to feel that sting. The university is home to Browning Orchard, a 250-acre farm that produces 23 varieties of apples. The apples are processed by several local cider mills, are used by the University of Kentucky for hard cider research and also serve as the centerpiece of the university’s much-loved Apple Festival held each autumn. “We use bees to pollinate our trees. For the past three years, we have lost some of the bees — not all of them, but some of them,” said Amy Poston Lentz, then-horticulture supervisor in the Department of Agricultural Sciences at Morehead State University and team advisor to the 2016 Alltech Innovation Competition undergraduate winners. Each time they experienced bee losses, a new hive needed to be started, driving up their production costs at the orchard. So they decided to craft a plan B. The Pollinizer: A drone alternative to real bees An undergraduate team of Morehead students, representing a collaboration between the school’s agriculture and business programs, designed “The Pollinizer,” a drone attachment capable of mimicking the pollination activities of a real bee. Not only does The Pollinizer present an alternative should worst fears be realized and more of the bee population is decimated, but the team noted that their drone attachment can increase and improve yield by working in conjunction with the bees. After winning first place in the undergraduate category of the 2016 Alltech Innovation Competition in Kentucky, the student team — Jordan Bach, Tessa Combs, Adam Lyon and Dalton Shepherd — is still considering their next steps but plan to pursue a patent. The team is being advised by Janet Ratliff, assistant professor of management/entrepreneurship, director of the Center for Economic Education and advisor for the student organization Students in Free Enterprise at Morehead State University. Most importantly to them, they say, is the impact this project could have on their school’s orchard as well as the surrounding community. Morehead State University is located in eastern Kentucky, a region that has been hit hard economically by the decline of coal. Lentz noted that reclaimed mountain tops in the area are now becoming apple orchards and small farms.

The lucky travelers are winners of the 11th annual IFAJ-Alltech Young Leaders Award, which recognizes 10 exceptional communicators from across the globe. This year’s group will represent North America, Belgium, Ghana, Australia, Austria, Norway, Burkina Faso, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. According to the participants, the international diversity and interaction is a major attraction. They are eager to strengthen their reporting skills, but they also hope to learn about the agriculture industry in the boot camp’s host country of Germany and trade information with other attendees on agricultural issues from their home countries. “My expectations are to learn a lot from other outstanding agricultural journalists, network with my international peers at the event and enjoy learning more about German and European agriculture on the tours,” said Sarah Hill, a freelance journalist from South Dakota. Hill is specifically hoping to learn more about what the dairy and beef industries are like in Germany and Europe. She also said she hopes to hone her skills as a writer, photographer and marketer. Julienne Isaacs, a freelance writer based out of Canada, feels like the conference will offer a lot of new ideas for her and the other journalists in attendance. “I have been told by other journalists that they make the IFAJ Congress a priority every year, no matter where in the world it is held,” she said. “I am expecting the conference will offer an abundance of new ideas and opportunities to connect with colleagues from around the globe.” Isaacs is also looking forward to deepening her skills as an agricultural journalist, but mostly she is hoping to develop friendships with professionals working in very different contexts than her own and to learn from their experiences. Inoussa Maiga, a multimedia communicator from Burkina Faso, shares the same views as Hill and Isaacs in the sense that she expects to learn new ideas from different sectors of the world. “This is, for me, a unique opportunity to learn from others’ experiences, the state of agricultural journalism and communication in their countries,” said Maiga. A lot of the participants are already friends through social media, so they are looking forward to meeting each other in person. Jennifer Latzke, a previous boot camp participant and winner of the IFAJ-Alltech Young Leaders Award in 2013, explained that she and the other participants started a Facebook group about a month before meeting so that they could all introduce themselves. “When we finally got together in person, it was like seeing old friends,” she said. For Latzke, the coolest part was meeting people from around the world, talking about agriculture in their own regions and realizing that they really have more in common than they have differences. “Agriculture is such a global industry today that it's so powerful to have connections around the world to talk to about global events that affect not just U.S. farmers, but their foreign counterparts, too,” she said. Latzke also shared that they may just be together for 10 days or so, but they will make lifelong friends. Her final advice to the 2016 participants: “Be prepared to not only learn from your instructors, but from each other as well. It's the sharing of lessons from your countries, those personal experiences and connections, that will prove more lasting than you can imagine. We may not all have the same skills sets, but we all have the common purpose of communication and education of our readers and listeners. You'd be amazed at what you'll pick up from your counterpart halfway around the world!”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/packing-ag-journalism-boot-camp","title":"\n\n                    Packing up for ag journalism boot camp\n                    ","date":"June 29, 2016","contentLength":633}},{"pageContent":"The KEENAN “Green Machine” has made its way from Ireland to Northern India, with Gurpreet Singh Grewal being the first KEENAN machine owner in the area. Gurpreet has worked in the dairy business for the past eight years and is currently milking 105 Holstein dairy cows on his farm. Gurpreet is the owner of HG Grewal Dairy farm in Chimna village, Jagroan Tehsil, in the state of Punjab — an area with a continuously growing dairy sector. Jagroan Tehsil is one of the leading milk belts of Punjab and is home to most of the Progressive Dairy Farmers Association’s active farmers in the state. Milk is the main product from livestock in Punjab, accounting for nearly 80 percent of the total value of livestock output. Punjab is considered one of the most progressive states for the dairy industry in India. Dairy farmers in this area are adopting the latest techniques and technology rapidly, and Gurpreet is among those early adopters. He bought a KEENAN ECO50 in December 2017 after attending an Alltech event, completing research and receiving recommendations from his brother.

One of the best ways to give your puppy the right start to a long and happy life with you is by feeding it healthy, nutritious food. But with so many options (there are literally thousands of choices on the market), you may be feeling overwhelmed or simply unsure of the best selection for your pet. Or, if you own multiple dogs, you may be wondering if the answer is as simple as feeding them all the same food (it’s not). The great news is that through extensive scientific-based research and modern technology, we have achieved greater comprehension of the specific needs of growing dogs. We understand now more than ever that properly balanced nutrition is essential to the appropriate development of both mind and body. Unfortunately, there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to nutrition since needs may vary depending on specific breeds, traits and life stages, but there are some general guidelines that can be followed to get you and your pup on the right path to spending many years together. Nutrition for healthy, happy puppies 1. Puppy nutrition versus adult dog nutrition: Puppies mature rapidly and have twice the daily nutritional requirements of adult dogs. Their muscles, joints, bones, internal organs and immune system are just a few of the major components that are developing in their first one to two years of life. Therefore, they require a high-fat/high-energy, 30 percent protein diet with increased levels of many essential vitamins, minerals and amino acids. A complete and balanced puppy food will contain specific nutrients tailored to meet these critical needs. Your puppy should be fed three times per day until it reaches 6 months of age. You can then reduce meals to twice daily. You can read more about the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) recommendations for growing puppies here. a. Large breed puppies have unique needs: Owners of large breed puppies should take additional heed when selecting food because orthopedic diseases can arise if appropriate nutrition is not applied. Large breed dogs that grow too fast can suffer from hip dysplasia, knee problems or other comparable concerns. It is imperative that a large breed puppy formula is fed, which should contain a lower fat content and reduced caloric density than food intended for small to medium breed dogs. 2. High-quality puppy food: Choose food based on high-quality ingredients, backed by proven research, that meets or exceeds AAFCO and National Research Council guidelines. Your veterinarian, breeder or trainer may also be able to guide you in the right direction. 3. Moist, semi-moist or dry food and how much to feed: Dry food is generally considered to be the best option because it contains more meat protein, is more efficient, is easily digested and is better at keeping teeth clean. Regarding how much to feed, it is generally recommended to follow the label guidelines based on your dog’s age. Do not overfeed. 4. How long to feed puppy food: Generally, dogs are considered puppies until they reach their anticipated adult size. Most dogs are about a year old and at 80 percent of their expected size when the transition is made from puppy to adult food. Speak with your veterinarian if you are unsure of when to make the change. 5. Switching food: Luckily, dogs are generally not considered very picky eaters. Transitioning from an old food to a new food should be a fairly straightforward experience but should be done gradually to avoid digestive upset. Mix small amounts of the new food in with the old food, gradually increasing the new and decreasing the old over the course of at least seven days. Last, but certainly not least, it is critical to avoid overfeeding your pet. Like the human obesity crisis, pet obesity in the U.S. has reached epidemic levels. The Association for Pet Obesity Prevention estimates that 54 percent of dogs in the United States are overweight or obese. This is entirely in your control as a responsible owner. Even a few extra pounds can lead to chronic health issues and a shortened lifespan. Follow recommended guidelines for feeding, even for treats, and provide ample exercise to keep your pet (and possibly you, too) at a healthy weight level.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/new-year-new-puppy","title":"\n\n                    New year, new puppy?\n                    ","date":"March 1, 2018","contentLength":729}},{"pageContent":"Though historians may disagree on the exact timeline of the first U.S. Thanksgiving — and it is unknown whether turkey was even on the menu back then — the annual tradition of consuming this uniquely American bird on the fourth Thursday in November eventually caught on, and Thanksgiving was officially declared a national holiday by President Abraham Lincoln in 1863. The official \"pardoning\" of White House turkeys, however, didn’t get its start until much later. The National Thanksgiving Turkey Presentation began in 1947 under President Harry S. Truman and carried on over the next few decades, with presidents occasionally sparing the birds from their dinner table fate to live out their remaining days on farms or in zoos instead. It wasn’t until 1989 when, during his first year in office, President George H. W. Bush decided to instill a permanent Thanksgiving poultry pardon, thus resulting in the tradition that has carried on annually for 29 years. How it works Each year, shortly before Thanksgiving Day, the National Turkey Federation (NTF) organizes the presentation of a live bird to the current U.S. president. The NTF chairman receives a formal White House invitation and arrives with two turkeys in tow, and though one bird is official and the other is considered a back-up, both go on to a life of leisure after their presidential pass. To fulfill the annual pardon, a small flock of Broad Breasted White turkeys is raised each year, typically on the farm of the current NTF chairperson. The birds are rigorously maintained and are even trained to handle the pressures of fame — loud noises, flash photography and crowds — and to stand quietly on a table. Finalists are ultimately chosen for both their looks and their personalities. Their names are then selected by White House staff, who often receive suggestions from schoolchildren residing in the state in which the birds were raised. For instance, the 2017 pair raised in Minnesota were aptly named Drumstick and Wishbone. While these birds are typically short-lived — the average lifespan of this meaty breed is between three and five years — the pardoned turkeys often go on to spend their golden years at posh digs like George Washington’s Mount Vernon estate. They’ve also previously received new homes at Disney World, Disneyland, a Virginia farm park and a special home for turkeys at Virginia Tech University known as Gobbler’s Rest. A first-time honor For the first time ever, South Dakota will have the honor of providing the 2018 White House turkeys. Manager of Riverside Turkey Farm Ruben Waldner, this year’s presidential turkey handler, has raised a special flock of 49 birds and will aid in selecting the lucky duo. During the week of Thanksgiving, the birds will be escorted by Ruben to their special suite overlooking the White House at the four-star Willard InterContinental Hotel, where they will be introduced to the media before being presented to President Trump by Jeff Sveen, chairman of the board of Dakota Provisions and current chairman of the NTF. As former President Barack Obama mentioned during his final turkey pardon in 2016 — when he kept turkeys Tater and Tot from becoming a Thanksgiving meal — one thing’s for sure: these birds will get to ride the gravy train to freedom.

We grabbed Randy Asher, Alltech’s regional sales manager, with a host of consulting experience on mycotoxin issues for beef and dairy operations, for a little Q and A. What’s made the conditions for mycotoxins particularly unique this year? The weather was a huge factor this summer. Regionally, weather conditions varied a lot, with Kansas having heavy rainfall and a large crop, whereas other areas, like West Texas and New Mexico, were historically dry and production was down. The overall amount of stress was pretty high, too, because of the weather. Even the regions that got rain had long dry periods in the middle of the growing season and then lots of rain right before harvest, especially in the Corn Belt. This created an inconsistent environment, with both wet and dry patches in the crop, which, unfortunately, is perfect for mold and mycotoxin growth. Producers should really be on the lookout this year, just as Dr. Max Hawkins described in his Animal AgWired interview. What have you heard about the 2016 crop so far? What does it mean for feeding cattle? DON will be the story this year. DON, also known as vomitoxin or deoxynivalenol, is one of an array of trichothecene mycotoxins produced by Fusarium graminearum and looks to be at much higher levels than normal. Aflatoxin levels also look to be high in this year’s crop. What DON and aflatoxins are known to do is inhibit the synthesis of protein in cattle and alter the immune system. As a result, feed conversion, particularly in lightweight feedlot cattle, is really affected and overall performance goes down. To combat this, everyone needs to be diligent in testing their corn and corn silages. Producers should have their feedstuffs and forages tested at laboratories, such as the Alltech 37+® mycotoxin analytical services laboratory, to determine if any of their silages or hay has a mycotoxin prevalence before feeding. It’s really important to discard any feed ingredients you can tell are already moldy and musty smelling and use a sequestering agent in feed to prevent and/or offset the negative effects of molds and mycotoxins. How can producers tell if there’s a high mycotoxin load? Are there any early indication signs? The big challenge when it comes to mycotoxins is that everything is dosage-dependent. Meaning, both the volume and duration of mycotoxins have a compounding effect over time. As a result, producers might not see any impact at all on day one, but don’t confuse that with thinking there isn’t an issue. It’s easy to blame a drop in performance on management or breed influences when the real problem could be right in the feed itself. Testing for mycotoxins is critical, but also let your cattle tell you what’s going on. Visually, there are a few cues: • Rough or dull hair coats • Stiff joints and/or lameness • Increases in respiratory-related incidents • Gut irritation that causes inconsistent or loose stool samples This year in particular is the right time to focus on nutrition to boost the immune system to combat the varied mycotoxin load cattle will face. Lastly, what’s the one thing the farming public needs to know about mycotoxins that they might not already know? For me, I hear lots of producers worrying about aflatoxins and testing for them, which is good, but we know there are as many 1,200 different mycotoxins overall that can potentially be in feedstuffs. What I think farmers need to know is that testing for aflatoxins alone isn’t enough. I’ve said it before, but it’s the additive or synergistic effect of mycotoxins that really causes the issue. It takes a comprehensive management strategy, including testing and feed application, to drive the health and performance of cattle. That’s what’s best for cattle and supports profitable production at the end of the day.

Their original purpose was to degrade so-called anti-nutritional molecules from grains used in feedstuffs, such as wheat, barley and wheatgrass. These grains, when used as a primary source of carbohydrates in an animal diet, presented less digestibility and nutritional content when compared with other grains such as corn and sorghum. As a result, they often led to decreases in animal performance. A brief history of enzyme use in animal feed The first enzymes developed by the biotech industry were the arabinoxylans and beta glucanases. Their function was to degrade non-starch polysaccharides, which are the fibrous portions of the grain. These enzymes reduced the viscosity of the non-digested grain in the intestine. The first trials proved that adding exogenous enzymes to wheat-based diets improved digestibility in monogastric animals. These early studies also helped scientists understand the mode of action of these enzymes and enabled them to develop new enzymes capable of working on a wider variety of substrates. At the beginning of the 1990s, the main topic of conversation among nutritionists and researchers was what they considered to be the inevitable decline of sources of phosphorus in animal feed. The additives and supplements industry responded quickly to this challenge by focusing on enzymes capable of releasing more phosphorous through a molecule usually not present in livestock animals: phytate. Fungal phytase were able to chemically breakdown the phytate, releasing additional phosphorus in feed for pigs and poultry. While the nutritional matrixes of phytase would not be consolidated until 2000, they showed promising initial values of 0.05 phosphorus and a maximum of 0.10 percent available phosphorus. The benefits of enzymes Even though there are still some segments of the pig and poultry industries that do not use exogenous enzymes, the growth of the enzyme market has been substantial. Since enzymes improve the digestibility of plant-based feed ingredients, they offer immediate economic benefits to animal production. Enzymes have allowed producers to further improve their feed conversion rates, the uniformity of their flocks and herds, and the efficiency of their feed mills since fewer grains are needed to be purchased and processed. With all these benefits available to producers, the animal nutrition industry is becoming more eager to study enzyme technology in greater depth with the aim of further optimizing animal production. Research is ongoing on the effects of degradation of different substrates, different methods of producing enzymes, epigenetic effects of enzymes in the formation and development of the intestine, and interaction with the microbiota and intestinal health, as well as their direct or indirect action on the immune system. As our understanding of enzymes evolves, we should expect a revolution in how we feed our animals.

Andhra Pradesh state is the largest producer of shrimp in India and one of the largest areas of shrimp farming in the world. Raju farms more than 80 hectares of fish culture. He started farming shrimp culture on 10 hectares two years ago after seeing a great opportunity for shrimp in the global market. Unfortunately, he lost all of his investment in shrimp culture on his first try. This is the story of how he bounced back and turned a profit with his shrimp farm. The problem: 100 percent shrimp mortality due to elephant gill disease Penaeus vannamei, also known as Pacific whiteleg shrimp, is an extensively cultured species along coastal India. Raju started farming Penaeus vannamei on 7 hectares — a single pond — in 2016. At the beginning of the season last year, Raju lost approximately $60,000 due to elephant gill disease. His shrimp’s gill appearance resembled an elephant ear. Eventually, the shrimp mortality rate was 100 percent. The shrimp’s gill appearance resembled an elephant ear due to elephant gill disease. In the second season of the year, Raju restocked his farm with fresh shrimp seed. Within 10 days, he noticed the outbreak of elephant gill disease again. Many other farms in the surrounding areas had the same problem. Strengthening the immune system to overcome shrimp health challenges Raju discovered Alltech On-Farm solutions through an aqua dealer in Eluru who introduced him to Tausif Ahmed, an Alltech assistant business development manager. Ahmad recommended using Bioplex® as well as Sel-Plex® to support immune response in shrimp. To resolve other issues related to growth, gastrointestinal health, water quality, ammonia and sludge, he recommended a range of Alltech solutions. The result Within 15 days of proper technical guidance and good management practice, 80 percent of the shrimp recovered from the disease. By the end of the season, Raju harvested 30 tons of shrimp.

While these labels can sometimes be little more than a marketing ploy, it does give an indication that consumers are looking for more natural consumables and that growers need to be aware of those consumer demands to stay relevant on the shelves. By taking a few simple steps in conjunction with existing conventional practices, growers can adhere to a more natural method of production while remaining profitable. 1. Improve the soil structure Healthy crops begin with healthy, nutrient-rich soil. The use of cover crops and crop rotation decreases nutrient depletion and increases organic matter breakdown by supporting the microbes in the soil, potentially reducing the amount of fertilizer needed to achieve the maximum growth potential of the plants. Cover crops build soil health by adding organic matter as their roots degrade into the soil, increasing nutrient retention, controlling erosion through improved stability and moisture-retaining capabilities, and reducing the number of weeds in the field, which decreases the need for herbicides. By using different crops in rotation, different types of organic matter are added to the soil, diversifying the available nutrients and microorganisms present. At planting, consider using a no-till method so as to not disrupt the soil biology and maintain the new soil that has been created. 2. Build the soil microbiome There is a delicate symbiotic relationship between the plant and the microbes that surround its root system. Microbes in the soil help plants by increasing nutrient availability and enhancing root growth. In return, these microorganisms receive the carbon that they need to grow and thrive from the plant. The same means used to improve soil structure also provide a favorable environment that enhances the soil microbiome, particularly when a naturally based fertilizer is used to promote growth and diversity in microbial populations. 3. Increase nutrient availability The use of natural substances, such as amino acids, in the chelation of micronutrients facilitates their absorption by plants as they are presented in a much more bioavailable form, meaning they are ready to be used. Plants that are well-nourished are healthier and will be better able to resist environmental stressors. 4. Naturally boost plant performance The use of biostimulants has grown exponentially in the past few years. These naturally based products help to promote functions in the plant that improve efficiency, increase performance and strengthen stress tolerance. Used as an alternative to synthetic products, growers are finding that their results in yield and quality equal or exceed those observed when using conventional practices. 5. Utilize integrated pest management Focusing on a more long-term approach to decreasing pests and other environmental stressors, integrated pest management (IPM) combines different methods, such as biological control using biopesticides and promoting induced resistance in the plant, for a more comprehensive approach to management. From a nutritional standpoint, a plant that is healthy will have a better chance of resisting disease pressure. IPM also looks at the growing environment as a whole, taking into account many factors, including current pests and their predators, irrigation and drought conditions, weed management and soil conditions. It is clear that many parts of these approaches are interconnected and will have effects on the others. Improving the soil will improve the plant, which will make it more likely to have a systemic resistance to environmental and disease pressures and will reduce the need for pesticides and other synthetic interventions.

He took the stage at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference (ONE19) to outline the four things that have forged him into the success he is today. Accepting failure Grylls noted that failure was likely the most important force behind his accomplishments, revealing that the first time he attempted to become a member of the elite Special Air Service (SAS), he failed and was sent back to his unit. At the time, he thought not making it meant he wasn’t fast enough, smart enough or simply good enough, but nevertheless, he decided to try again. Grylls remarked that he felt completely out of place among the huge, muscle-bound soldiers also attempting to join the special forces unit, and he began to worry he’d volunteered for something that was beyond his capabilities. He soon realized, however, that SAS selection was about both physical capacity and mental resilience and that, although he might be average in stature, he was mighty in spirit. “My failures far outweigh my successes,” said Grylls. “The failed expeditions, projects and near-death moments still haunt me in the night sometimes.” Grylls went on to say that it was actually these failures that eventually helped him to grow stronger, both inside and out: “There is no shortcut to avoid failure,” he said. “Failure is a doorway to success.” Facing your fears The second pillar Grylls addressed was fear, noting that “life is scary sometimes, and all of us face battles, even if (they’re just) battles of confidence and nerves.” He added that it’s a universal truth that life will test us, no matter who we are. “Life doesn’t always just reward the brilliant or the talented,” he said. “Life doesn’t really care about the exam results or good looks or the letters after someone’s name. Life rewards the dogged, the determined — those who can walk toward their goals despite their fears.” When it comes to facing fears, Grylls speaks from experience. In 1996, at the age of 21, his celebrity — and life as he knew it — was almost impeded when a skydiving adventure went terribly wrong. After jumping out of a plane with a few friends over Zimbabwe, his parachute became tangled and failed to inflate properly. Grylls desperately tried to remedy the problem by pulling on his steering toggles, but to no avail. He was descending so rapidly that, by the time he realized what terrible trouble he was in, he was too close to the ground to use his reserve chute. He ended up plunging toward the earth in a freefall, landing on his reserve parachute pack and breaking his back in three places. Though his spinal cord was very nearly severed, it remained intact. He spent the next year as an invalid, undergoing grueling rehabilitation and enduring night terrors about falling and being out of control. Still, he remained unfailingly determined and, a mere 18 months later, Grylls accomplished a lifelong dream by becoming the youngest British person ever to reach the summit of Mount Everest. “You might wonder if I’ve ever jumped again,” he said, “and the answer is: all of the time.” While he admitted that he dreads jumping, Grylls also said that he knows that the answer to fear is to face it head-on. “Life has repeatedly shown that, when we edge toward our fears, they often melt away,” he said. “I really struggle with rooms full of strangers. I think this is because I know I’m not actually as strong as people might expect, but that’s okay, because we all have our stuff — fears are just part of life, part of what makes us real and relatable. “In life, those cracks we all have are really our stories; like wrinkles, each one is a story, an adventure,” Grylls continued. “The big moments in all of our lives really leave marks and, if I’m being honest, I’m completely covered in them.” Finding the fire When outlining how we can keep moving forward against the odds, Grylls said that it comes down to learning how to access our inner fire. “You must first understand that no one is really brilliant or brave all of the time,” he argued, recalling an encouraging quote from one of his commanding officers in the military: “When not one ounce of you thinks you can, you’re the one that turns around and gives that little bit extra.” According to Grylls, inner fire is simply a trigger to “give more when most people want to give up.” “If you dig, you will find it,” he added. “The fire is always there. Sometimes in life, the fire gets a little hidden; in fact, sometimes it’s just a little ember — but it’s always there, and it can change everything.” In the course of his trek up Mount Everest, Grylls said the mountain claimed four people’s lives; two died from exposure and the others fell to their demise. They’d been climbing for more than 55 days, in negative-40-degree temperatures, with the peak of the mountain looming above. Grylls was completely exhausted and felt that every step forward was followed by a backward slide. He was no longer sure he could reach the summit, and he admits there was a voice in his head that kept telling him, “You don’t belong here. Give up.” However, instead of slowly bowing to that voice as he was initially inclined to do, Grylls found his inner fire and kept going. “This fire has been (my) most valuable weapon — not talent, not skills,” he said. “Know the power of unrelenting, unwavering resilience. The storms of life, ironically, make us strong. As with all dark nights, sometimes you’ve just got to hang in there, doggedly. The dawn will always come. The light will always win.” Keeping the faith While on Mount Everest, Grylls also found the voice of doubt in his head being silenced and drowned out by a stronger one, one that was difficult to describe but that said: “I’m with you. Lean on me. You can do this.” This was when he realized that faith in oneself and in others is the universal force of goodness. “We all face our mountain,” said Grylls. “Everest really is just a state of mind.” Achieving your dreams, Grylls continued, will mean embracing your failures along the way. “I am no hero, and I’m no stranger to crippling doubt and fear, but I know the weapons that serve me best,” he said. “They come from within, not without.” In closing, Grylls argued that the final element to success is about finding true wealth, which stems from being both grateful and kind. “I’ve climbed mountains with men who have lost their legs in war, but yet, they still smile and are grateful — (they say) look at all we have and all we’ve done,” said Grylls, who added that we must seek humility and understand our place in the universe. “Our real wealth is always going to be found in our relationships,” Grylls continued. “It’s about the simple things that keep us moving through the dark nights that we all face from time to time.” Grylls’ final remarks served as a simple note of inspiration, “Remember: you are made amazing. Stand tall, and never give up.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/4-fs-bear-grylls-failure-fear-fire-and-faith","title":"\n\n                    The 4 F’s: Bear Grylls on failure, fear, fire and faith\n                    ","date":"May 20, 2019","contentLength":1271}},{"pageContent":"While the northern hemisphere has been experiencing the wrath of the polar vortex and record cold temperatures, the southern hemisphere has been on the opposite end of the spectrum, dealing with sweltering heat. Fortunately, there are generally simple ways for humans to escape the uncomfortable effects of extreme weather — but the same cannot be said for horses, who must expend substantial energy in an effort to keep cool as temperatures rise. While you can still enjoy equestrian pursuits on relatively warm days, you will want to take extra precautions to ensure that your horse stays healthy and safe in the heat. Equine heat stress is a serious concern, and although it may first manifest in seemingly minor ways, such as poor performance, it can quickly escalate to potentially fatal heat exhaustion and stroke. As such, it is highly important to develop an understanding of the stages and signs of heat stress so that you can take immediate action if you observe them in your horses. Stage 1: The horse may sweat profusely and exhibit a heightened body temperature (the normal equine body temperature ranges from 99–101° Fahrenheit or 37.2–38.3° Celsius). The heart rate elevates significantly. A horse’s normal resting heart rate is within 30–50 beats per minute, and a pulse rate of 50 or higher is generally a cause for concern. You can also check for signs of dehydration by grasping a fold of skin at the point of the shoulder and releasing it. If the horse is well-hydrated, the skin should snap back quickly (in under one second). Generally, the longer the skin takes to flatten, the more dehydrated the horse. However, it’s important to already know what your horse’s normal skin elasticity is, as this can vary. Capillary refill time can also be used to measure hydration. To check this, press lightly on the horse’s gum just above an upper incisor and observe how long it takes for its normal pink color to return; two seconds or less is normal. Stage 2: Rapid, shallow breathing may be apparent. For reference, the normal respiratory rate for a resting adult horse is between eight and 15 breaths per minute. The horse’s behavior can become uncooperative; it may frequently kick or randomly shake its head. Minor gait abnormalities may also be observed. You may also detect an irregular, fluttery heartbeat or witness tying-up (i.e., muscle cramping as the result of the massive contraction of the muscle groups along the horse’s back and rump). Sweating has likely ceased, but the skin remains hot to the touch as body temperature rises. A body temperature between 104–108° Fahrenheit (or 40–42.2° Celsius) indicates a heightened risk of danger for the horse, as heat exhaustion is beginning to set in. Stage 3: The horse will hang its head low and appear extremely unhappy. It may also clearly be struggling to breathe normally, taking slower and deeper breaths, which is known as second-phase panting. The pulse will remain heightened but also weak and potentially irregular. Gut sounds are reduced or absent. The horse may appear confused and make increasingly clumsy movements. Stage 4: The consequences and effects of prolonged heightened body temperature (in excess of 106–108° Fahrenheit, or 41.1–42.2° Celsius) may lead to heat stroke. The central nervous system will begin to shut down, which can lead to: Severe stumbling or difficulty moving Volatile behavior Increasingly confused mannerisms Collapse Convulsions Unconsciousness or comatose state Death So, what can you do if your horse appears to be suffering from the ill effects of heat stress? Walk the horse out to encourage circulation and to bring heated blood to the surface of the skin for cooling. Let the horse drink its fill. A hot horse should take in as much water as it needs to replace what is being sweated out. Cold water is fine — the idea that letting a hot horse drink cold water can cause colic and muscle cramping is simply a myth. Splash or spray cold water directly onto the horse to aid with evaporative cooling. Despite what you may have heard, putting cold water on hot muscles does not constrict blood vessels and lead to cramping. Do make sure to frequently scrape off the water, because it will warm up quickly on the horse’s body. Repeat this process until the skin feels cool to the touch and the horse’s breathing appears to have returned to normal. If the horse’s behavior and drinking habits have not returned to normal within one hour, or if you witness more dramatic signs of heat stress within that window of time, call your veterinarian immediately. Intravenous hydration and other medical measures may be required to prevent potentially irreversible effects or loss of life.

This past month we welcomed more than 3,000 friends from 71 countries for an unbelievable week of idea-sharing and inspiration at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference. We also grew the Alltech family through the acquisition of Keenan, a leading farming solutions manufacturer known particularly for their “Green Machine” and InTouch Technology. Today it’s a delight to share further excitement as we welcome Coppens International, an innovative Dutch aquatic feed and nutrition company, to our family. READ the press release here. Coppens International is known around the world as a technical specialist that produces high-quality aquatic feeds. The Coppens International team works continuously to perfect their formulas and develop new feed to cater to market demands. They have drive, they are passionate and they care – all qualities we value here at Alltech. Coppens International’s innovative techniques provide us with a winning combination for delivering greater efficiency and profitability direct to our aquatic producers. Together we will now offer a breakthrough development in the feed industry by providing a fish feed completely derived from a sustainable and traceable fish oil replacement. With Coppens International, we complete the cycle from a sustainable source of microalgae, rich in DHA omega-3 fatty acid, through to fish feeds and into fish products. The production of our algae is based on yeast components from which the algae gain a number of critical nutrients to grow, produce the high fat content and, even more importantly, high levels of the DHA omega-3 fatty acid. This active ingredient, as in many of our other yeast-based products, ultimately improves animal and fish health, while providing DHA-rich, functional foods that deliver a wide range of well-known health benefits to consumers. Now there is a true marriage between a unique aquatic feed manufacturer and an animal health-focused algae production facility! In fact, our plant in Winchester, Kentucky is food-grade and approaching more than 20,000 tons annually, with capacity expected to triple by year-end. Using Alltech’s primacy in science combined with Coppens International team of researchers, we believe we will be one of the first to completely remove fish meal and fish oil from feed. We will replace these with Alltech’s FOR PLUS, which is derived from algae, and produced in our dedicated algae facility in Kentucky. We will be able to guarantee our customers a source of DHA which is traceable, sustainable and without the contamination issues of fish products. Just like Alltech, Coppens International is passionate about customer-centered research. In fact, they have 17 hectares of ponds devoted to research and raising specialty fish such as aquarium fish. With two dedicated extruders, the company’s products are shipped around the world, and their capacity will increase shortly with a third extruder in the coming months. In looking to the future, Dr. Karl Dawson, chief scientific officer at Alltech, said, “We will continue sharing results of the successful use of Alltech’s FOR PLUS in all animal and fish diets. We have already demonstrated some surprising benefits for production animals. At Alltech, we remain steadfastly focused on our ACE principle of being friendly to the Animal, the Consumer, and the Environment.” By joining Alltech, Coppens International is achieving one of its long-held ambitions - the replacement of fish oil with Alltech algae technology. Given the unsustainable global supply of fish oil, this is a true leap forward for their aquaculture nutrition program. In fact, did you know that we own one of the only fully-operational, large-scale algae production facilities in the world? At the Alltech Algae facility in Winchester, Kentucky, we have invested heavily to develop proprietary algal technology for application in aquaculture, pet and livestock nutrition. No longer a buzzword, algae are gaining attention for their application to the feed and food industries as a highly sustainable source of DHA omega-3, and Coppens International will now be leveraging our algal technology. We see plenty of synergies that can occur with Coppens International. Fish farms will have improved direct access to the most cutting-edge, sustainable technologies relevant to today's aquaculture industry demands. In April this year, we launched the Alltech Aquaculture Postgraduate Program, a joint research partnership with the world-renowned University of Stirling Institute of Aquaculture in Scotland, and we are also making great progress with Alltech Aquaculture in Kentucky. Again, why? We see the opportunities ahead within the exciting sector of aquaculture. The aquaculture sector is experiencing tremendous growth worldwide. In fact, did you know that aquaculture is the fastest growing segment of the animal feed industry? According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, fish consumption now exceeds beef consumption per capita, and farmed fish now exceed wild caught. What an opportunity! Together, Alltech and Coppens International will ensure that aquatic producers around the world can practice responsible and efficient aquaculture. Together, we will make a sustainable contribution to food production for a growing global population that demands the very best. It’s the opportunity of a lifetime to work hand-in-hand on delivering aquaculture solutions.

This has changed over the last few years, however, with the adoption of and investment in new technologies across a variety of areas, including irrigation, soil mobilization, pest and disease control and fertilization. One of the most significant changes dealt with the types of crops being grown by these Portuguese farmers, who began to look beyond Portugal and focus on cultivating products that could be more competitive on a European scale, including fruits and vegetables. Their farming practices have also been progressively updated to make sure that they fit in with European regulations. A greater emphasis has been placed on sustainable practices with decreased residues to ensure that the crops are marketable in areas beyond Portugal. These updated farming practices have led to an increase in productivity and competitiveness, as well as a more efficient use of resources. Over the past 20 years, 3.2 million acres — almost a third of the agricultural area under cultivation in Portugal — had been neglected, but now, there is a greater productivity of the cultivated area and a new entrepreneurial spirit driven by a new generation of farmers. A generation of farmers that was raised on a family farm is also becoming more prevalent, and with this influx of fresh eyes also comes the implementation of crop diversification. A farm where, previously, only corn was cultivated, for instance, may now also grow tomatoes, sunflowers, carrots and other crops. Rejuvenating the agricultural fabric of Portugal was imperative, since more than half of farmers in the country are older than 65. With the embrace of new technologies to meet market demands, Portuguese agriculture today is more innovative, professional, productive and customer-oriented. In 2015, Portugal ranked 41st for exports in the global agri-food industry. The main products the country exported included olive oils, tomatoes and wines. Portugal’s agricultural exports go to 153 countries, with Spain, Brazil, France, Italy and Angola as its biggest external markets. Fresh fruit accounted for 40 percent of the value of those exports, with special emphasis on small fruits, oranges and Rocha pears, which were the best performers in 2016. However, the country is also heavily dependent on cereals and oilseeds, whose import volume accounted for 42.4 percent of the total agricultural imports during 2006–2010. While Portugal is not yet seen as competitive in dryland cereal farming, the national production of irrigated grain — particularly maize — has been on the rise. The sector must continue to strengthen its exports and its presence in foreign markets, affirming the quality that sets its produce apart. Portuguese agricultural products are attractive to countries and customers looking for products from southern Europe, thanks to the mild and differentiated climate that the Atlantic Ocean provides. Portugal has a reputation for food safety and is recognized as a region whose products feature appealing colors, flavors and aromas.

Three of the most preferred French breeds are the Charolais, known for its high growth performance; the Limousine, renowned for its rearing abilities; and the Blonde d’Aquitaine, recognized for its ability to produce a high percentage of meat. With more than 4 million suckler cows, France has one of the biggest cow-calf systems in Europe. Typically, a French farmer will have both a cow-calf system and a fattening unit for heifers, cows and culled young bulls. This allows for the entire process to be completed in one place, limiting the carbon footprint. “Despite the many successes on French farms, acidosis is a challenge that often occurs in beef herds,” said Thomas Pacalier, a member of the 2015 Alltech Career Development Program. “Cattle that are fed corn silage-based diets consume a higher level of starch, which can cause them to develop acidosis. Fortunately, there are several simple steps that can be carried out to diminish the likelihood of an animal being affected.” Check the color of the horns. White is a sign that the rumen is operating at its optimum level, while red should be considered a warning sign. Take note of the animal’s behavior, as those suffering from acidosis may behave more aggressively (e.g., fighting with pen-mates). Analyze the manure; ideally, loose stools with a lot of undigested grain or fiber should be avoided. Watch how the animal walks and stands. Lameness can indicate that the rumen is not functioning at the desired level. Ensure the cattle are lying down and chewing after feeding. If less than 50 percent of the herd displays this type of behavior in the hours after eating, there may be an issue with digestion. To avoid issues such as acidosis, it is important to take a regular look at the animal and its behavioral patterns. The diet should be prepared with a mixture of starch from various sources, while rough fiber should be added to the feed in order to stimulate the rumen. Maintaining a healthy rumen is the basis for ensuring high feed efficiency levels, which allow your herd to reach its peak performance. It is important to remember that small changes to the diet or management practice can unintentionally disturb rumen health. Therefore, it is important to adapt the diet in response to the insights gained from studying the animal.

In poultry production alone, mycotoxins have been linked to mouth lesions, yellow livers, gizzard erosions and poor gut integrity. Many of the world’s biggest poultry integrators pay very close attention to their grain and feed quality because of the effects these challenges may have on poultry health and on profit margins. When it comes to organic poultry production, however, the more stringent regulations also present unique challenges. First, there is the challenge of supply and demand. According to a survey conducted in 2014 by the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service, sales of U.S. organic products have increased 72 percent since 2008. Demand for organic and non-GMO broiler chickens, turkeys and eggs is also strong and is expected to double in the next decade. In response to the increase in demand, local producers have been expanding their organic and non-GMO production. A 2016 article from WattAgNet.com summarizes the rapid growth that organic poultry has had. From 2000 to 2014, organic broiler production grew by 96 percent, organic layer flocks grew by 89 percent and turkey production grew by 35 percent. Even though the poultry industry has been very quick to respond to consumer demands, the supply of certified organic and non-GMO grains has been slower to react. The U.S. is the largest corn producer in the world, but in 2011 it was estimated that organic corn represented only 0.26 percent of production. Today, about 4 percent of food sales are organic while only 0.5 percent of U.S. farm acreage is dedicated organic. With a limited supply, buyers are often forced to accept higher levels of broken kernels and imperfections in their grain. The case for grain quality Grains with broken kernels and imperfections usually contain higher levels of molds and mycotoxins. Most of the mycotoxin-producing species of molds are soil-born fungi, which can survive and remain in fields for long periods of time. With modern agricultural practices such as no-till methods, incidences of fungal contamination appear to be increasing. The presence of corn stems and infected ears remaining on the soil surface from one year to another may serve as a source of inoculums, contributing to the increased incidence of contaminated grains (Mora and Moreno, 1984). According to Duarte et al. (2008), fungicides can reduce the incidence of Fusarium molds in corn grain, but the use of fungicides is not allowed when growing organic corn. Managing a hidden mycotoxin threat To protect our food chain, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration imposes limits for mycotoxin levels in food and feed. This was highlighted in a 2016 alert by the National Grain and Feed Association to remind everyone of the acceptable levels. To meet the standards of organic production as well as these limits, organic producers are limited in terms of mycotoxin risk management and gut health prevention tools. Management strategies and the implementation of a thorough program are necessary to prevent exposure to mycotoxins. Checking grain quality by utilizing industry-approved standards to collect samples and submitting them to a high-standard testing laboratory is a good start, followed by routine maintenance of feed mills to eliminate possible contamination in the milling process. Certified organic mycotoxin control agents in the diets should also be utilized to help prevent or offset the impacts mycotoxins can have on overall performance.

What an animal is fed can directly impact their antioxidant defense system. Incorporating dietary antioxidants and other functional feed ingredients can minimize oxidative damage, which will impact the end product (and pet food ingredient): meat. When we are talking about food, whether for people or pets, oxidative deterioration will impact palatability. Oxidative damage to lipids and proteins produces rancid off-flavors and off-odors and decreases textural characteristics. But even more importantly, when proteins are oxidized, there is a loss of important amino acids, which are necessary for pets’ growth, development and overall health. More to minerals Minerals are necessary for proper biological function and good health. They are especially important in maintaining the antioxidant and oxidant balance within humans, livestock and pets. Some key players involved in maintaining this balance are antioxidant enzymes, such as glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase. But, minerals are a double-edged sword. They can be beneficial or detrimental depending on the quantity fed and the form used. Going full circle Making sure pets get the right nutrition for optimal health means we need to look at what livestock animals are fed. Organically complexed minerals are more bioavailable than their inorganic counterparts, which means we don’t need to add as many minerals to the diet of livestock. By replacing and reducing the amount of minerals in the diet, we can restore the oxidative balance in the animal and, in turn, the meat ingredient in pet food. Research has shown that feeding organically complexed forms of selenium, iron, zinc and copper can increase antioxidant enzyme activity in skeletal muscle. Also, by including fat-soluble antioxidants, such as vitamin E and/or carotenoids, we can inhibit lipid oxidation and subsequently protein oxidation in muscle. This will translate to more nutritious, delicious and better-quality ingredients being fed to pets.

Not only has there been an increase in the demand for food, but also for a more diverse range of food. Yet, in 2015, China’s Ministry of Environmental Protection reported that 19 percent of arable land in the country was polluted. When one considers the decline in the amount of arable land due to urbanization as well as the constraints caused by pollution, there is little doubt that it will take significant effort to remediate the soil for agricultural use. In order to face the challenges of preserving farmland as well as protecting and improving the environment while promoting the sustainable development of Chinese agriculture, the Soil and Fertilizer Alliance of China (SFAC) was formed. This organization relies on the national agricultural platform for research and extension and focuses on the soil and fertilizer industry to promote the innovative integration of crop planting, livestock feeding, operating and servicing systems. When Alltech joined the SFAC, the company had already been working on research to reduce mineral outputs in animal manure through diet. This is being increasingly examined by governmental authorities, as evidenced by China’s December 2016 Environmental Tax Law addressing heavy metals and minerals, which are of particular concern for heavily polluted areas of China. “We hope that this project can help livestock farms find a more sustainable way to reduce pollution,” says Dr. Mark Lyons, Alltech’s global vice president and head of Greater China, and the vice president of the SFAC. “We are finding that the Alltech solutions are not only significantly reducing mineral release in manure, but are also decreasing heavy metal levels.” Projects such as these, combined with pollution monitoring, are an important step in reaching the country’s goal of significantly reducing soil pollution in the next five years.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/chinas-soil-reducing-mineral-and-heavy-metal-contamination","title":"\n\n                    China’s soil: Reducing mineral and heavy metal contamination\n                    ","date":"January 12, 2017","contentLength":309}},{"pageContent":"Spain’s old-world charm is infused with music, food and wine. The Alltech Crop Science (ACS) Spain Crop Tour 2016 certainly enjoyed these Spanish delights, but attendees were there for something else: Spain’s agriculture. Seventy-two tour participants representing Brazil, the United States, Canada, Morocco, Algeria, Greece and northern Spain commenced their week-long journey in southeastern Spain. They began with a visit to Primaflor, a producer of ready-to-eat salads that specializes in leafy vegetables. Primaflor farms over 14,000 acres and has been using ACS products for four years, resulting in increased quality and quantity. Inside a 7.5-acre, fully automated greenhouse, the group viewed the systems that allow the greenhouse to produce the equivalent of 22 acres’ worth of greens! The lack of water throughout eastern Spain means that producers have to be more creative in their usage and make every drop count. From Plantiagro, a seeds and seedling producer in Murcia, to Daramezas and Castrejón Alto in Toledo, which produce grapes for cognac and olives, respectively, challenges include not only overcoming issues with scarcity, but also with salinity and poor water quality. Growers are constantly looking for ways to make their farms more efficient while maintaining and increasing productivity levels, something many of the tour participants found relatable. Before ending with a day at Fruit Attraction, the largest agronomic trade show in Europe, the tour included a visit to the research fields and laboratory of Ideagro, an independent research group that has been working with ACS for years, as well as touring the table grape variety fields of ITUM and sightseeing in Murcia, Toledo and Madrid After spending a week together, the group felt like a large family. “The trip was wonderful in networking, fun and learning, but what truly makes a difference are the people we share the experience with,” noted Sebastião Rodovalho from Trisolo. “In one word, I would describe the tour as wonderful, because it makes me want to do more, learn more,” said João Garcia, who represents Casa do Adubo. “I came back excited and full of knowledge to share.” A few days later, Garcia shared his experiences from the tour with friends who were “amazed with all the information I was able to bring back,” he said. “With all that we learned during the week, Brazil and the world gained more experienced people when we returned home.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/glimpse-agriculture-spain","title":"\n\n                    A glimpse of agriculture in Spain\n                    ","date":"March 6, 2018","contentLength":403}},{"pageContent":"Vitamins are essential micronutrients required in all poultry diets, with each vitamin playing a critical role in the bird’s overall health and performance. As such, it is important to manage low-inclusion premixes to conserve vitamin stability and maintain efficacy. Vitamin class and quality All vitamins are crucial for normal biological function. Vitamins fall into two classes: fat-soluble and water-soluble. Fat-soluble vitamins (including vitamins A, D, E and K) are absorbed and stored in fatty tissues of the body. These fat-soluble vitamins are critical for vision, mucous tissue integrity, immunity and blood coagulation, as well as calcium and phosphorus metabolism. Alternatively, water-soluble vitamins (including vitamins C, B-complex and choline) are not stored within the body. Water-soluble vitamins metabolize carbohydrates, proteins and fats, and they also contribute to the integrity of skin and ligaments, bone calcification and hormone synthesis. Several physical and chemical factors — including exposure to oxygen, pressure, friction, temperature, humidity, light, pH and redox reactions — can decrease vitamin stability, which will negatively affect bird performance. Pelleting, for example, involves friction, pressure, heat and humidity, which can expose vitamins to adverse chemical environments and compromise the vitamin’s stability. Choline chloride is particularly harsh for vitamins because of its hygroscopic and alkaline properties, so separate choline chloride from vitamin premixes whenever possible. Maintaining an awareness of the storage conditions and of the overall product composition is important. The ideal conditions will be different for each vitamin. For example, vitamins B1 and B6 are more stable in acidic environments, whereas pantothenic and folic acids are more stable in alkaline environments. Vitamin B12 is sensitive to several environmental factors, including strong acids, alkali conditions and light. Providing vitamin premixes with ideal conditions but storing them alongside trace minerals can also compromise their stability. Copper, zinc and iron are the most reactive toward vitamins, while manganese and selenium tend to be the least reactive trace minerals. The form of the trace mineral can also influence its reactivity toward vitamins; sulfates and carbonates are the most reactive, while oxides and chelated trace mineral forms are the least reactive. Therefore, formulating vitamin premixes in combination with chelated trace minerals will aid in prolonging vitamin stability. Proper management techniques are critical for maintaining vitamin potency and stability. If possible, store trace minerals and vitamins separately in the initial manufacturing facilities. When combining vitamins and trace minerals in premixes, consider utilizing chelated trace minerals. Additionally, reduce the overall storage time of premixes as well as complete feed. Ensure the use of proper storage containers that minimize light and oxygen penetration. Climate-controlled storage will also reduce the risk of exposing vitamins to high environmental temperatures and humidity. Implementing these management strategies can help to ensure that we are feeding optimal-quality vitamins, which will only serve to enhance overall bird health and performance.

Cait: Can you tell me a bit about your background with horses? Gerry: I first got into horses from a riding perspective. I grew up riding ponies and later got into showjumping and really gravitated toward the industry through my love of horses. In fact, my first job involved working in the stable yard at a stud farm near where I grew up. It had 10 mares, foals and yearlings, and it was there that I met a great guy by the name of David Cunningham, who taught me about pedigrees and would take me along to sales and tell me what to look for. Everyone needs someone to take an interest in them and make them feel they are a part of something special — it’s especially important for young people to feel a connection to their workplace, and I was fortunate enough to have that. Cait: You have an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering. Given your passion for horses, I’m curious: what led you to that particular course of study? Gerry: I love engines, machinery and tractors, so mechanical engineering was always very appealing to me. At the time, I was still of the belief that horses were a hobby, and I didn’t see it as a career option for me, especially when I mucked stables for £2.50 an hour as a kid! I was close to graduation when the owner of the farm I was working for mentioned the possibility of going to work at his farm in Kentucky. At the same time, a friend of mine had just been accepted into the Godolphin Flying Start Program, so I investigated and decided to apply. I had no expectation of being selected but was lucky enough to be chosen to participate, and it really opened my eyes to the possibilities of working in the industry. Cait: Can you explain more about the Flying Start Program? Gerry: It’s a two-year full scholarship program sponsored by the owner of Godolphin, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Dubai. It gives young people an amazing opportunity to start a career in the Thoroughbred industry and to travel the world. I worked at operations in Ireland, as well as the U.S., England, Australia and Dubai, spending three to six months in each location. In Ireland, the primary focus is on breaking yearlings and attending sales. In the U.S., you participate in the northern hemisphere breeding season and, in Australia, you participate in the southern hemisphere breeding season. You spend January through March in Dubai for racing at the World Cup Carnival. While in England, you spend a great deal of your time in Newmarket, during which time the Tattersalls breeding stock sales are going on. Cait: Circling back to your education and clear passion for the industry, I wondered if you ever considered studying something related to horses, animal science or husbandry instead? Gerry: No. At the time, equine programs were still in their infancy, so I couldn’t really see a career path there. My career has developed somewhat organically; I think it takes time to realize what you are truly passionate about. Cait: You have an MBA as well. How do you put this and your mechanical engineering degree to work in your current position? Gerry: What is engineering? People think of design, structures and mechanisms, but really, engineering is just problem-solving. Engineers take problems and break them down into smaller objectives. They then develop strategies to help achieve those objectives. Engineering has helped me to see life through that lens; I’m probably as much of a strategist and developer as I am anything else. My MBA has helped advance my leadership training, and I have enjoyed developing a family/community environment in the workplace, where the responsibility is shared. It’s my job to explain what our objectives are and ensure that everyone is working with the same end goals in mind. I work with the mindset that I’m not there because I know everything and have all the great ideas — I’m there to help develop those ideas. Great things happen when nobody cares who gets the credit. Cait: What drew you to Godolphin specifically? Gerry: They were the best at what they did. It’s important to try and surround yourself with those who are the best in their trade and learn from them. It was also very important to me to work for someone who has a shared set of values, and I really believe in what Sheikh Mohammed does; he wants to better people’s lives and raise industry standards. We are always working toward a level of excellence and strive to do things for the right reasons, in the right way. Ultimately, we’re not trying to sell people anything but are simply trying to help them achieve their goals. Cait: How did participating in the Flying Start Program help you achieve success in your current role? Gerry: It was instrumental in giving me the tools, skills and opportunities to reach my full potential. The program has really evolved since I participated; it’s transformed from a management program into more of a leadership program. The course mimics the lifestyle of a high-functioning CEO, in my book — there are a lot of early mornings and late evenings and you must maintain a very demanding and busy schedule. It really prepares people well for not only getting into the industry but excelling in leadership roles within it. We have had over 140 graduates from the program to date, and less than 10 percent go to work for Godolphin directly, though I know all the graduates and work closely with them on industry issues. It’s a completely benevolent initiative, not a recruitment tool. Sheikh Mohammed wants people to help sustain Thoroughbred breeding and racing. A lot of people say the Flying Start Program will be his greatest gift to the industry. Cait: Finding — and keeping — good help on the farm is becoming increasingly challenging. How do you combat this issue? Gerry: I try to take a long-term view of things, and I do my best to create a culture and workplace where people are given opportunities to learn and develop their skillset. We strive to maintain a happy work environment, where people are treated fairly and with respect and can feel that they contribute to our overall success. Whether my staff continue working with Godolphin or end up working outside of our company in the future, I want to prepare them well, and I see this strategy working. We are fully staffed with excellent individuals and are presently turning down good people simply because we don’t have any vacancies. Most people don’t quit a job over a dollar or two; they quit because they are unsatisfied. People tend to be motivated by upward progression. I encourage a lot of personal goal-setting and planning, focused on value-based goals rather than material-based ones. I ask people to reflect on what sort of person and influence they want to be. In my experience, if you can sort that out, success will follow. Cait: At Alltech, we are always interested in learning about industry innovations. Can you tell me about the technologies you use on the farm? Gerry: Yes. Something our IT team has recently developed is an internal stud app. It has really helped provide a lot of information for our farm managers whilst out in the field. It’s great to have detailed records at your fingertips that can help you make informed decisions when you’re out in the barns. The industry is slowly embracing technologies such as genotyping to help make better breeding decisions and placement of horses with trainers, etc. Overall, though, the Thoroughbred industry is slow to embrace technology. It really comes down to finding a balance between applicable technologies that help us — as opposed to things that are novel and exciting but cost a lot of money and aren’t really that beneficial — either by making things more efficient or aiding in better decision-making. We’re evolving by looking into more natural, alternative methods of care for the horses; we utilize chiropractors, acupuncturists, nutritionists and even a naturopath. With Thoroughbreds, I feel it’s very much about doing the small things right, with attention to detail — doing the simple things to a very high standard. Cait: As both a previous and current owner of an off-track Thoroughbred, I’m especially impressed with your aftercare program. Can you tell me a little more about it? Gerry: Yes. It’s called the Godolphin Lifetime Care Program, and there are multiple components to it. We are very supportive of retirement foundations globally, but we also have our own farm in England — where most of our horses reside — which is geared toward retraining and rehoming horses. Our staff works to match people up with a horse that will suit their needs, and we gift the animal to the adopter after a suitable match is determined. Outside of England, we have retirement horses in each country we work in, so we operate a small aftercare program in each. As for our retired broodmares, they get to live out their days with us for as long as they are comfortable, healthy and happy. Cait: What is the most enjoyable aspect of your job? Gerry: Simply being around these animals. To me, horses are truly the most noble of all creatures. The relationships people can develop with them are incredible, and I’ve learned a great deal from them. I'd like to receive more horse-related news and information.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/qa-talking-gerry-duffy-stud-manager-godolphin","title":"\n\n                    Q&A: Talking with Gerry Duffy, stud manager at Godolphin\n                    ","date":"June 10, 2019","contentLength":1667}},{"pageContent":"It takes 1,000 years to naturally create 1 inch of topsoil. Now consider that over 20 percent of soils worldwide have been degraded through agricultural practices. Resting the land for thousands of years is not a realistic response to soil degradation. However, a viable solution may be found in agricultural management practices that are focused on retaining and repopulating the soil with beneficial microorganisms that improve soil health and quality. “It is paramount for the grower to understand the intricacies of the soil-plant relationship,” explains Ney Ibrahim, director of Alltech Crop Science Brazil. Reestablishing soil health Plant health starts from the ground up. When growers use practices that promote the reestablishment of the biological balance in the soil, such as cover crops, crop rotation and natural fertilizers, this improves the interactions between soil and plant. These practices can help decrease negative plant response to environmental stressors and increase productivity. Microbiological management gives life to the soil and increases nutrient availability that the plant can then use to enhance its root growth and possibly increase immunity and disease suppression. Meanwhile, organic matter is returned to the soil, creating a positive cycle for future crops and leaving a legacy of sustainability for the new generation of growers.

Many pet owners consider their pets part of the family. As a result, they are choosing higher quality, more nutritious diets for their pets and asking how the right nutrients can prolong their pet’s well-being. Oxidation and inflammation are the main culprits that can jeopardize the immune system. Making sure that the nutrients delivered as antioxidants and anti-inflammatories are biologically available and absorbable helps ensure that pets are prepared for the excess stress that comes with the aging process. In our recent webinar, “Immuno-nutrition: Structure function benefits and well-being for pets,” Dr. Rebecca Delles explored how oxidation and inflammation, when left unchecked, can result in damage to important biomolecules in the body. Older and/or sick pets may have increased needs for certain biomolecules due to lower GI absorption rates. Many of the most common diseases in pets are caused by inflammation and oxidation of the tissues.

A better understanding of genetics, nutrition and substantial research have all played a significant role in improved performance, reproduction and overall swine health. So, it begs the question: Have swine housing and management technologies kept pace with the modernization of today’s pig? According to Steve Toft, Hubbard Feeds swine specialist, they have. We sat down with Steve at the 2018 World Pork Expo to collect his insights. What’s new in housing, equipment, technology or swine management that’s leading to improved performance and animal comfort? In wean-to-finish barns, there seems to be greater focus and a higher level of intensive care given in the first few weeks after arrival. Examples include: Brooders: These lamps are designed to increase comfort and growth rates in pigs by keeping them warm and reducing stress. Comfort mats: This addition can significantly reduce the number of pigs commonly lost during farrowing by keeping crates warm, dry, safe and clean. Gruel feeders: This type of feeder is commonly considered the fastest and best way to get problem fallback pigs eating and drinking properly after weaning. Nipple bars: This innovation provides an extra water source for pigs starting on wet/dry feeders. Pulling pigs: Pigs that are falling behind in terms of weight or health are removed from their group and placed in the fallback pen, so they can receive more specialized care. Multiple hand feedings are also being conducted several times per day in an effort to stimulate pigs and get them onto feed quickly. Drip valves with nozzles above the cup waterers are also helping to provide ample, cool and fresh water to pigs for the first few days after arrival. Historically, ad-lib sow feeding — where, as the name implies, the sow can manage her own consumption — in lactation has been a successful tool for maximizing sow performance. Manufacturers are improving these feeders to make them easier to manage and utilizing sensors and electronic controls to monitor intake. Farrowing crate flooring has also come a long way with cast iron and tribar. This modern flooring features larger, solid, flat surfaces (compared to woven wire), which provide better sow comfort. LED lights have made a dramatic improvement to swine barn lighting in the last few years, saving electricity and providing a safe, well-lit environment for both pigs and herdsmen. In addition, better transport trailers have been designed for pigs, which lowers stress while loading/unloading and during transport. They have improved ramps and doors, better airflow and floors for traction, are well-lit and have on-board cooling systems. What management strategies are producers implementing to create the best environment for their pigs? Air filtration: Producers are investing in sow barn filtration technology, especially in moderately hog-dense areas. This has been helping to reduce the spread of disease. Ventilation: New control systems are available, which provide more information, are considered failsafe, and offer remote monitoring capabilities to ensure optimal environmental conditions. There is also a trend of increasing ventilation rates when feeding high, lean, fast-growing genetics. Tunnel-ventilated barns are the most common type. These facilities utilize ceiling inlets and fans to create uniform air distribution to aid in cooling pigs down during warm weather. These are just a few examples of the many ways that producers and industry experts are working to keep swine management practices up to date. Perhaps you found yourself nodding in agreement with the practices utilized on your farm or maybe you discovered some new ideas that might improve your operation. Animal husbandry is certainly fast-evolving and I expect this trend to continue for years to come.

As cattle try to beat the summer temperatures and still gain efficiently, the bottom line for producers is at stake. Take a look at these tips to ensure you are optimizing your feed efficiency for the second half of 2016. 1. Define “efficiency” appropriately Choosing an exact and agreed upon definition for “efficiency” among producers is never easy. Should an efficient operation simply focus on increasing the output of carcass weight compared to days on feed? Or should metrics, such as overall cost of gain, feed conversion ratio or overall feed costs, play a more significant role in determining true profitability? Though there will be disagreement among producers, there are two appropriate features constant in defining an efficient operation. The first is determining what exactly is the total sum of inputs needed to drive a specific output, and if that could be done better (the most basic definition of efficiency). Unfortunately, many of these may be unseen or unknown by a producer, such as more efficient management techniques, new technologies to implement or unforeseen environmental concerns, among many others. The second part of an efficient operation is to ensure that current practices promote a viable and profitable system for the foreseeable future. Producing “efficiently” with diminishing returns in the long run only hurts the industry as a whole. 2. Use technology to manage your diet Using technology to promote efficiency is a constantly growing opportunity for producers. At Alltech, recent developments in regard to in vitro fermentation have yielded encouraging news. The Alltech® In Vitro Fermentation Model (IFM) is a diagnostic tool that simulates rumen fermentation and evaluates the nutritional value of a total mixed ration in terms of digestibility and end products of fermentation. Recently, demonstrations have been done using IFM to test the nutritive quality of pasture grasses in Florida. Test samples of grass were sent to the Alltech IFM lab in Brookings, South Dakota, and were tested both with and without the Alltech® Feed Efficiency technology, Fibrozyme®. Fibrozyme is a unique hemicellulose-degrading enzyme that enhances the rate of digestion in the rumen of beef cattle. The enzyme technology in Fibrozyme holds the key to unlocking challenges associated with fiber digestibility. Functionally, what the IFM shows is that, when used in a ration, Fibrozyme can immediately begin breaking down the cell wall fraction of plant fiber in the rumen environment. This quick action jump-starts fiber digestion by providing bacteria with both easily available nutrients and easier access to other plant structures. These types of technologies and feeding models can help producers drive efficiency for their operations. 3. Know what lies ahead 2017 will be marked as a year of major changes in the beef industry. On Jan. 1, 2017, the Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) will be implemented in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration to apply veterinary oversight to a broad range of products used in animal feed, such as antibiotics. The VFD will be implemented to promote the judicious use of antibiotics in an effort to safeguard public health by limiting the development of antibiotic resistance. This will restrict any antibiotic use for growth promotion or feed efficiency. Once the changes are in full effect, it will be illegal to use medically important antibiotics without a veterinary prescription and they will only be available for use to prevent, control or treat a specifically identified disease. This is important to efficiency because, as cattle are placed either in feedlots or on pasture-based programs, certain technologies during their feeding cycle may be removed and their diet will change. These changes could affect efficiency in a negative way. Producers need to plan ahead and begin to look at alternative production methods that promote profitable efficiency in line with the VFD regulations. 4. Get more for your efforts Efficiency doesn’t just mean getting the most from your cattle; it also means finding markets and opportunities that help you get the highest return on your investment. Be selective in choosing the best suppliers and accreditations. Know the expected return on investment and aggressively pursue these premiums for your cattle. Remember, feed represents up to 70 percent of your operations costs — make the most out of every dollar you spend. Alltech recently partnered with Where Food Comes From, the parent company of IMI Global, and became their first Feed Verified partner. Fifteen Alltech technologies were verified through this program for clear, direct use in all verified natural, antibiotic-free, Non-Hormone Treated Cattle (NHTC), GAP certified and Non-GMO Project Verified programs. Producers using these technologies can now efficiently benefit from the premiums found from supplying cattle to the European Union or other specialty markets. 5. Continue to ask around! Lastly, but certainly not least, continue to look around and ask questions on how production can be done better, especially in the hot summer heat when cattle stress is at its highest. At Alltech, we are taking these challenges head-on through a series of informative, free webinars for producers. Listen to a recording of our most recent webinar here, which focused on: Understanding how to spot the signs of heat stress in beef cattle. Learning how nutrition can impact heat stress. Implementing strategies to manage heat stress. Improving overall cattle performance. For more information on these strategies, contact your Alltech representative or visit www.alltech.com/beef.

As temperatures begin to rise and snow begins to melt, we need to keep watch for changes in our stored forages. As many will remember, the corn silage harvest last fall brought with it plenty of challenges. Most dairies have not yet experienced any of the issues that are expected to arise in their silage piles thanks to those harvest challenges — but spring will change that. As temperatures increase, wild yeast will begin to awaken in silages, leading to a decrease in forage stability, as well as the potential for issues with the total mixed ration (TMR) fed to livestock. Last fall, high yeast levels were found in the fresh corn silage samples collected for the Alltech Harvest Analysis – North America (HANA). I have not seen many stability issues for silages yet, but they will manifest. As the warmer weather awakens the wild yeast, we will start to notice activity in our silages that was not present during the long, cold winter. When wild yeast is active in silage piles, it begins to feed on the energy from the corn silage, decreasing the energy available to livestock. Wild yeast can create many issues for a dairy, from decreasing forage stability to causing rumen upset at feeding. Additionally, the silage will begin to warm, leading to an increased pH and spoilage on the silage face, top and sides of the pile or bunker. This is especially true when Mucor and Penicillium molds are present. If these changes go unnoticed in the forage storage unit and the silage is fed, symptoms will begin to appear in the barn. Common symptoms of active wild yeast being fed in silage include inconsistent and loose manure, decreased dry matter intake (DMI), a downturn in the farm’s butterfat test and, of course, reduced milk production. Wild yeast has a negative impact on rumen function and cow performance. When this happens, I am often asked, “What can we do about this?” Common symptoms of active wild yeast in dairy: Loose, inconsistent manure Decreased butterfat Decreased milk production Decreased dry matter intake TEST THE FEED First, evaluate and address the issues and concerns at the silage face. Whether your corn silage is stored in a silo, a bag, a bunker or a drive-over pile doesn’t matter; if the environmental conditions allow for it, wild yeast and spoilage can occur in any storage unit. If you think wild yeast is present, my first suggestion is to test the feed through a local lab, as this will give you clear answers about the levels and the specific types of contamination you are facing. MANAGE YOUR STORAGE UNIT PROPERLY The next step is to evaluate the silage face, looking specifically for any visible signs of heating or spoilage. This can be done by the producer and nutritionist, but an Alltech on-farm representative can also help identify any potentially concerning signs by using a thermal imaging camera. If any heating or spoilage is detected, an improvement in face management will be necessary. This can be accomplished by increasing removal rates from the face and keeping the face smooth and clean by using a facer. I have personally seen many producers not using their facer daily in the winter months due to the extreme cold, and while this is understandable, when the weather warms and becomes more spring-like, using a facer will be critical to minimizing the effects of wild yeast and spoilage. DISCARD SPOILED FEED Next, do not be afraid to discard suspicious forage and spoiled feed. I understand that producers do not want to be wasteful by throwing away feed every day, but if poor-quality forage is fed to our livestock, their performance will be negatively impacted. FEED A LIVE YEAST Lastly, feeding a quality live yeast like YEA-SACC® can help livestock overcome the adverse effects of wild yeast. Yea-Sacc bolsters the rumen by modulating the pH, scavenging oxygen, eliminating stress brought on by the wild yeast strains and enhancing overall rumen function. These benefits keep livestock performance on track and allow the animal to utilize the forages efficiently.

Calculating FCR is as simple as taking the total amount of feed consumed by the flock and dividing it by the amount of weight gained or the number of eggs produced. In other words, FCR equals input divided by output. For broiler producers, an FCR of 1.6 means that their chickens gain 1 kilogram of weight for every 1.6 kilograms of feed consumed. The lower the FCR, the more efficient animals are at converting feed into food. Since the 1980s, poultry producers have been able to reduce their feed conversion ratios from producing a bird weighing 2 kilograms in 70 days with an FCR of 2.5 to a bird weighing the same in 29 days with an FCR of 1.5 today. This means that fewer grains are being used to produce more meat and eggs. The industry made this leap using two key strategies: genetic improvements and the inclusion of exogenous enzymes. Exogenous enzymes allow producers to get more energy, phosphorus and amino acids from their diets, and the international unit for measuring enzyme activity is the katal. The katal represents 1 mol of substrate per second; however, the most valued unit for comparative purposes in the animal industry is the amount of the enzyme in milligrams needed to catalyze the reaction of a particular substrate, releasing 1 micromol of a final product in one minute. It is far more difficult for producers to determine the effect a particular enzyme will have on their flock’s efficiency. Most producers will need to run field trials in order to see how the inclusion of a particular enzyme will impact their FCR. These trials can be complicated, due to the number of variables involved, and they can be very expensive, too. Being able to measure how effective a particular diet is at providing nutrients for digestion before it is fed to the animals can give a great advantage to poultry producers. Tools like Alltech True Check™ in vitro screening can allow producers to do just that. True Check simulates poultry digestion in the lab utilizing samples of feed. This tool mimics the real life conditions of the animal’s digestive system and shows producers the amount of nutrients that are being released for digestion. With True Check, producers can do side-by-side comparisons of multiple feeding strategies and choose the one that will minimize their FCR and improve their flock’s performance the most. Measuring and projecting performance allows poultry producers to choose the feeding strategy that reduces their feed costs and, as a result, gives them the best chances for increasing profitability. After all, the industry can only improve what it can measure.

A calcium deficiency can result in leaf and fruit loss and cause cracking of the fruit peel, directly impacting the fruit’s market value for the producer. To ensure proper development, it is fundamental to be vigilant of the citrus plant’s calcium needs. Marcos Revoredo, an Alltech Crop Science technical manager who specializes in fruits and vegetables, notes that, in addition to using calcium when performing soil management, it is important for the citrus grower to make foliar applications of the nutrient. “We know that calcium has a very low rate of translocation,” said Revoredo. “That is why when it is foliarly applied, whether during the vegetative, reproductive or fructification phases, we can maintain the necessary quantities for improved plant development.” This practice has already been adopted by Miltom Boveloni, an orange grower in Mogi Mirim in the state of São Paulo, Brazil. According to the grower, when you’re looking for productivity, calcium is one nutrient that cannot be forgotten. “In citriculture, we use a lot of calcium, and we always need to make those corrections,” said Boveloni. “I have noticed greater plant development and fruit set, as well as an increase in production.” Revoredo also notes that the macronutrient is a part of various plant structures, which makes it extremely important for foliar growth, pollination and fructification. “Calcium is present in the cell wall of various plant tissues such as leaves, pollen tubes and even in the fruit. It is used in the formation of these structures,” said Revoredo. “It is important to maintain the necessary quantities for the leaves, stem, flowers and fruit to develop.” Physiologically, calcium is linked to metabolism and aids in stress reduction for the plant. Because calcium favors constant photosynthetic activity, the leaf can generate more energy to sustain the flower and, consequently, the future fruit.

Properly managing these resources can help reduce the struggle brought on by the current markets. For all producers, one of the most important resources is farm labor. While it may not be easy to find people willing to work long hours — especially long hours of performing the physically demanding task of milking cows — we should make every effort to attract and retain people to work on our dairies. Although this is not an easy task, with the right conditions and the right tools, employees will see the dairy industry as a unique place that supports and cares about them. First, dairy producers and industry supporters must change their mindset about human resources and start dedicating time and effort to this area, regardless of the size of their dairies. This does not require a big investment, but it does require time and securing the right information about how to reduce the challenges around labor and the workforce. Attracting and retaining employees is not a new problem, but the current circumstances are different than before, mainly driven by immigration challenges and competition for labor with other industries. The ability to attract and retain employees is not complex, but to be successful, one must take into consideration and embrace the basics of working with people. The following formula is a concept that empowers a good work environment and creates good company culture: R = Recruit using a structured system T = Train to educate and motivate R2 = Reinforce and review, investing in the future B = (Offer) benefits that are inclusive and beneficial for both parties To create a positive culture on a dairy, the organizational basics must be in place, and there should also be a reset in the way employees are managed. R.E.S.E.T1 the business to create the right organizational structure for reducing turnover and minimizing employee management frustrations. RULES AND REGULATIONS The EMPLOYEE HANDBOOK is the first and most important part of any hiring process. Don’t think of this as just another piece of paper for new employees to read and sign; instead, think of the handbook as an opportunity to share some of the most important information with a new employee, including the history of the farm and the farm culture and expectations. The handbook is also a way to show new employees how the dairy cares for the individuals who are part of making an operation successful. This is an opportunity for new employees and dairies to get to know one another — and also to realize that both the dairy owner and their employees share something in common: the desire to work to support a family. EDUCATE AND INFORM Now that the individual has been hired and knows his or her expectations, take this opportunity to train him or her correctly, and make sure that he or she understands the protocols and procedures in place. The best way to train new employees is by explaining the “why’s” and “how’s” behind any procedure, because they value this information. Take the time to invest in training and utilize the proper communication channels, such as training videos, educational posters, internal meetings, hands-on demonstrations or external training resources from individuals with experience in teaching and motivation. SOCIAL AND CULTURAL ENGAGEMENT Individuals like being part of a society that provides a culture of inclusion, and they also enjoy feeling and knowing that they are integral to that society. A culture can be defined in so many ways, and every business should define their own. Creating and maintaining a culture of respect, communication, safety and security, among other traits, should be important to each dairy in order to attract and retain employees. By not providing a clean environment for employees to eat in, for instance, or bathrooms that represent a culture of caring, the dairy may send a discouraging message to individuals looking for a place where they intend to remain employed long-term. In the same way that dairies invest in animal comfort and environment, it is also important to provide a safe, clean, inclusive and respectful environment for employees. ECONOMIC INCENTIVES Economic incentives are important, but they should be tailored based on clear goals and the reality of the economy of each dairy operation. Incentives, such as bonuses based on SCC, must be clear and clearly understood by employees, and every incentive should be given with meaningful intentions. Don’t just give a bonus; rather, explain the reason behind the bonus and make sure employees understand those goals. Celebrate success with them. Incentives need to be visible, accessible and achievable. TOOLS PROVIDED Always provide the right tools to achieve the assigned jobs. A common example of this guideline not being met is when employees are asked to perform a consistent milking routine in the parlor, although some of the milking units are not properly working — and perhaps haven’t been for some time. How can stalls be properly cleaned and groomed if barn technicians don’t have the right tools to perform this job? Always provide the necessary tools, not only for the purpose of getting the job done but also to earn respect from employees. Finally, view your dairy as any other strategic business, for which human resources are highly important. Sell the dairy’s image to attract new employees and maintain a reliable workforce. Remember to INNOVATE, INCLUDE, INVEST and IMPLEMENT programs with employees in mind.

Dairy cows have the ability to transform fibrous plant materials and byproducts into high-quality milk, but the rumen microbes require available protein to perform these fiber digestion functions. Protein prices in the last month have continued to rise, and many dairy producers are now looking at ways to reduce their out-of-pocket costs and feed more of their housed forage, which typically represents 50 to 70 percent of the total mixed ration. The rumen bacteria need ammonia-nitrogen In order to keep the rumen bacteria working more efficiently, an effective source of ammonia-nitrogen (NH3-N) is needed to enhance fiber-digesting bacteria. Research has shown that the bacteria in the rumen primarily use NH3-N in the ruminal fluid, which is derived from a non-protein nitrogen (NPN) source in the feed. Possible nitrogen sources in the dairy ration Feed-grade urea is a common form of NPN used in dairy rations, but because of rapid ammonia release, it leads to nitrogen inefficiency and wasted energy in the dairy cow. Vegetable protein sources, such as soybean meal and canola meal, can also be a source of slow-release nitrogen, but these ingredients can have variability in nutrient composition and take up valuable space in the ration. Many producers are trying to find ways to make the ration more energy dense, especially during periods of heat stress, and feeding less bulky ingredients may help to achieve this goal. Optigen® is a unique protein alternative that is 256 percent equivalent crude protein from NPN and provides a sustained release of NH3-N in the rumen. This slow release allows for better synchronization with microbial protein needs while dramatically increasing nitrogen efficiency in the dairy cow. The key is to synchronize the ruminal carbohydrate and crude protein degradability in the rumen to increase microbial protein production and energy derived from rumen microbes. A combination of effective protein sources available in the rumen and post-ruminally — matching essential amino acids in the small intestine — has the potential to increase the cow’s efficiency. How does Optigen work? Many rations can implement up to 6 ounces of Optigen and allow for some removal of protein from vegetable protein sources, such as soybean meal. For example, 6 ounces of Optigen provides 0.9 pounds of protein, which will replace 1.9 pounds of soybean meal, with space for 1.5 pounds of dry matter of corn silage. This will create space in the ration, which will allow the dairy producer to utilize more forage in the ration and to lower out-of-pocket costs. In a recent trial done at the University of Wisconsin (Journal of Dairy Science 02, Suppl. 1, 290), 16 commercial dairy farms in Wisconsin incorporated Optigen into the ration and removed soybean meal. The space that it created was filled with corn or corn silage. The results show a 1-pound milk production response. You can find the full article on this research here.

During this time, farmers have faced a number of unique challenges but have adopted new technologies to address them. One issue, however, remains a key concern and a continually developing threat: disease. There have been significant advances in vaccination practices over the years, but the diversity of pathogens — bacterial, viral and parasitic — sometimes makes vaccination impractical or unavailable to protect against certain threats. Building a defense Pathogens are opportunistic and exist naturally in all environments, including animal populations. When conditions become suboptimal and/or stressful, the natural defenses of the animal are challenged and pathogens are given the chance to flourish, which often leads to disease, poor performance and mortality. Disease does not occur in isolation; rather, it is the result of multiple factors. Diet is just as important for the nutrition and welfare of aquaculture species as it is for humans. The Mediterranean diet, for instance, is recommended to help prevent disease in humans because it includes a rich variety of essential nutrients, such as omega-3 lipids, minerals, vitamins and proteins. These nutrients have also proven to be essential for supporting the health and welfare of livestock and often help producers achieve operational success. As such, Alltech has begun exploring what benefits these nutrients could provide in its advanced nutritional aquaculture solutions. Minerals presented in their natural, organic form help ensure optimal tissue reserves. When encountering a stressful situation, animals draw on these reserves to prevent cellular damage. The maintenance of a healthy gut helps ensure optimal nutrient uptake, leading to improved growth and performance. A healthy gut and mucosal barrier can also keep pathogens from passing through the damaged areas of the gut and into the bloodstream, thus improving the animal’s natural immune defenses. Feed selection and management As feed costs can account for more than 50 percent of farm production costs, the correct choice of feed should not be underestimated, nor should it be limited to the application of modern nutritional engineering. Feeds must also be tailored to each species and/or hybrid and should be appropriate for the specific culture methodology and environment; when feeds do not meet these standards, they are often not the most cost-effective selection for the farmer. When selecting feed, fish farmers should pay attention to three key characteristics: structure, size and stability. Visually, the structure of the pellet should be firm and robust. A strong pellet must withstand the manufacturing and transportation process, minimizing the amount of dust produced. Dust is extremely harmful to fish, as it can damage their gills and affect the water quality. The size, ratio and sink/float speed of the feed must also be suitable for different species and environments; for example, fish in RAS facilities and fish in ponds will have very different requirements. Pellets must also have a high water stability, as uneaten feed can contaminate the water and leach nutrients. Following best practices, uneaten pellets must be removed promptly in order to avoid sub-optimal feeding practices, negative environmental impacts and an increased feed conversion rate. The mechanical filter in an RAS facility will remove large and firm feces. However, providing a feed that is not suitable for this environment can result in the production of excess waste, reduced nutrient uptake and poor water quality. Profitability relies on optimized feed conversion ratios. Fish are sensitive to external factors; fluctuating water temperatures, water quality and oxygen levels can impact growth and performance. Tailored nutritional solutions Alltech Coppens, a leading developer and producer of fish feeds, performs digestibility trials on feed formulations to understand how raw materials interact with each other and affect certain characteristics. Once the ideal ingredient selection is chosen and combined with Alltech’s nutritional solutions, a diet is formulated and developed specifically for that species and its farming environment. Alltech’s aquaculture solutions platform has been proven to help maintain a protective balance between the aquaculture species, nutrition and environment. In addition, Alltech’s Mineral, Gut Health and Mycotoxin Management programs provide holistic management practices for addressing the key challenges outlined above.

The global population has now reached 9.6 billion people and is increasing every day. You turn on the television, and once again the news turns to how we need the equivalent of three planets in order to feed this unprecedented population. Is the world ready for this type of reality? Through the use of sustainable practices and precision agriculture, the answer could be a resounding “yes!” In October 1945, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations was created, with one of the key goals being to effectively manage the global food system. To celebrate the founding of the organization, World Food Day was created, and this year, the 71st anniversary, the theme is “Climate is changing. Food and agriculture must, too.” Dr. Steven Borst, general manager of Alltech Crop Science, believes that biotechnology, as an evolving science, is paramount to tackling the challenges of sustainable development. In 1987, The United Nations defined sustainability as “development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.” “Having the ability to understand, influence and obtain immediate feedback on how we can assist and maintain the maximum potential inherent to each crop could unlock the keys to yield increases as well as abiotic and biotic stress resistance in ways that we could not imagine,” said Borst. In order to feed this growing population, we will have to work together at every level: global, local and individual. “Regardless of which category you fall under, utilizing sustainable approaches to maximize yields and quality will assist with ensuring that we maintain the successes we have already gained in this battle,” continued Borst. To bring the goal of sustainably and feeding 9.6 billion people one step closer to reality, new tools and management practices will be needed. We must be able to do more with less, while improving and maintaining food quality. Alltech Crop Science utilizes unique technologies that stem from research. By strengthening natural plant processes and providing precise micronutrient availability, crops are better able to withstand environmental stresses and reach their maximum genetic potential in yield and quality. The increasing use of precision agriculture also enables today’s growers to pinpoint areas under stress. By targeting fertilizer and other input applications only to the affected areas, growers can improve their environmental footprint and even their bottom line. These new technologies could lead to a 2050 that’s more sustainable for our world, our food production and the operations of the modern grower.

Be sure to visit her bio by clicking above on the author link for more information. Thanks, Caroline! Whenever I tell people I’m an agricultural journalist, I always brace myself for the barrage of questions that invariably follow. “Do you just write about cows all day?” is a common place to start, usually followed by: “Are there enough farmers in the U.K. that they need their own newspaper?” If the person I’m speaking to is a bit rude (which, sadly, happens quite often), they’ll even ask: “You write about farming? Didn’t you want to be a proper journalist?” For the majority of people who live and work in a city, agriculture is a little-known industry. As long as the shelves are stocked when they nip to Sainsbury’s after work, few people think about where their food comes from, let alone how it’s produced. From urban life to an unexpected career in agricultural journalism It’s an issue I can speak on from experience. I grew up in a city, studied journalism at university and ended up writing about farming purely by accident. Before I became a farming journalist, the closest I’d come to agriculture was once buying eggs from a farm shop and hearing The Wurzels on the radio. But once I got into the industry, I was fascinated by all the stories there were to tell, and I became determined that I was going to share them with as many people as possible. From covering government policies, environmental issues, and business and economics to livestock production and crop science, I love the breadth of what I get to write about. I also love the chance I have to tell people about the work and passion that goes into producing the food we eat. For too long, the focus has been on getting our food to be as cheap as possible without really thinking about the consequences, not just to farmers’ businesses, but also to the environment and the public’s health. I see my job as being not only to inform farmers about the developments in their industry to help them drive more efficient, profitable businesses, but also to help build that lost connection between farmers and their customers. Critical questions represent an opportunity to “agvocate” It’s a belief that I know many agricultural journalists around the world share. Over the past decade, my job has taken me across Europe and further afield to countries including India, Australia, Canada, Tanzania and the United States to report on farming issues and meet other agri-journalists. Without fail, I’m always struck by the fact that not only does every country’s farming industry have similar concerns and issues, but every single producer and agri-journalist shares the same passion for what they do. So, yes, it may not seem like a quirky job to an outsider, but I see every one of the daft questions they ask as an opportunity to tell them about how great the industry is. And if I can say I spent this past summer travelling through Germany, Italy and France meeting some fascinating people and learning about some incredible businesses, then I’m happy I decided against being a “proper journalist.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/caroline-stocks-urban-life-agricultural-journalism","title":"\n\n                    Caroline Stocks: From urban life to agricultural journalism\n                    ","date":"November 7, 2016","contentLength":558}},{"pageContent":"“If we could give every individual the right amount of nourishment and exercise, not too little and not too much, we would have the safest way to health.” – Hippocrates India is the second-most populous country on the earth and is home to more than 400 million children, who account for 37 percent of the entire population of the world. Unfortunately, India is no exception to the global struggle to feed its younger generations a nutrient-dense diet. Around 73 percent of all Indian diets are protein-deficient, and the shortfall is even more alarming among vegetarians (IMRB survey, 2017). The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommends a daily intake of 200–300 grams of milk for children, and many states are still striving to achieve this goal. India is a leading producer of milk, but, in many regions, elevated agricultural performance does not necessarily equate to an improved diet. As part of its commitment to serve people and to improve the nutritional status of children, Alltech initiated its Nutri Milk Project in November 2017, partnering with the Thribhuvandas Foundation in Anand, Gujarat, to supply milk to young students in the region. “It is an absolute honor to be associated with Thribhuvandas Foundation in this project,” said Dr. Aman Sayed, managing director of Alltech India and regional director of Alltech South Asia. “As a nutrition company, we feel it is our responsibility to provide practical and proven solutions to enhance the nutrition level of children, who are tomorrow’s future.” Alltech initiated the project in Gujarat, a mostly vegetarian state where milk is the main source of animal protein. Milk, a whole food that provides many essential nutrients, is a crucial part of the diet of growing children in this region. In the selected schools, 98.5 percent of school children can be categorized as undernourished on the body mass index (BMI) scale. Five schools in the Tarapur cluster were selected for the program, as children in this region were noted to be especially malnourished. Alltech began providing 150 ml each of flavored, fortified milk every day to around 1,200 children, aged 5 to 13, as well as a weekly supplement of iron. The sole aim of this is to improve the nutritional status of these children — and, by doing so, to build a healthier India. On its journey to nourish the children of Tarapur, Alltech has delivered 1,78,754 milk pouches in the project’s first year alone. Along with a 5.45-percent average improvement in the BMI of their students, the schools involved in this program have also experienced a considerable increase in attendance. These results inspired Alltech to expand the project, and in 2018, six more schools were added. Alltech plans to expand the program even further. “Childhood is a critical time in the growth and development of a person and is a key stage in the establishment of their physical and mental abilities,” said Sayed. “We are proud to see the positive impact Alltech is having on the lives of children in the program. These children are benefiting daily from Nutri Milk, not just by improving their nutrition but by increasing their attendance and education, and this is a proud moment for Alltech.” Alltech is committed to improving the health and performance of people, animals and plants around the world through natural nutrition and scientific innovation. At a global level, Alltech works extensively with local schools to build science labs and encourages students to pursue science with a greater curiosity about the world around them.

Considering the power of social media, prosumers have become vocal advocates for products and brands, and what they choose to consume reflects their values, aspirations and beliefs. From a company perspective, it means that more and more prosumers shape, and even control, the message and drive demand — not the manufacturer. (Food producers & farmers must) expect to meet consumer demands, not just those they have defined today but those they think of tomorrow. - Walter Robb, CEO, Whole Foods, at the Alltech REBELation Conference, Lexington, KY. May 2015. Nowhere is this more evident than in the changing world of food production. Food is becoming incredibly cheap, representing less than 10 percent of the household expenditure in the Western world. For the first time perhaps in history, the biggest challenges facing the food chain involve not just production technologies or costs, but the environmental and social impact of both production processes and the food itself. Sales of processed foods are dropping as consumers turn to products with ‘clean labels’ (ingredients that you would find in a home kitchen) and organic foods. Sales of carbonated soda drinks, potato chips, packaged cereals, frozen dinners, chewing gum and even orange juice have dropped by as much as 25 percent in the last five years as consumers come to see these as unhealthy food choices. By contrast, the growth in craft beers and craft breads, artisanal cheeses, coffee shops and organic stores reflect the intersection of craft and mass marketing. At the same time, recognizing these changes, government regulators, non-governmental organizations, suppliers of goods and services, and even potential employees are more proactive and outspoken than ever. Welcome to the era of the prosumer. Consumers who can easily research ingredients, processes and companies to make more informed decisions regarding food safety and nutrition are driving the pace and imperative for change in the food industry.

For some, this will only require a little more paperwork; for others, a whole new business plan will be required. A healthy start for calves begins with colostrum With producers looking for ways to operate within the new law, the answer may be found in a fresh look at their management practices, beginning with calving. The first day of a calf’s life, especially the first few hours, is critical to its health and survival, setting the stage for lifetime performance. The most crucial time is shortly after birth when the calf receives colostrum, which is naturally high in the nutrients necessary to increase the calf’s metabolism and stimulate the digestive system. Most importantly, it is the only source of immunoglobulins (IgG), or antibodies, which provide the passive immune protection essential for keeping the calf healthy. Antibodies are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract during the first 24 hours of life and provide the basis of the calf’s immune system for the first three to six months of age. Not only does colostrum provide the necessary antibodies needed for survival, but it provides a source of fats, proteins, vitamins and minerals. Ensuring passive transfer of antibodies in colostrum feeding Colostrum feeding is the most important practice for getting the calf off to the right start. However, just because a calf receives the amount needed at the desired time does not guarantee the calf will remain healthy. A study by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS) showed that almost 20 percent of dairy calf heifers had failure of passive transfer, or a concentration of IgG in the serum less than 10 grams per liter (2007). When the topic of colostrum quality comes up in conversation, one can hear “No, I do not test my colostrum, I can tell by physical appearance” or “I do not have issues with my calves, so the quality must be good.” However, there are many factors that affect colostrum quality that cannot be seen by observation only. It is recommended that a calf receive at least 100 grams of IgG, ideally 150 grams, from a minimum of 4 quarts of colostrum to help ensure passive transfer (USDA, NAHMS, 2007). Factors affecting colostrum quality What defines “good” quality colostrum? Research suggests that the concentration of IgG in the colostrum should be at least 50 grams per liter, with many factors affecting that level (USDA, NAHMS, 2007). There are other factors that contribute to and affect colostrum quality that are imperative to consider in your calves’ first feedings: Breed plays a big role in affecting the concentration level of IgG. Jerseys average 66 grams per liter of IgG compared to Holsteins at 48 grams per liter (BAMN, 2001). As a cow produces more colostrum, we tend to see dilution affecting the concentration level of IgG. Production of more than 18 pounds of colostrum at first milking (BAMN, 2001). Again, the tendency is to see a reduction in quality due to dilution of antibodies. The age of the cow. Typically, the younger the cow, the less quality colostrum she produces. Younger animals have not been exposed to pathogens as the older animals have. Therefore, the concentration of antibodies in the colostrum is much lower compared to older animals. The exposure a cow has to pathogens, whether young or old, varies from operation to operation. Each operation deals with its own issues when it comes to diseases. This is why a sound vaccination protocol needs to be in place not only to help promote animal health, but also to aide in producing good quality colostrum that has the needed antibodies for the calf to fight disease. The management of the cow during the dry period. A minimum of a three- to four-week dry period is needed to help ensure antibodies in the blood stream eventually concentrate in the colostrum. Along with length of dry period, nutrition can have an effect. If a dry cow is deficient in protein and energy, there will be a decrease in quality compared to cows with adequate nutrition. Cows that have colostrum removed by milking or leaking before calving will produce poor quality colostrum due to the removal of antibodies and the dilution of what colostrum is left. Colostrum that has a low concentration of bacterial contaminants (<100,000 cfu/ml total bacteria count, <10,000 cfu/ml coliform count) (Godden, 2008). To keep counts low, be sure proper handling of colostrum after milking is practiced to ensure a clean product. Seasons that impact the cow, causing cold stress or heat stress and affecting forage quality. Stress from environmental temperature not only has a direct effect on the cow, but also affects the quality of forages that are fed. Tools for quality colostrum To help ensure a good quality colostrum, it is beneficial to get into the habit of using either a colostrometer or Brix refractometer. The colostrometer measures specific gravity using a color coded scale that converts the measurement to determine the concentration of IgG. Lately, the use of a Brix refractometer has shown to be useful in testing colostrum. Normally used to measure the amount of sucrose in a solution, the Brix refractometer can use the values to determine IgG levels in colostrum. There are many ways to help improve the quality of colostrum that is fed to newborn calves. Ensuring that colostrum quality is high improves calf mortality and morbidity rates and provides additional insurance when producers are faced with reduced use of antibiotics. ¹Bovine Alliance on Management and Nutrition.

The area faces several challenges due to weather, soil quality and pests, such as the boll weevil. Nutritional management during plant development is therefore essential in aiding the grower to obtain good results at harvest. In Mato Grosso, growers who are using amino acid-based solutions are already seeing healthier cotton crops that are expected to result in yield increases. Cotton is a very demanding crop, requiring careful management throughout the growing cycle in order to ensure boll set, which directly reflects productivity potential. Poor soil and nutrient deficiencies can quickly affect yield potential if not corrected. Benefits of amino acid technology for crops, such as cotton “Amino acids facilitate the uptake of micronutrients such as boron and manganese, resulting in improved development, nutrition and fill,” explains Brazilian cotton consultant Thiago Ferreira Gomes. Gomes notes that the nature of amino acids allows for easier nutrient absorption by the cotton plant without an increase in stress. Similar challenges to those facing Mato Grosso can be found in Texas and Georgia as well as other cotton-growing areas of North America, where successful yields are also being reached through proper management and nutrition. “Using amino acid technology reduces environmental stress and increases plant health, which can result in increased yields and profitability,” says Carly Borel, Alltech Crop Science business development manager. Recent wheat research at the University of Kentucky also demonstrated the benefits of amino acid technology.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/amino-acid-technology-contributes-cotton-yield-increase","title":"\n\n                    Amino acid technology contributes to cotton yield increase \n                    ","date":"January 12, 2017","contentLength":275}},{"pageContent":"Combatting stressors in coffee production In many homes throughout the world, the day starts with a cup of coffee. Very likely, that cup originated in Brazil and, particularly, in Minas Gerais. Minas Gerais, the fourth-largest state in Brazil and second only to São Paulo in population, offers great diversity not only in geography, but in agriculture. Varying climates, soil types and elevations make it possible for the state to produce crops ranging from bananas and corn to potatoes and sugar cane, with coffee being the state’s number one crop. This variability in terrain also leads to adverse conditions for the coffee plant caused by temperature, nutritional deficiencies and higher relative humidity, which affect the final formation of the coffee. Proper plant nutrition can aid the plants in combating these stressors and reaching their production potential. Recently, Alltech Crop Science opened a new production facility in Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, which will not only increase opportunities for residents in the area, but will provide greater availability and quality of service for growers in the region. “The city is a prime example of logistic infrastructure for Brazil, so moving to this area (the Triângulo Mineiro) will benefit many of our customers,” said Ney Ibrahim, director of Alltech Crop Science in Brazil. Marcelo Vieira, a producer who grows approximately 500 acres of coffee, has been using the Alltech Crop Science solutions on his operation for several years and has seen greater uniformity and improvement in plant health. “Later, these positive aspects are reflected in the mature coffee and in the quality of the beverage and, of course, in our pockets,” affirmed Vieira.

We forget the important roles that amino acids have in our lives and in the lifecycle of the foods we eat. Amino acids are often referred to as the building blocks of proteins. These organic molecules link with one another to form long polypeptide chains, which, in turn, form the various proteins that are present in all living organisms. They are also the precursors of several substances that regulate plant metabolism, such as plant hormones, coenzymes and cell wall polymers, as well as others. In order to grow and develop, plants need to synthesize a continuous supply of protein-forming amino acids. Separated into L-amino acids and D-amino acids based on whether their spatial configuration bears to the left or right, only L-amino acids are found in biological activity. These types of amino acids participate in plant metabolism in different ways, from aiding in the metabolism of nitrogen to transporting minerals to various parts of the plants. Even after delivering their minerals, the amino acids themselves are useful to plants and are known to offset external stresses, including those associated with common herbicides and environmental factors. Amino acids can also serve as organic complexing agents, delivering micronutrients in a highly bioavailable, environmentally friendly form. Minerals complexed with amino acids can bypass the leaf’s surface and be rapidly absorbed. These molecules remain intact as they travel through the leaf barrier with minimal interference. From there, they may either be absorbed and used by the leaf cells or travel on to the phloem, typically to new leaves, flowers, fruit and other fast-growing parts of the plant.

Now you can only see one. You can’t tell him that things haven’t changed. Since graduating from the University of Kentucky and beginning his own farming career in Loretto, Kentucky, Hupman has seen 41 years of crops. In that time, the years have been filled with successes and failures, both of which have taught him invaluable lessons and paved the way for experimentation on his fields. Hupman takes an objective approach to his crop maintenance. “Basically, I try something and see if it works,” he said. “I’ll put it to the test, and I don’t know that I can be any fairer than that.” Using strip trials, soil sampling and yield monitoring, he is able to get a clear picture of how effective a treatment is on his fields. A move to no-till farming The norm when Hupman began farming was to use a long-term crop rotation, in which a grower would plant crops for two years followed by two to four years of using the same field for pasture or hay before returning to crops and continuing the cycle. Advancements in fertilizers and pesticides made it possible to crop annually on the same fields. In 1983, Hupman went no-till. Improving soil conditions with a more natural farming approach “If you work the soil, you destroy the biology, you destroy everything, and that’s the whole secret to soil: that biology,” he said. In the first few years, Hupman put an emphasis on fertilizers to get his soil back in order and to build up the micronutrient levels. Searching for ways to improve his soil biology has led Hupman to look for more natural options in his crop inputs. “I would much rather put a natural type of product on the soil or crop than pesticides,” he said. “We’ve got to put more work into natural products and natural ways of controlling things. Eventually, all these pesticides are going to catch up with us.” Since taking this more natural farming approach, Hupman has found that he has needed to use less fungicide and herbicide. Through the years, Hupman has also used various types of cover crops to help reestablish the soil biology. Currently, he has switched from a purely ryegrass cover crop to a mixture of several winter crops, including winter peas and buckwheat. When asked if he had any advice for the future generations of growers, Hupman offered these simple yet poignant words: “If we’re going to have a sustainable agriculture in this country, we need to protect and rebuild our soils.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/grower-spotlight-george-hupman","title":"\n\n                    Grower spotlight: George Hupman\n                    ","date":"January 12, 2017","contentLength":467}},{"pageContent":"During ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference, attendees at the International Welcome Dinner were greeted by a VIP guest, a 6-ton Keenan mixer wagon, also known as the “Green Machine.” After the recent Alltech acquisition of Keenan, Dr. Pearse Lyons, founder and president of Alltech, wanted to share the story of Keenan and show people what this mixer has to offer. The Keenan mixer wagon is the brainchild of Richard Keenan. Having first seen a total mixed ration (TMR) mixer wagon in the U.S., he wanted to make a real difference for farmers. He brought the idea to Ireland in 1978 and began improving upon it, tailoring it to suit the Irish animal diet. He went on to develop a system that was suitable for Northern Europe. The first Keenan mixer wagon was built in 1983; there are now machines in more than 35 countries across the globe. The secret to the wagon’s success is the technology behind it. No matter what feed and forages you use, there are two things that are crucial: the quality and the consistency of the mix. Independent research shows the mix needs to be the same, day in and day out, to deliver the best results. That means evenly, thoroughly mixed feed that is never over- or under-mixed, with ingredients that are consistently added in the same order and ratios. The wagon does all this and more. It breaks down the mix to produce fibers with clean-cut ends, which help provide an optimum rumen condition when digested by the animal. This “optimal physical mix” allows for greater absorption of energy and nutrients. François Derot, general manager of Keenan in France, discussed how farmers using the mixer wagon have seen an improvement in feed efficiency at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference. “What makes this machine special is that it creates a unique mix, which is made by retaining fiber structure to ensure optimum feed efficiency,” said Derot. “Thanks to its gentle mixing action, the mix is left light and fluffy. The technology behind the mix is where nutrition comes into play.” But there’s more to the Green Machine than meets the eye. PACE Connect, a small box that sits on the Keenan mixer wagon, provides farmers with guidance on the order of loading and mixing and the number of paddle revolutions to achieve this optimal physical mix. This technology draws on Keenan’s ingredient database, which separates feed types into eight different categories. This small box provides the farmer with the correct loading sequence and the paddle revolutions needed. The PACE Connect database currently holds details on over 10 million categorized ingredients drawn from over 1,700 farms in a wide range of countries. This technology utilizes the mobile phone network to connect the mixer wagon to a secure site that can be accessed by authorized users from anywhere in the world on any web-enabled device. This information can then be accessed by Keenan nutritionists, who can offer live support through their InTouch technology. Here, a live review service ensures the herd gets exactly what it needs every day. The nutritionists provide constant advice on how to improve the TMR to enhance the performance of the herd. This allows farmers to manage herd health, ration formulation, weight gain and yield. Between Alltech’s primacy in science and Keenan’s manufacturing strength and technological know-how, Alltech has a winning combination to deliver greater farm efficiency and profitability directly to its farming customers.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/technology-advances-agriculture-industry-keenan-green-machine","title":"\n\n                    Technology advances in the agriculture industry: The Keenan Green Machine\n                    ","date":"March 7, 2018","contentLength":584}},{"pageContent":"Traditionally, mineral supplementation has been achieved through the use of inorganic minerals. However, developing technologies have ushered in a new era in mineral nutrition. The newest edition of the “Brazilian Tables for Poultry and Swine” verifies the efficiency of organic mineral supplementation in monogastric animals, with farmers starting to implement organic mineral nutrition and seeing improvements in efficiency and gains in performance. Today, we know that feeding the right form of mineral is key to optimizing herd performance, health and productivity. Studies show that organic trace minerals (OTM): Offer higher bioavailability than inorganic minerals (Close 2006). Have high biological activity (Peters and Mahan 2004, 2014). Reduce concerns about negative mineral interactions (Peters et al. 2014) Piglet quality starts with the sow Switching mineral forms can have a significant impact on your sow productivity and your overall pig production. Sows transfer a significant amount of minerals to the fetus during pregnancy (Mahan et al. 2009), meaning that the gestation and lactation periods are crucial times in the sow’s productivity and in her piglets’ viability. A study published in the Brazilian Journal of Animal Science found that sows given the organic form of trace minerals produced piglets with increased weight at birth and, after 21 days, higher iron content in the liver and blood. “By supplying Bioplex® trace minerals, we are providing the sow with minerals that are better absorbed, which in turn makes the sow more productive, and more minerals are passed on to her offspring,” says Russell Gilliam, Alltech’s U.S. swine business manager. “The end result is that we are able to lower income cost in producing a weaned pig.” A “more with less” approach Alltech’s innovative Total Replacement Technology™ was developed in response to modern production and the mineral requirements that are now demanded by your herd. Alltech has proven that modern management of mineral nutrition can be carried out by the inclusion of organic trace minerals in the form of Bioplex® and Sel-Plex® at significantly lower levels than inorganic trace minerals while still improving performance. Now more than ever, efficiency is a primary focus in the pig industry. Improper mineral supply can have major consequences for health and productivity and, as a result, come at a high cost.

At long last, riding season has arrived! Sadly, this also means the return of the horses’ constant and most pesky companion: the fly. And, while flies may seem like nothing more than an ever-present annoyance, they can carry serious implications for your equine counterparts. Flies are well-known for spreading disease, feeding off of the equine blood supply and causing potential digestive upset. And, unfortunately, even the most encompassing of fly turnouts — think fly mask with ears, fly sheet with belly guard and fly leggings, essentially making your horse resemble some strangely armored creature — can’t keep them completely at bay. More than a simple pest House flies may seem like the least of a horse owner’s worries, but they can carry disease and transmit parasites. They can also irritate a horse’s eyes, where they feed off of moist secretions. These flies breed during the summer and feed on muck, so proper stable management is imperative to reducing their numbers. Horse and deer flies are known for being ruthless biters. Thankfully, they are only active during the day. And, as luck would have it, these flies do not normally enter structures. It is best to have barn or stable access available for pasture horses if you notice these flies becoming particularly bothersome. Stable flies are probably the biggest equine nuisance of all. They live in barns and breed in organic, fermenting matter, such as manure, decaying straw or spilled, moist feed. They typically feed on horses’ legs and flanks and can cause significant blood loss, transmit swamp fever and cause summer sores — weeping wounds that are challenging to heal. Horses may also stomp incessantly in an attempt to rid themselves of these pests, only to cause hoof and leg issues. Shoo, fly: Sanitation and stable management tips It should come as no surprise that proper sanitation and stable management are among the best methods of fly control. House flies and barn flies require breeding material, ideal moisture and adequate warmth to develop. Therefore, elimination of breeding sites is the key to a successful fly control program. Barns and paddocks should be thoroughly cleaned once per week to assist in breaking fly life cycles. Insecticides should only be considered as a supplement to fly control. Below are some tips to help with your fly management program: Keep manure picked up and pile at a good distance from facilities, waterers and paddocks. Make sure all garbage cans have tight-fitting lids and are cleaned out regularly. Keep waterers in good condition and place them away from areas where horses are fed. Consider screening windows in feed and tack rooms, as well as box stalls. Fans that direct a downward and outward airflow will help to keep flies from entering barns. Fly traps and sticky paper are an effective way to capture flies. They may also be useful in documenting fly numbers over time. A notable increase in catch from one week to the next could be a warning to check on sanitation measures and increase your fly control measures. Last, but not least, keep this in mind: Large numbers of flies mean there are a great deal of breeding sites in your area. There are many insecticide options (e.g., residuals, sprays, fogs, mists, etc.), but they will only provide temporary relief and should generally be used sparingly. Your best option is to keep a tidy stable and yard — both you and your horses will be grateful for the extra effort! Looking to add fly control to your horse’s nutrition program?

Producers know all too well, however, the variables inherent in farming that are at odds with standardization of the final product. During the growth cycle, the flower setting and fruit standardization stages are essential to meet the desired aspects of color, size and flavor. These periods, which determine productivity and fruit classification, can be a challenge for producers since the plants are constantly subjected to stressors, such as adverse environmental conditions, which can compromise crop development. An ally in crop development: Hormonal precursors According to agronomist Marcos Revoredo, technical manager for Alltech Crop Science in Brazil who specializes in intensive crops, hormonal precursors may be an ally in minimizing the physiological stress on the plants. “By applying these precursors as a substitute to a pre-mixed combination of hormones, it is possible to stimulate the plant to produce its own hormonal balance in the precise quantities needed to meet the plant’s demands at that exact moment,” he explains. In response to this natural hormonal balance, “the plant will have a better redistribution of nutrients to flowers and fruits, increasing production. It also allows for more balanced plant growth and, in the following stages of fruit development, increases standardization of size,” says Revoredo. Profitability through uniformity In Araguari, Minas Gerais, Brazil, producer Edson Trebeschi emphasizes the importance of care in the standardization of the size of the tomatoes. “If you have a fruit that is higher in quality and uniform in size, it results in greater profitability down the road,” says Trebeschi. For this reason, Trebeschi has been increasing his implementation of more sustainable production practices, working preventively to improve plant resistance. Additional considerations for top tomato crops Revoredo also notes that besides the use of natural solutions based on hormonal precursors, such as plant extracts, minerals and amino acids that promote the reduction of the effects of stressors and improve the vigor of the plants, important factors in reaching good results in tomato crops include soil preparation, disease and pest management, adequate irrigation and nutritional maintenance.

Mortality, feed efficiency, growth and health costs are just a few of the many areas influenced by achieving optimal health. Positive gut health can have long-lasting effects on animal performance, herd health and producer returns. In this webinar, Dr. Stewart Galloway, senior swine nutritionist at Hubbard Feeds, discussed the lifetime impacts of gut health strategies implemented early in the life of the pig. According to Galloway, gut health is a critical success factor that affects things such as pig value — as a source of profit and as a source of protein globally — sow productivity, animal welfare and the responsible use of antibiotics. Gut health is essential for building a foundation for performance and profitability in pig production. Healthy pigs will eat and produce more efficiently, ensuring they are performing at their maximum potential. What is the ideal gut? The goal is to help generate a fully developed gastrointestinal system in which water, pH and beneficial bacteria are balanced and maintained while pathogens and toxins are kept out. So, how you can tell if a pig’s gut is healthy? To start, observe pig activity. Are the pigs alert and moving around? Are they eating? Are they displaying normal behavior? Another indicator is diarrhea. Diarrhea is a telltale sign that something is not right with the pig’s gut, so it is important to keep an eye out for pigs that have this symptom. Other indicators of a healthy gut include lower morbidity and fewer treated pigs as well as growth and feed efficiency. However, it is important to remember that many factors can disrupt good gut health. For example, weaning is the biggest stressor put on a pig. Poor gut health strategies implemented at this stage of life will negatively impact the pig throughout its lifecycle. Dietary changes, pathogens and mixing, and crowding stress are some of the other factors that negatively affect gut integrity. Tips for good gut health Galloway suggests a comprehensive program approach by implementing these three strategies for good gut health: Decrease gut inflammation Decrease pathogens Decrease water loss When a gut is inflamed, several problems arise: nutrients are not properly absorbed; there is an increase in antigens, leading to further inflammation; pathogens and toxins move right through the cells, causing inflammation inside the cell; and there is water loss and water movement out of the cells into the gut, leading to dehydration and diarrhea. To combat inflammation and in turn decrease pathogens and water loss, producers should do a few critical things. First, identify the pig’s stressors and decrease stress. Second, optimize ingredient selection and combination, such as proteins and amino acids, as well as the use of carbohydrates. Third, use enzymes to draw more nutrients from the feed, making them more available for absorption by the pig for its own use and less available for the pathogens to use as a food source later on in the gut. Achieving and maintaining a healthy gut is a continuous process and requires a complete approach to gut health, not just a one-time or quick fix. An animal truly never gets over a good or bad start. Make gut health a priority and get your pigs on track for lifelong success.

And, while there are many advocates who are clearly pro- or anti-GMO, both sides seem to be fighting for the same worthwhile goals — safe, abundant food for all, fewer toxic chemicals used on farms globally and a more sustainable food system. On the closing night of ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference 2018 (ONE18), attendees were invited to gather at the historic Kentucky Theater for a private showing of the 2016 documentary “Food Evolution.” The Institute of Food Technologists funded the film in an effort to inspire discussion and debate about the food-related challenges that we face globally, the instrumental role that science will play in addressing these issues and public perception surrounding the science of food. At the film’s conclusion, a panel discussion with two of our ONE18 speakers — Crystal Mackay, president of the Canadian Centre for Food Integrity, and Jack Bobo, senior vice president and chief communications officer at Intrexon — was led by Irish broadcaster Damien O’Reilly from RTÉ Radio 1. Focused on food and future The panel and audience had many valuable insights on both sides of the debate. Jack Bobo spent 13 years working in global food policy at the U.S. Department of State and spent three years working with the producers of the film. “I actually told them not to do a film about GMOs because it’s too provocative,” he said. Bobo strongly feels that values trump science when it comes to issues like this. In fact, he said, he “never once met someone that was anti-science. Stop telling people what you do and tell them why you do it. The science won’t matter to most people.” MacKay said we need to change the conversation to instead discuss our common goals. “This technology [in particular] has been thrown under the bus due to a myriad of other issues — anti-corporate, anti-greed, etc., so how do we communicate about a complicated truth over simple lies?” she asked. Bobo then remarked, “Every regulatory industry in the world has concluded that GMOs aren’t harmful.” He believes topics like this have more to do with tribalism than anything else. “[Our friends] feel a certain way about something, and we want to be a part of their crowd more than we want to worry about [scientific fact],” he said. In the same vein, when was the last time we changed our minds about something? Anything is possible. Bobo even admitted that he first felt production agriculture was the only solution until he learned more about organic farming and what it brings to the table in terms of addressing food system challenges. It would seem that a combination of both practices may be warranted. As an audience member wisely pointed out, “Is the real issue here not so much whether the science is right or wrong, but instead communication?” Our panelists agreed that more transparency would be helpful but that the issue remains complex. One thing is certain: We were all given a great deal of food for thought as we consider how we might move forward in feeding a hungry world.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/food-evolution-and-great-gmo-debate","title":"\n\n                    “Food Evolution” and the great GMO debate\n                    ","date":"May 23, 2018","contentLength":555}},{"pageContent":"The Haitian cities of Ouanaminthe and Dondon have turned coffee production into an opportunity to establish a sustainable economy. Since 2010, the Sustainable Haiti Project — developed by these communities in collaboration with Alltech — has helped bolster urban infrastructure, decreased the school dropout rate and has generally improved the quality of life for this region’s citizens. Product export revenues from the Sustainable Haiti Project have, thus far, benefited 600 families in Dondon and helped enroll 800 children in two newly built schools. This initiative was the brainchild of the late Alltech founder Dr. Pearse Lyons, who, following the earthquake that devastated the island nation in 2010, traveled to Haiti to help. During his visit, the Irish businessman realized that the capital city of Port-au-Prince was already home to many businesses and organizations — leading him to focus his efforts on other areas of the country. “Upon arriving in Dondon, he perceived the potential of the region,” said project coordinator Avelyne St. Hilaire. “He wanted to do a long-term project that could help people. The idea was to strengthen communities that are remote from Port-au-Prince in a sustainable way, so that children do not need to move to have a better future.” The Sustainable Haiti Project helped improve the condition of the roads that led to local schools, which had previously been difficult to access, contributing to a high rate of dropout. “Before, the children did not have the opportunity to study, because parents could not leave them in the schools,” St. Hilaire continued. “Today, they manage to go to their jobs and know that their children will be studying and receiving support.” In addition to these efforts to enhance quality of life, the Sustainable Haiti Project also promotes sustainable coffee production. Coffee has historically been Haiti's main export, and, with Alltech’s support, producers in Dondon and Ouanaminthe have achieved higher crop yields — without damaging the environment. “We have done our best to set up new planting practices, thinking about the quality of light and shade for grains and looking to control diseases in a natural way,” said Cedieu Joseph, president of the cooperative. “Today, we have a biological coffee, which benefits our exports.” The coffee produced in Dondon is recognized as high-quality and stands out as Haiti’s only organic coffee product. Sitting at more than 243 meters above sea level, the geographic location of the local coffee production makes the grains softer and gives the beans a differentiated, unique flavor. But thanks to the efforts of the Sustainable Haiti Project, this coffee is special for more than its flavor profile. \"When people consume Café Citadelle, they are not only consuming a simple coffee,” said St. Hilaire. “They are helping people and changing their reality.” Click here for more information on Alltech's philanthropic efforts.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/sustainable-haiti-project-changes-economic-lives-many","title":"\n\n                    Sustainable Haiti Project changes the economic lives of many\n                    ","date":"March 14, 2019","contentLength":472}},{"pageContent":"An interview with Dr. Karl Dawson The following is an edited transcript of our interview with Dr. Karl Dawson, vice president and chief scientific officer at Alltech.

We talk about molecular biology and the things we can see with molecular biology; most farmers I talk to, most siblings from farmer’s kids that are coming off the farm, do not have a good understanding of what those things are, so we have this gap that we need to fill. What we’re finding is that often times just the university education is not enough to give them confidence and the ability to lead in agriculture through using these technologies. One of the things we are doing right now is looking at a lot of outside programs that go beyond their degree and beyond academic training to see how we can interest students in doing those things. It starts at a very young level. We have programs that are set up at the elementary school. On our staff in research, we have two liaisons that do nothing but interact with college, high school and elementary students to get them interested in what we’re doing in terms of science and how that can be incorporated into farm life. Other programs that are very interesting are those that are competitive. We have an innovation program, where we have students build projects that will become a business plan themselves, taking technology and applying it to specific problems. It’s an outside-of-the-classroom activity that gets students excited. There is nothing like seeing them light up when they win an award for a project. We have, at a higher level up, a career program. This is built around the idea that students who come out of college need that little extra boost and piece of information. We actually take students and embed them into the business situation and, in some cases, right on the farm so they get to know the animals and what the farm business really looks like. This is before they go out and try to set up their own business or work within a commercial business. The take-home message is that we really need to give experience, hands-on experience outside of the classroom. That’s really becoming almost a requirement for our people as they move into our business. That certainly makes sense. As a professor, and on the Alltech side as the head of our research program, are the up-and-comers that you’re seeing from an agriculture background, or do they come into agriculture by chance because of other things they are interested in? You run into both kinds. I came up through the agricultural school system, so I’m used to land-grant universities and the kids that came from the farm. But I actually looked at the list of students that were competing in our Young Scientist awards, and I asked them: How many of you are from an agriculture background? Of the 15 sitting in the room, only two raised their hands. You know, the kids are gravitating to agriculture because they see some of the applications that can take place. It’s almost reverse of what we think. We think about children leaving the farm and never coming back. These are students coming in from urban environments, from science environments, and wanting to understand what’s going on on the farm. That’s encouraging and fascinating. It really is. You think about that and it really reflects the excitement of agriculture research and application technology. I kind of coined a term I’m going to use in my presentation here talking about the “farmer technologist”; that is the kind of people who will probably be our leaders in the future.

In a profession where practical solutions and “toughing it out” are seen as the principal ways to face difficulties, very few seek professional psychological support although studies have indicated farming has one of the highest suicide rates of any occupation. The statistics are staggering. One farmer ends their life every two days in France. In India, one farmer commits suicide every 30 minutes. In 2014, Newsweek called the issue an international crisis. When it comes to mental health in the agriculture sector, no continent is spared. Crushing debts, low yields, health issues, loneliness, environmental catastrophes, falling prices of agricultural commodities, shifting land rights, national laws, supranational policies and lack of employment benefits are among the many contributors to depression in farming. Farmers face incredible pressure in their daily tasks in addition to the long work hours they put in. It’s a 365-day job with very little rest. Additionally, a single event that can seem insignificant for the rest of the population, such as a warmer summer or a few cents increase in commodity prices, can have dramatic repercussions for farmers’ livelihoods. Due to the nature of their occupation, farmers do not have access to the internal psychological support some companies would provide through a human resources department. They must find support elsewhere, either through their peers or by consulting a medical professional. Some studies have shown that the latter is rarely done by farmers, not only because some feel reluctant to seek outside help, but also because it remains a costly and often unavailable service due to remoteness or lack of specialists. The challenges lead some farmers to abandon their family farms and a life’s worth of hard work, while others might find a refuge in alcohol, and unfortunately, the difficulties seem so insurmountable to some that ending one’s life feels like the only option. What can we do to reduce distress in the farming profession? In a world where the number of farmers is decreasing while global population is soaring, let’s remember that farmers play a critical role in our very sustenance. More than ever, we need to support them in their endeavors. Through education and awareness programs, we can encourage farmers to seek professional help in times of distress and make counseling a refuge. Specialized associations have been created to offer psychological support to farmers and help them overcome their daily difficulties, but these initiatives remain largely underdeveloped, especially in some regions of the world. The first step, arguably, is in taking away the stigma of acknowledging the need for support for oneself, friends or family. Be aware of your own mental health, and take note of changes in family, friends, employees or neighbors. Then, reach out to a support network, many of which can offer confidential counseling services and some of which are specific to the unique needs of the agricultural community. What can you do? If you are suffering, please do not bear the burden in silence. Share your concerns with someone you trust or contact the resources below. If someone you know is struggling, be there to support them and share resources like those below that can offer professional assistance. Lastly, all of us can do a better job of supporting farmers, ranchers and producers, the very source of our sustenance. We can do this as agvocates on social media, in conversations with friends and family, and in our political systems.

Since then, many questions have been top of mind for producers and feed suppliers: Do I need a VFD for my feed? Is there anything I need to change? How do I get prepared for the new regulations? Dr. Chris Rademacher, senior clinician at Iowa State University, explored these questions and more in the webinar “The VFD.

This got me thinking: while the livestock world is generally well-versed in mycotoxin management strategies, the equine world is likely less familiar with mycotoxins overall. As the name suggests, mycotoxins are toxic compounds, produced in nature by certain types of mold and fungi. More than 500 types of mycotoxins have been identified to date, and multiple varieties are commonly found in animal feedstuffs, especially when environmental conditions prove favorable; warmer temperatures and higher moisture levels are often key contributors. Horses may be exposed to mycotoxins through the consumption of infected pasture grasses, moldy forages or contaminated grains; even bedding can be impacted. While you may be able to see the molds that produce mycotoxins on contaminated feedstuffs, mycotoxins themselves are not visible to the naked eye, making them even more difficult to destroy. So, what can you do? Aflatoxicosis: Signs and symptoms I should first clarify that it is almost impossible to find pasture, hay, grain or bedding that is completely mold- and mycotoxin-free. Although harmful levels of mycotoxins are generally rare, elevated levels — especially of certain types of mycotoxins — are a serious cause for concern. Aflatoxicosis, which is defined as poisoning caused by the consumption of substances or foods contaminated with aflatoxin, is typically produced by a type of mold called Aspergillus flavus. This naturally occurring fungus thrives in the humid conditions we’ve experienced over the past year. According to petMD, making a definitive diagnosis of aflatoxicosis is often difficult because the clinical signs can be non-specific and mimic several other serious conditions. Aflatoxin poisoning may be associated with any of the following: Depression Elevated temperature Yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice) Significant weight loss Abdominal pain (colic) Bloody feces Brown urine Recurrent airway obstruction (heaves) Ataxia (loss of coordination) Muscle spasms and/or seizures Death While blood work may show raised levels of enzymes in the liver, among other fluctuations, samples from a living animal cannot conclusively diagnose the ingestion of aflatoxin. Instead, sampling the contaminated feed is recommended, although collecting a representative feed sample can prove challenging. Treatment and prevention If you suspect that your horse has ingested harmful levels of aflatoxin or any other mycotoxin, act immediately. You may choose to orally administer activated charcoal, which can absorb toxins and, as a result, help prevent them from being absorbed by your horse’s body. You must also remove any potentially contaminated feed sources. Prevention is, of course, the best plan of action. Following the tips included below could help diminish your horses’ risk of exposure to potentially dangerous mycotoxins: Keep feed storage areas clean, cool, dry and free of pests, which can chew holes in bagged feed, thereby exposing it to the elements. When it comes to both hay and grain, feed old to new. Recognize when hay may be beyond appropriate fodder for horses and pay attention to the shelf life of grain — particularly if oil, molasses or other liquids have been added. If you dump feed into storage bins or cans, it is important to regularly empty them and clean out the feed that gets stuck in the cracks and crevices of your containers. Learn whether your feed manufacturer regularly tests their grain for mycotoxins — and avoid feeds from manufacturers who don’t. Do not feed corn directly. Always inspect your hay prior to feeding. Our horses are truly our partners in equestrian sport, and it’s our responsibility to act as stewards on their behalf. Taking a little more time to be vigilant in your feeding practices will be well worth it and should help to alleviate worries about the potentially life-threatening outcomes associated with mycotoxin contamination.

Technological innovations have the ability to transform every link in the food chain, from seed to fork. The need to embrace the opportunities these innovations offer is real. In order to feed the nearly 10 billion people with whom we will be sharing this planet by 2050, crop and livestock productivity improvements are essential. Agricultural efficiency is still relatively poor: 7 tons of feed are needed to produce just 1 ton of meat. It takes 880 gallons of water to produce one gallon of milk. Further, climate change is already requiring changes to crop management, and access to fresh water and good soil are becoming serious limitations for agriculture. Finally, there are competing food requirements. In wealthier areas, food is a relatively small part of the household budget, and consumers are becoming prosumers, with high expectations for the standard and types of food they want. At the same time, global hunger and food scarcity are serious challenges - nearly 800 million people are undernourished. Connecting both is the global food chain: ensuring that there is transparency, traceability and trust between producers, processors and prosumers. Digital disruption drives the next agricultural revolution Fortunately, the makings of a fifth agricultural revolution are here, with the potential to reduce or eliminate all of these issues. Eight emerging digital technologies each have the potential to transform agriculture. They range from specific technical tools to new ways of seeing the existing system. Some, especially the first ones, sound familiar but their use in agriculture is novel. These eight digital technologies can be categorized into four each of hardware and software and, when combined with the IoT (Internet of Things), can profoundly change the way food production works.

Some of the most commonly found equine parasites are large and small strongyles, roundworms, tapeworms, pinworms and bots. They can have debilitating effects, including, but not limited to, weight loss, diarrhea, anemia, coughing and liver damage. But there is hope. By establishing a regular, targeted deworming schedule designed to significantly decrease the numbers of these harmful pests, you can help your horse — and potentially other horses on the property — achieve better health. You may be wondering how you could possibly help other horses. Some horses have a higher immune status than others and may not be as susceptible to the harmful effects of parasites. These horses may be chronic shedders, meaning that while they might not exhibit clinical signs of parasitism, they could be carrying a lot of adult worms, which are producing eggs that are then inadvertently spread to the shedder’s pasture mates. You may need to deworm chronic shedders more often than others in an effort to keep everyone healthier. An effective deworming program needs to take several factors into consideration, including: Age: Foals and other young horses are more susceptible to certain types of parasites (large and small strongyles, roundworms, pinworms, tapeworms and potentially threadworms). Location: Different kinds of parasites are more common in different areas or climates. Season: Some parasites, like bot flies, are only active during specific times of the year. Travel: Horses that travel to shows may be exposed to infected horses and parasites they might not otherwise be exposed to at home. Pasture: Many horses grazing in a given area may increase parasite exposure. Other animals may also shed parasites that could infect your horse. The importance of fecal egg counts The best way to determine your horse’s specific deworming needs is to have your veterinarian perform a routine fecal examination, also known as a fecal egg count (FEC), during which the feces are inspected for the presence of worm eggs and the eggs are then counted. From there, you can work together to evaluate the numbers and types of parasites and decide on a course of action. If possible, I recommend having a second FEC performed 10 to 14 days after deworming. This is known as a “fecal egg count reduction test” and will tell you if deworming was effective. Resistance to commonly used dewormers is becoming more prevalent, so it’s important to make sure there are fewer eggs in your horse’s manure after deworming. Management tips You may also aid in keeping parasite numbers down with good management practices: Clean pastures regularly: Remove and dispose of manure at least twice weekly. Rotate pastures: Move horses between pastures to naturally break parasitic life cycles. Use elevated feeders: Lift grain and hay off the ground, where parasites thrive. Lastly, I should clarify that your horse will — unfortunately — never be 100 percent parasite-free. All horses will always carry some worms due to the cycle of pasture grazing and fecal contamination. However, with some precautionary steps and targeted treatment, you can help your horse build a better defense against these would-be internal invaders.

The first nishikigoi was produced by farmers breeding black carp (or Magoi) as a food source to survive severe winter weather conditions. The result of this effort was a vibrantly colored carp with an admirable figure that stood out from the rest with its rare beauty. As awareness grew, many started to appreciate nishikigoi like a fine work of art. The first koi was imported to the U.K. in 1980. This was the start of a new pet that has since become very popular throughout Western Europe. Admirers keep koi fish in their gardens (on average, 20-30 koi per pond), and they are often thought of as family members. Superfans keep and breed fish with beautiful and unique color patterns, which are often very valuable; individual fish can fetch prices of over US$11,000. Back to nature Not surprisingly, the feed market for these fish developed rapidly. High-quality nutrition, focused on growth, coloration and health of the fish, became increasingly important. High fishmeal and fish oil inclusion, synthetic colorants and uncommon herbs were used in an attempt to further improve koi feeds. However, as these koi feeds developed, one important fact was generally overlooked: koi DNA still closely resembles (by more than 99%) that of their ancestor, the common carp. And the common carp is a typical omnivorous fish — they spend much of their time stirring up mud and uprooting plants on the river bottom while also consuming insects, plant waste, water weeds and plankton. Keeping this close DNA match in mind, Alltech Coppens developed a new koi feed, specially designed for nishikigoi. The feed is called Midori, which translates to “green” in Japanese and refers to our back-to-nature concept that aims for both natural and sustainable koi feed. Key sustainable features of Midori: Contains insect meal derived from the black soldier fly Made with no fish meal or fish oil Formulated with algae, a natural and sustainable source of both EPA and DHA Designed with spirulina and other raw materials rich in natural colorants Unique shape of feed pellets mimics the size and shape of black soldier fly larvae, helping to promote the natural feeding behavior of koi and to give customers a unique fish-feeding experience I would like to learn more about aqua nutrition.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/swimming-art-bringing-koi-feed-back-nature","title":"\n\n                    Swimming art: Bringing koi feed back to nature\n                    ","date":"November 27, 2018","contentLength":409}},{"pageContent":"As a horse owner, there are few things more stressful than dealing with a hay shortage. Hearing the dreaded words, “I’m sorry, but I’m all out for the year,” can leave even the most prepared owner scrambling. Unfortunately, changing weather patterns have caused hay shortages to become increasingly more common throughout the U.S. Some areas have experienced sustained droughts, making it nearly impossible for crops to yield adequate supplies, while other areas have experienced several consecutive years of extremely wet spring and summer seasons, making it difficult for producers to cut hay in a timely manner. This has resulted in decreased supplies, lower-quality forages and record high prices. While some parts of the country are still producing ample supplies of high-quality hay, accessibility for those experiencing shortages can be limited by the challenge and expense of shipping. Things would be far less challenging if we could just increase concentrates to make up for the decreased amount of hay in our horses’ diets. While it may be tempting to do this when hay supplies are limited, we must keep in mind that horses require forage in their diets; removing it could have major health and behavioral consequences. A constant supply of fiber is required to keep the microbial populations in the horse’s intestinal tract happy, and limiting or removing forage can result in issues such as colic and gastric ulcers. In addition, limiting forage can result in increased occurrences of unwanted vices, such as wood-chewing. If possible, at least part of the fiber in the diet should come from long-stemmed forages, like hay or pasture grasses. Horses are grazing animals that have evolved to consume small amounts of forage throughout the day — and long-stemmed fiber provides them with much-needed “chew time.” Short-stemmed and processed fiber sources take less time to consume, which can lead to boredom and, in turn, the development of stereotypical vice behaviors. Research has shown, however, that horses can survive on a diet featuring only short-stemmed or processed forages as the source of fiber. As long as care is taken to decrease the horses’ boredom — which can be done by feeding multiple small meals, among other strategies — these alternative forage sources can be used to stretch your limited hay supply. What steps can you take if you are a horse owner facing a hay shortage? Get the most out of your hay supply. Purchasing higher-quality hay gives you an upper hand because it allows you to meet your animal’s nutritional requirements with less than what would be required if you were feeding a lower-quality hay. Feeding smaller, more frequent meals and using hay nets and feeders can greatly reduce the amount of hay that is wasted. Increase grazing. Depending on the availability and time of year, increase the time spent on pasture to allow for the increased consumption of fresh grass, which can help to reduce your hay burden. A rotational grazing strategy, along with a carefully organized pasture maintenance plan, can help thwart the detrimental effects increased grazing time can have on pasture quality. Consider purchasing bagged pelleted, cubed or chopped hay. These items can be purchased at many local feed supply stores, making them easily accessible alternative forage sources. They can be made from grass or legume hay, but the most common sources are timothy and alfalfa. Although they are more expensive than traditional baled hay, these alternatives are both dust- and mold-free, can be easily stored for long periods of time and often come with a minimum basic nutritional analysis on the bag. Pellets, which are formed from dried, ground hay, provide the nutrition and fiber of standard forage but do not provide the same bulk for gut fill as long-stemmed forages. Cubes are simply pressed chopped hay, but caution should be used when feeding cubes to horses that are prone to choke. For senior horses or those with dental issues, soaking pellets and cubes can make this source of forage somewhat easier to consume. Chopped hay — often called chaff — is simply hay that has been cut into short pieces prior to bagging. At one time, chaff was made primarily from straw that provided little nutritional value, but higher-quality grass and legume chaff is now commercially available. Haylage may help. Although they are not a popular feed choice in the U.S., ensiled forages can also be safely fed to horses, provided that some precautions are taken. Haylage should only be purchased from reputable sources, as incorrect preparation or storage can result in contamination by mold or botulism bacteria. Because of its unique taste and smell, it may take time for horses to get used to eating haylage. It is important to note that haylage can actually provide more nutrients than baled hay, as the ensiling process retains nutrients better than traditional hay curing. Extend your hay supply with a commercially available product. While beet pulp is not appropriate as the sole source of fiber in a horse’s diet, it is a good, palatable source of digestible fiber. It is also relatively inexpensive. Hay stretcher pellets and soy hulls are also good sources of fiber, and they, too, can be used as a partial replacement for hay — but, once again, they should not be used as the only source of fiber in the diet. In addition, many feed producers offer lines of complete feeds, and while these are often marketed for senior horses, they can be found and used for horses at all stages of life. When fed according to manufacturer guidelines, these complete feeds may be fed as the sole ration, requiring no additional forage source. Complete feeds often contain hay meal and are fortified to meet all of the nutritional needs of the horse. They also contain a higher amount of crude fiber than a standard commercial feed. No horse owner wants to face the headache of a hay shortage. Ensuring that your horses are receiving adequate nutrition during these times can be challenging no matter how well you have planned. Fortunately, several options exist that can help you stretch your hay supply and keep your horses happy and healthy through these stressful times.

Wildfires. Hurricanes. Floods. Droughts. Earthquakes. These powerful natural events can deliver massive destruction and loss of life. Often overlooked by the media and general public are the consequences for agriculture, and all who depend on farming for food and sustenance. Agricultural impacts from natural events and disasters most commonly include: • Contamination of water bodies. • Loss of harvest or livestock. • Increased susceptibility to disease. • Destruction of irrigation systems and other agricultural infrastructure. This article looks at many of the major natural disasters of 2017 and how these events have impacted farming, from the back-to-back powerful hurricanes that have wrecked crops in the Caribbean and the U.S. Gulf Coast and the wildfires that have decimated cattle ranches in the American West to a prolonged, devastating drought destroying crops in Portugal and Spain, and an earthquake in Latin America. The furies of wind and rain The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was extremely destructive and among the costliest on record. The August National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) forecast for an above-normal, hyperactive season featuring two to five major hurricanes turned out to be horribly understated. There were 10 of these ferocious storms during the season, and they all occurred one after another, the greatest number of consecutive hurricanes since satellites began tracking storms. Three in particular left trails of devastation from the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico to Florida and Texas: Harvey, Irma and Maria. Harvey At 10 p.m. CDT on Aug. 25, a storm of intense ferocity rolled over the Texas Gulf Coast near Corpus Christi. Hurricane Harvey arrived, delivered its first blow, bounced back out over the warm waters of the Gulf, regained strength and slammed Texas a second time. The weather analytics company WeatherBELL estimates that Harvey dumped 27 trillion gallons of rain over Texas and Louisiana during a six-day period. At 51 inches of rainfall, it was a record for the most ever from a tropical storm system in the continental U.S. Estimates by Moody’s Analytics put eventual total losses from Harvey alone at approximately $100 billion. Among the major casualties was what had been shaping up as one of the Texas cotton industry’s most promising years in recent times. “The cotton crop along the Gulf Coast was exceptional. It really was,” said Russell Boening, Texas Farm Bureau (TFB) president. “Yield-wise, this was going to be one of the best in 10 or 15 years.” That outlook disintegrated in only hours as Harvey roared inland, destroying at least $100 million in cotton, according to Texas A&M AgriLife Extension Service economists, and perhaps much more, by Boening’s estimate. The economists peg losses for Lone Star State livestock producers at $93 million, conservatively. “Livestock were lost and livestock were affected because they were standing in water so long,” said Boening. “They may have survived, but may have some health issues.” The Wendt Ranch in Bay City, Texas, after Harvey. Credit: The Wendt Ranch. Adding insult to injury, Harvey’s blow to Texas farmers arrived as grain producers were already dealing with trouble of another sort. “In Texas, we have really dramatically high levels of fumonisin,” noted Dr. Max Hawkins, nutritionist with the Alltech® Mycotoxin Management team. The increased presence of fumonisin was a result of hot weather in late June and July followed by a cool, exceptionally wet August. The fences, barns and animal-handling facilities destroyed in the storm must be rebuilt. And there are concerns about the replacement costs of hay that was destroyed in the high flood waters. “We are right on the verge of entering winter feeding season, and ranchers will have to find replacement hay that averages $63 per round bale,” said Dr. David Anderson, AgriLife Extension livestock economist in College Station, Texas. “A rancher may typically feed two or more round bales per cow during winter, so even if there isn’t hay available, they will still have to purchase some type of supplemental feed. All of this comes with a hefty price.” Learning of all the destruction and loss early on the morning following Harvey’s landfall, Alltech’s founder and president, Dr. Pearse Lyons, issued a company-wide call-to-action on behalf of the Texans. When word of this reached Alltech’s Ridley Block Operations managing director Earl Witham, trucks hit the road loaded with $40,000 in feed supplements, bound for the company’s Texas distributors to donate to ranchers in need. “I just have to say this,” shared Witham. “The day that it happened, the day of the hurricane, I got a call, and they said, ‘Dr. Lyons wants to do something right now.’ So, it was driven from the very top that Alltech was going to get involved; we were going to volunteer people; we were going to donate product; we were going to give as much in funds as we could. It’s a good feeling to work for a gentleman who is that giving.” Dr. Lyons' directive also resulted in the launch of \"Hope After Harvey,” an effort to raise support funds for Texas farmers and ranchers. Alltech committed to match donations made to its nonprofit Alltech ACE Foundation. As a result, company representatives presented the Texas Farm Bureau’s Agriculture Research and Education Foundation with a $42,607.12 check. The funds are providing support and relief to Texas farmers and ranchers who were affected by Hurricane Harvey. Alltech’s “Hope After Harvey” campaign resulted in a donation of $42,607.12 to Texas Farm Bureau’s Hurricane Harvey Relief Fund.

Credit: Texas Farm Bureau Boening said the hurricane was a tough blow to the Texas agricultural community, but farmers are resilient people. “If you’ve been a cotton farmer, more than likely you’re going to continue to be a cotton farmer, and if you’ve raised livestock, even though you might’ve had a setback from this storm, you’re probably going to continue raising livestock,” he said. Irma One thousand miles eastward from the Texas coast across the Gulf of Mexico, the citrus growers of Florida were already struggling with crop losses due to the bacterial disease citrus huanglongbing(HLB). Also known as “yellow dragon” or “greening” disease, HLB had infected all 32 of the state’s growing citrus counties. There is no known cure. But things finally seemed to be looking up in August when Dr. Elizabeth Steger of the Kissimmee-based Citrus Consulting International — whose crop yield forecasts have become something of a gold standard among Florida citrus growers — predicted a 10 percent increase in yield over 2016. That forecast was dashed on Sept. 10 when Hurricane Irma struck the coast of southern Florida and tied with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane as the strongest ever to make landfall in the Atlantic basin. The huge storm proceeded to barrel north, straight up the peninsula, raking citrus groves in Florida's top-producing citrus counties: DeSoto, Polk, Hendry, Highlands, Hardee and Collier.

Credit: Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Now, instead of the long-awaited growth that had been predicted, the Sunshine State’s citrus growers anticipate producing 35 percent less for 2017 than in the year before, according to Jim Ellis, financial examiner/analyst with the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. And the impact doesn’t stop at grove’s edge. Ellis noted that Florida is home to 18 fruit packing houses. In 2016, the industry packed 12 million 4/5 bushel cartons. He estimates that there is only enough citrus remaining after the storms of 2017 to fill 6 million cartons. Three packing houses can process that entire crop, he said, adding that the state’s fruit processors will pack an estimated 50 million boxes this year —down by 20 million boxes from 2016. “The industry is crippled now,” said Ellis. “The packing and processing plants can’t run at full capacity, so there is a direct impact on labor and profits.” Maria Irma was soon followed in late September by Hurricane Maria, sweeping across the Caribbean, smashing Puerto Rico with Category 4 winds and in only hours wiping out about 80 percent of the U.S. territory’s crop value, which had only weeks before been hit hard by Irma. The island suffered a loss of $780 million in agriculture yields, according to preliminary estimates by the Puerto Rico Department of Agriculture. Also taking hits from Maria were Guadeloupe, Martinique and Dominica, where crop losses were estimated at between 90 and 100 percent, decimating small-scale agriculture. Hurricane Katia had in the meantime struck Mexico on Sept. 8, dumping 10 to 15 inches of rain on northern Veracruz, eastern Hidalgo and Puebla. The winds and flooding left damage across 200,000 hectares of maize, pineapple, papaya, banana and other crops. Cyclones and typhoons Growers and producers in the Pacific basin were experiencing their own struggles with an intense cyclone season. As 2017 dawned, nearly 67,000 farmers in the Philippines were only beginning to take stock of damages wrought by Typhoon Nina. The storm struck just days before the beginning of the new year. Nina’s destruction of Philippine rice farms, coconut groves, fisheries and livestock operations topped P4 billion ($80 million USD) in losses, according to the country’s department of agriculture.

Many vanilla farms across the island nation were lost. In certain areas, the tree canopy that typically shades vanilla vines and serves as a scaffold for them to climb was either severely damaged or destroyed by the storm, placing the vines and vanilla pods at greater risk of UV damage from direct sun exposure. Pastry chefs and ice cream shops the world over have been forced to get creative. Vanilla pods are now trading at an all-time high, according to Craig Nielsen of the U.S. vanilla and flavorings group Nielsen-Massey. “Inventories were already depleted, and now we have the damage caused by the cyclone,” Nielsen-Massey told Financial Times. “It will be a tough time [for the vanilla market] for the next couple of years.” Cyclone Debbie was, at the time, inundating farms in Australia, leaving heavy damage among tomato, capsicum, sugarcane and eggplant producers. Tree crops such as mangos, pawpaw, custard apples and lychees also suffered heavy damage, according to reports. Cyclone Ockhi wiped out banana plantations and rice farms in western India. Heavy early December rains and severe flooding hit rice production in Bangladesh, and agricultural damages from major storms was also reported from Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia to Greece and Albania. Send some of that water our way! Even as many of the world’s farmers slogged through high waters to rescue or defend their crops and livestock, their counterparts in other regions of the planet suffered the opposite dilemma: severe drought. One of the worst dry spells in recent decades is devastating southern European crops. Just this year, the damage is estimated to top €1 billion. In Italy, around 30 percent less rain has fallen in 2017 compared to last year. Grains have been especially badly damaged by the lack of water and the intense heat. The drought now threatens to reduce cereal production in Italy and parts of Spain to its lowest level in at least 20 years and hit other regional crops, including olives and almonds. Spain is living through its worst drought in decades. Reservoirs have dried up. Corn, potato, beets and bean crops have died. Wildfires have wrought destruction, according to Euronews. Some farmers have said they won't even harvest this year because the overall result would be so low it wouldn't be worth the money. Rains have barely brought relief from a prolonged drought that is affecting the Horn of Africa region. Up to 75 percent of livestock has died in the worst affected areas, according to watchers.NEWS. Sri Lanka has suffered from prolonged lack of rain. The charity Save the Children reports the country’s worst harvest in 40 years. And in an ironic prelude to the hurricanes that slammed the state later in the year, Florida endured an extreme dry spell until June when just seven days of heavy rainfall, record-breaking in places, pulled the entire state out of extreme drought conditions. Even so, Florida experienced extreme heat for the entire month of July, setting a record for hottest July. Only a single day had a high temperature below 90. Fire! A severe heat wave that brought record temperatures across the western United States exacerbated North American wildfires, which by July had spread across six U.S. states and into British Columbia, Canada. More than 47,000 wildfires burned more than 8 million acres across the country, according to CBS News. Late winter of 2017 brought flames to Colorado, Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. Thousands of cattle and hogs were lost, according to Alltech’s Global Supply Chain Weekly Market Notes. Some 1,500 square miles of agricultural grazing land burned in early March. Thousands of cattle perished, and countless homes, buildings and fences were destroyed as windswept flames scorched pastures, reducing generations of hard work and dreams to ashes. In several cases, ranchers died trying to save livestock. Alltech’s Hubbard Feeds and Ridley Block Operations both teamed up to provide livestock feed relief to fire-stricken cattle producers and ranchers in the four afflicted states. In April, the Market Notes reported that the U.S. Department of Agriculture had opened emergency grazing lands previously protected under the Conservation Reserve Program in these states. By summer, the thick, black smoke and red-hot, wind-fueled flames were consuming hundreds of thousands of acres in six Western states.

The most devastating to ranchers, the Lodgepole Complex fire in eastern Montana, impacted over 270,000 acres.

Credit: Billings Gazette | Casey Page “The Lodgepole Complex fires didn't just wipe out this year; they wiped out years to come,” the Billings Gazette reported on July 30. “Many ranchers will likely have to sell off cattle to survive — losing years of carefully honed genetics. “Other ranchers will have to wait until 2019 to see new calves reach market age — and who knows how they'll make it until then,” it continued. “And for new, young ranchers, the fires may have wiped out their budding businesses before they even got on their feet.” The farming community rose to the occasion. Jerry Beggar, general manager of Alltech’s Montana-based WestFeeds, said his company joined the effort by donating supplies of feed supplements. “We’re part of a community out here and care about everybody,” he said. “With all of the expenses they’re going to incur, we tried to lighten up the load a little bit.” By Aug. 7, Seattle matched its all-time record for consecutive days without precipitation. Oregon and Washington, the states that produce most of the nation’s apples, pears, cherries and hops (for brewing beer), were battling record blazes. Farmworkers were having difficulty getting out into the orchards, vineyards and fields due to choking smoke. After California, Oregon and Washington have the highest number of wineries in the country. Together, the industry brings in more than $5 billion a year to the Pacific Northwest. But with wildfires becoming all too common in the region, growers are worried. The effects of wildfire smoke are being debated in wine circles across the West Coast. October brought even more Western wildfires, this time decimating vineyards and wineries in California’s famed wine country. According to San Francisco Chronicle wine writer Esther Mobley, “Depending on how widespread the destruction of vines is across wine country, it could mark a severe shortage of grapes for years to come. When vineyards are planted, it can take three to five years for them to bear fruit. Additionally, most Napa and Sonoma wineries hold at least three vintages of wine in barrel at any given time, not to mention the large inventory of bottles that many wineries hold back for years.” In British Columbia, the 2017 fire season has left behind the largest total area burnt in a fire season in recorded history: more than 1 million acres. “People have not only lost homes and buildings, but there’s also dead or injured cattle and the long-term health effects to some cattle,” Cody Cox, Cariboo Cattlemen’s Association president, told Business Vancouver. “The ranchers have lost miles and miles of fences; their summer and fall pastures that sustain the cattle until they sell them in the fall are burned up and gone. Some have lost their hay crops, their bales — it goes on and on.” Shaken When we think of damage from earthquakes, we tend to default to urban settings. Although risks are normally associated with densely populated cities, the effects on farming communities also can be devastating. Earthquakes sometimes trigger tsunamis, landslides and occasionally volcanic activity. The results can include injury and loss of family members and workforce, damage to irrigation systems, loss of crops and livestock, and damage to infrastructure. A powerful Sept. 7 earthquake rumbling through more than a dozen states in Mexico damaged 138,000 hectares of crops, including bananas, coffee and corn, Fruitnet.com reported. No one could have foreseen that Mexico was in for a double whammy: 24 hours later, Hurricane Katia roared ashore. Necessity is the mother of invention While meteorology is delivering ever-improving forecast technologies, we are still never fully prepared for the unpredictable realities of powerful weather-related events. These include the severe wind and flooding damages wrought by hurricanes, cyclones and tornadoes, as well as droughts that contribute to wildfires. From the citrus growers of Florida and the cattle ranchers of Montana to the vanilla bean producers of Madagascar and the farmers of southeastern Spain, 2017 has delivered more evidence of the critical agricultural assets and infrastructure that natural disasters often destroy, disrupting production cycles, trade flows and livelihoods. The number and frequency of natural disasters, along with the associated impact and damage to livelihoods and economies, are increasing significantly, according to The impact of disasters on agriculture and food security,” a comprehensive report by the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization. Food security is impacted and value chains are disrupted. Such disasters may slow overall economic growth, especially where agriculture and food production still account for a large share of gross domestic product and employment. Many efforts are underway at national and international levels to improve agriculture’s ability to anticipate, prepare for and recover from these events. However, vital systematic data and information on the impact of disasters and hazardous events in agriculture and its sub-sectors — crop, livestock, fisheries, aquaculture and forestry — remain limited. Perhaps this presents a challenge as well as an opportunity for innovation and invention.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/natures-fury-natural-disasters-and-agriculture-2017","title":"\n\n                    Nature’s fury: Natural disasters and agriculture in 2017\n                    ","date":"December 7, 2017","contentLength":3284}},{"pageContent":"With temperatures exceeding 80⁰ Fahrenheit (F), cows can produce 4,500 to 6,000 British thermal units (BTU) per hour, an amount similar to the output of a 1,500-watt hair dryer. Heat can have serious manifestations in the dairy cow, resulting in effects such as (but not limited to): • Lower production • Rumen acidosis • Milk fat depression • Poor reproduction • Laminitis/lameness • Weakened immune system • Mastitis • Transition disease (retained placenta, displaced abomasum, etc.) • Lower body condition score It is only natural when cows are moved to a small space, such as the holding pen, that body temperatures rise. Research shows that a cow’s body temperature will increase by 3⁰ F in 20 minutes in a holding pen where there’s no cooling. By contrast, a cow’s body temperature will drop by 3.5⁰ F in that same 20 minutes when fans and a soaker system are used. Research by the University of Arizona showed that simply cooling cows in the holding pen increased milk production by 1.7 pounds per day in the summer. There are can be adverse effects when developing a cooling system for holding pens if incorrectly applied. Water without fans will lead to increased humidity and heat stress in the holding pen, creating a “sauna” effect. Heat stress is a result of both temperature and humidity. The temperature-humidity index (THI) threshold for reproduction is 65,which is lower than the THI of 68 for milk production Holding pen cooling tips: Mount fans in rows, with airflow toward the back of the holding pen. Place 36-inch fans every 20 to 24 feet, or place 48-inch fans every 24 to 36 feet. Put 3 feet between fans (for example, between 36-inch fans mounted on 6-inch centers). Fan height should be a minimum of 8 feet, as low as possible but out of reach of cows and machinery. Mount fans higher if drop hose soakers like i-Wobs are used. For narrow holding pens (less than 24 feet) or pens with low ceilings, fans can be alongside the pen. Move air across and toward the back of the holding pen. Take advantage of prevailing winds.* *Prevailing winds may be blocked by cattle, freestall dividers or headlocks.

Click below to hear the full audio: Nicole: I'm talking with Deborah Wilson, senior vice president of BIXSco Inc and Viewtrak Technologies, which operates the Beef InfoXchange System (known as BIXS) based in Alberta, Canada. Deborah is a project manager of the Canadian Beef Sustainability Acceleration Pilot project, which aims to track animals through a certified sustainable supply chain. Deborah, thank you for joining us. Deborah: Well, thank you for asking me to come. Nicole: Can you tell us a little bit about how this pilot project got started and how BIXSco plays a role in this new tracking process? Deborah: I sit on the Canadian Roundtable for Sustainable Beef (CRSB), and we started, about four years ago, trying to define beef sustainability production in Canada. We have about 170 different stakeholders at the table right now, from bankers to animal rights activists, from environmental activists to groups like Nature Conservancy, Ducks Unlimited, as well as retailers — major grocery retailers, restaurant chains, processors and producer groups, feedlot groups, the cow-calf groups — were all at the table. There's been a desire to define sustainability, and so, when you put that diverse group of people together, if you are going to take on an initiative this big, everybody's voice has to be heard. So, there was no point in creating a program that didn't have the animal rights activists at the table, that didn't have the environmental groups at the table. They need to understand what we do, and we need to understand what their goals are in order to deliver. It’s been a very unique learning experience for me because I came from a producer background and, in the beginning, I honestly went to my first meeting and thought, \"This will never work.\" But three years later — if you lock enough people in a boardroom for close to 11 hours a day and feed them one meal and say, \"This is what you need to get through today and what you need to try to find the definition of or to agree on\" — it's amazing what we can do when we work together! Nicole: Three years. That's a commitment. Deborah: Yeah. Nicole: Did you see any of those stakeholders drop out along the process, or did everybody pretty much — Deborah: No, it's grown. Nicole: Wow. Deborah: Everybody has wanted to come to the table. So, we defined the indicators. We started with that — what indicates that an operation is sustainable? Then we went from there to the verification process — how do we have a third-party audit done, which really puts the “teeth” on the program? Then, what is the auditing cycle? How long are these, and how do we create that cycle? From there, we needed to determine how we track the chain of custody of the animal through all these operations, because the beef industry is not a one-trick pony. Our cattle go everywhere and anywhere. Some of them are finished on grass, some are finished as shortkeep feeders, some go directly from the cow-calf to the feedlot, so we needed a way to conduct that chain of custody. And so, that's where my company comes in. We provide that chain of custody to the whole process. Nicole: And in coming from the producer side — you've been a livestock producer for 30 years — how does it pay off to add the paperwork that a system like this might require? Deborah: We're not adding paperwork; we're trying to do it all electronically. If you look at Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL), which governs the sustainability programs or makes recommendations as to how to run a sustainability program, they advocate that you do as much electronically as possible or we'll all be buried under paperwork. How has the industry changed since I first started? Well, the paperwork has escalated; the complications have escalated. What are we looking at? The people who are buying our end-product, the beef. We have a more informed and more educated consumer than we've ever had in history. They have instant access to information via the internet. Is that information right or is it wrong? They're taking it as right, some of which we know is misleading or wrong. So, this is our opportunity to build the right message. This is our opportunity to have a conversation. This is our opportunity to say that we are worried about our environmental impact, that we are trying to be socially responsible, that we are trying to be good stewards of our animals and of the land. So, that's the changes I see. I have grandchildren that I think will be in the industry, ultimately. They're passionate about the cattle industry already, they're in 4-H, they're part of environmental stewardship programs, they're aware of all these issues, and I want them to have a future in this industry. Nicole: In a past interview, you gave an example of a farmer with 200 head of cattle fully utilizing a sustainable change management system and adding approximately $1,200 to his profit margin. How does that work? Deborah: Oh, you've done your homework. Nicole: I read a little bit. Deborah: Okay. That was a conversation that I had initially with some of the retailers. We did the first McDonald's Pilot project, and we sold it on the basis of, \"You should do this because it's the right thing.\" McDonald's spearheaded that project and had a project manager come in [who] I worked very closely with. We also had a couple of major packers onboard with that, so we logged miles and miles on the road talking to producer groups. They all agreed that it was the right thing to do, but the motivation wasn’t there. So, once that pilot project wrapped, there was a group of us who came together that have been involved in the first pilot project and are involved in the CRSB, and we said, \"How are we going to test the framework? How are we going to make the framework have credibility to the industry at large?\" It was over dinner one night, and one of the industry people said to me, \"How can I get producers involved in this?\" And I said, \"Cash is good. Cash always works.\" I said, \"We're not greedy people. It doesn't have to be a large amount of cash. But you're asking them to change some of their practices; you're asking them to pay for a third-party audit, which they are already a little scared of. If you could offer them some kind of incentive, like enough to help pay for that audit, maybe put a little extra cash in their pockets for doing the right thing, I think you'll be surprised at the uptake.\" Nicole: And, so, that's where the return is. Deborah: That's where the return is. There's a concern within the industry of, \"Yeah, yeah, so they are paying us this now…” It’s not a premium; it's a financial credit, a financial incentive to get involved to build this program. So, what I hear is, \"Yeah, but then it's going to become a program and it's going to then become demanded by the industry, and then it's going to be the norm, and then we won't get this financial credit.\" And I said, \"So, once we build this system and it becomes a norm and we maintain our market share and we keep having consumers that want to eat our product — tell me why that's a bad thing again?\" Nicole: Yeah. And what did they say? Deborah: They're usually pretty quiet. Nicole: Yeah. Deborah: There's not much they can say. Because, I don't know about you, but my purpose in being involved in this is to create longevity and a sustainable beef industry. I don't mean just that our beef is sustainable, but how about a cattle industry that's sustainable? Nicole: Since you started this pilot, have you been able to successfully track an animal from farm to table? Deborah: We've done thousands of head. Nicole: Can you tell me a little bit about what that looks like? Deborah: Visually, when you look at tracking chain of custody, it looks like a three-year-old's crayon drawing of scribbles. Our cattle don't follow any specific path. One year, a person may sell his calves in the fall, and in the next year, he's got extra feeds, so he keeps them until they're yearlings. One year, they may go to grass, they may go directly to a feedlot, they could go to an audited operation and then they may get sold, and they may go to a non-audited operation; then, they fall out of the sustainability framework. We can still track those animals, but they went through an operation that wasn't audited, so it looks like a huge puzzle. When we talk to the retailers about it, they say, \"Well, it's simple: just show us that they went here, went there, that you slaughtered them, we cut them up, we sold them.\" Then you get to show them that drawing. I have about three different visuals. When they look at the visuals, they go, \"Oh.\" They don't have any idea of what they're asking — but it's up to us to show them that this is how complicated it is, but we're willing to try and work with you to do it. It’s pretty exciting that we've been able to say we tracked this meat — or this animal — through all these verified operations. We send that off to the rest of the project management team, [and] they analyze it, they show it to the retailers. The retailers are committed to pay so many cents per pound for sustainable meat — we use industry averages to calculate the number of sustainable pounds — and then they come back and say, \"Okay, you track this many head. That works out to $10 a head in the first quarter, $20 per head in the second quarter.\" In six months, we've tracked over a million pounds of sustainable beef. Nicole: Wow. And are you using, like, a tag, or how are you keeping track of the beef? Deborah: An EID (electronic identification) tag. Nicole: Okay. Deborah: Yeah. Nicole: China has recently opened its beef market to the U.S. after a nearly 15-year ban. This new market opportunity also comes with new demands: all beef must be hormone-free. Is this blockchain technology what China is looking for to confirm a product? Deborah: Well, the biggest thing the Chinese want, first and foremost — before hormone-free — is full traceability. Then you deal with the hormone-free issue, and I think that's something, as an industry, we really need to start having conversations about. Because the next big hurdle I see on the horizon for the beef industry is our carbon footprint. It's already there. The noise is already in the background. When I talk to retailers sitting in those boardrooms at the CRSB and the U.S.’s roundtable as well, it's such an opportunity to say, \"I know you think your consumers want hormone-free, and I know they think that's what they want, but the problem is, you're taking away an efficiency in the beef production cycle that minimizes our carbon footprint.\" If you compare the difference between a serving of beef — which is four ounces — that's raised with hormones and one without, there's a 1–2 nanogram difference. I mean, you can look it up on the internet: how many nanograms of estrogen in a head of cabbage? And we'll eat a big serving of coleslaw and not think anything of it. But it's a kind of fearmongering that's been put in people's minds. I recently was at a European meeting — and, again, they have the no hormones, no antibiotics policy. That's been in place for a number of years in Europe. We have all these trade agreements that everybody is all excited about, but the trade agreements are not fitting with our current production practices. So, it's a question of, “Can we visit with these other countries to change some of their expectations and have a good conversation, or do we actually have to change our protocols here?” Then, what does that set us up for when we start talking about carbon footprint? Nicole: How difficult would it be for a producer to try to meet the export market's demands on their own? Would you have to choose to produce for either domestic or export? Can you do both at the same time? Deborah: Well, I guess you could. Yes. I mean, you're going to have to be able to if you're going hormone-free. They're going to demand some level of credibility, some level of third-party audit, I would imagine, or some verification process, and we can't do it with paper. Can you imagine if, at every stage of the game, an animal had paperwork? We saw that in the Irish Federation presentation yesterday [at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference] in the Beef Forum, and so, I know they do a lot with paper and they do it manually, but they have 16,000 producers in Ireland, both beef and dairy, in very small herds. So, when we look at the Canadian herd, which is somewhere around 13 million, and when you look at the number of head totally in the U.S., you are looking about 90 million head. We'd be buried in a sea of paperwork. So, we need to start implementing these data management systems, these state-of-the-art systems, that can then integrate with blockchain so that you can track the exact product. Then, the product comes through with a validation and a credibility behind it. So, it will be the choice of the producers who want to raise those cattle without those growth hormones. China is a huge market; it's a wealthy market. We’re going to have to demand a higher price to produce beef that way, because it's going to cost us more to produce it. Nicole: Can the Chinese afford it? Deborah: Fastest-growing upper/middle class in the world? The president of BIXS is Hubert Lau. He’s Canadian, born and raised, but his parents came from China. We do a lot of business in China through Viewtrak with another one of our products. He said, \"You have to understand the Chinese market.\" Here, we have an expression: \"Keeping up with the Joneses.\" I get a better job, I make more money, I buy a bigger house, I buy another car, I'm farming by a bigger tractor, I buy two of those bigger tractors, I get a bigger combine. Keeping up with the Joneses [means] you're proud of what you own and have. In China, they're very limited as to what they can own. You can only wear so many Rolex watches. You can only carry so many Louis Vuitton purses. You typically can't buy a bigger apartment. You're lucky if you have a vehicle. If you are going to be that wealthy and have a vehicle, you’re probably going to try to buy a Bentley. The biggest market for Bentley in the world is in China. So, can they pay for a premium product? You bet they can. And the desire for beef? It keeps increasing there. I just had that conversation with some guys that live in China and speak the language. They said beef is just a hot commodity there, whether it's in a hot pot — which uses cheaper cuts of meat — or the ability to go out one night and have a $150 T-bone steak with a $300 bottle of red wine that came from Canada or France. All of this has to come with a validation. I also talked yesterday in my presentation about the problem of food fraud globally. Beef is the fourth most black-marketed product or mis-marketed product or sold with the wrong claims. So, having that validation and that credibility is huge. Nicole: What I'm hearing is [that] buyers want a story about where their food is coming from, connecting it to the farmer. Can you explain how some of these sustainable practices get translated into the supply management system? How can the consumer see that it is more sustainable, or someone who is buying from China? Deborah: The goal of the CRSB, ultimately, is to have a label on the pack that would say \"Sustainably Raised.\" CRSB will be able to give consumers a website if they want that additional information. I mean, there are other kinds of marketing techniques that you can use to go with that, but it's all a level of insurance. If I'm tracked in a data management system as having a third-party audit, that means that an outside party came on my farm and looked at what I did for 26 or 24 different indicators. So, that adds to the story. Then, within our system, you can verify that you are a grass-only operation, or that you're hormone-free, if that's the route you choose to go; you can include the antibiotic treatments, you can verify that the animal's gone past its withdrawal periods for whatever you've given it, that it's had a good health protocol, good vaccination program, that it's Angus-only. Consumers can track genetics, if they choose. They can say, \"I'd really like to eat meat from an animal with three ears,\" and if that's what producers want us to put in the system, we'll put in a category or a field for an animal with three ears. The reality of it is, we've gone from a one-size-fits-all program in the beef industry to one-size-fits-many. How does the consumer like their product today? They like their beef with a large side order of adjectives. I have a son [who] grew up on a ranch, and he’s now a lawyer in the city. He goes to a niche market store. I asked him, \"Why would you do that? You know how the industry functions.\" He said, \"Because I like the story.\" And he has right to do that. He has the extra funds to pay for that story. So, we can leverage all of these techniques and tools we have to increase the value of our product. Why not? Nicole: Your passion is clearly for beef, but how can something like this translate or be replicated by other markets, like pork? Deborah: Oh, we've been asked by a number of different commodity groups to supply that verification in the background. We're also getting significant calls from other countries. We've been asked about tracking fish, sheep, goats, hogs — so, you're going to see our company evolve from the Beef InfoXchange System to the Business InfoXchange System, and we are going public with the company. Nicole: When do you expect that to happen? Deborah: We've done all the paperwork. We're just researching names. We want to stick with that BIXS logo. We've been accepted by the Toronto Stock Exchange, so the IPO will probably happen at the end of September. Nicole: Wow! Are we hearing it first on the AgFuture Podcast? Deborah: We announced it at the Livestock Markets Association convention in Canada, and other than that, I don't know if I said it in my presentation, but you're pretty darn close to the top of the heap right now! Nicole: I guess one of the questions I should have asked earlier is, through the three years of discussions and understanding what it means to have a sustainable beef product, is that what you'll have to figure out with the other industries too — how to define what sustainable pork is? Deborah: I say this all the time about our system: I don't want to tell you your business model, I want to hear what your business model is today and where you aspire to go — what your wish list is — because we can build a system that can deliver almost anything. I mean, you can do anything at a cost.

Question 1: Why are antibiotics in animal feed in the first place? Antibiotics have been good for the world. They have been instrumental in allowing humanity to enjoy a standard and quality of life unimagined prior to their discovery. Initially, antibiotics allowed us to control life-altering and fatal diseases in humans. Secondarily, they have facilitated the development of a modern, safe and efficient agricultural system that produces food economically, affordably and plentifully for most of the 7 billion people on the planet. When farmers began putting antibiotics in the feed of animals in the 1950s they did so initially because it resulted in lower mortalities but quickly they also noted their animals grew faster, requiring less feed. Veterinarians later observed better intestinal health and less inflammation during autopsies and surmised that the improved animal performance was most likely due to the more efficient absorption of nutrients in the intestine of those animals. Question 2: Where does resistance come from? The simple definition of resistance is “the ability of microbes to resist the effect of antibiotic drugs” and the mechanisms by which bacteria become resistant and pass on that resistance to other bacteria are relatively well known. Bacteria adapt very quickly to the environment, so when antibiotics are used continuously, the bacteria they are meant to kill can adapt, survive and replicate making it extremely difficult to kill the remaining bacteria. Resistance can develop through selective pressure (that is, when antibiotics kill some but not all of a bacterial group), mutation and gene transfer. These three mechanisms can also combine, as when bacteria not only become resistant to antibiotics, but also start to pass that characteristic on to other bacteria present in the gut. There are many sources of resistance with examples in humans and animals, including the inappropriate use of drugs or inadequate diagnostics in hospitals or veterinarian situations, the use of antimicrobial soap in bathrooms, the use of zinc oxide or copper sulfate in the diets of animals, and the use of chlorine in water of humans and animals alike. Scientists have demonstrated that these and any substances that create pressure on a microbial population lead to changes similar to the passage of resistance. Overall, humans are the main source of resistance, due to the misuse of antibiotics, not using them for the time period recommended by their doctors, or not using the recommended dose. Hospitals and homes for the elderly have become hot spots of resistance, which puts older people, very young people and immune-comprised people who are the least capable of fighting off infection without antibiotics at the highest risk. It is clear that antibiotic use in humans is not uniform. For example, looking at a map of the U.S., antibiotic misuse per 1000 people tends to be concentrated in the eastern part of the country rather than the west, with over-prescription particularly prevalent in the South and Midwest. Recent studies indicate that an average of 506 antibiotic prescriptions are administered per 1000 doctor visits, while experts concluded that only slightly more than half of these prescriptions were actually necessary or appropriate. In animals, resistance works the same way, and the passage of resistance from animals to humans can occur through contact with live animals or environmental contamination. (In 2005, the CDDEP found that when antibiotics are fed to animals 90% go through urine and 75% were found in feces; more recently antibiotic resistant bacteria have been found in water systems, waste treatment and in dust carried by air.) It also seems to be possible for resistance to be passed through the consumption of meat, milk and eggs from contaminated animals (for example, a U.S. study found that 53% of grocery chicken contained antibiotic resistant E. coli). Farmers are often irritated that activists focus on antibiotics in animal food, when the majority of resistance come from human misuse/overuse/abuse, but the general public finds it easy to agree with Prince Charles (speaking to the Royal Society in London) when he said, “I find it difficult to understand how we can continue to allow most of the antibiotics used in farming, many of which are also used in human medicine, to be administered to healthy animals.” Read the rest of Aidan Connolly's post, including the next five questions and answers, here.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/7-questions-you-were-afraid-ask-about-antibiotics-animal-feed","title":"\n\n                    The 7 questions you were afraid to ask about antibiotics in animal feed\n                    ","date":"June 16, 2016","contentLength":736}},{"pageContent":"As temperatures get warmer, our thoughts quickly turn to spending time outside, walking barefoot on the grass and enjoying lazy days on lawn chairs, sipping lemonade. Those daydreams are always colored by perfectly green grass. How can you bring those dreams of a lush lawn to life this year? We have four tips for invigorating your lawnscape, many of them taken directly from a page in agriculture’s book. It all starts underground Farmers know the importance of soil testing to ensure that the soil and plants are getting the right nutrients to help their crops. While this practice is not widespread in the home lawn area, running a soil test in early spring can be a great tool to create a strong basis for a healthier lawn. Knowing what type of soil is in your lawn will guide you to plant a type of grass that is hearty for your geographical location, alert you to possible watering concerns due to your soil type and notify you what nutrients may be lacking in your soil. You should also aerate your soil to allow for oxygen to circulate around roots and break up any compaction. The type of soil in your lawn will dictate how often you should aerate. Clay soils should be aerated at least once a year because they are prone to compaction. Sandier soils can be aerated less often. Nutrition, inside and out Once you know what kind of nutrients should be supplemented and have planted the appropriate turf mix for your lawn, you can choose what kind of fertilizer to apply. A good place to start is usually an NPK fertilizer, which is made up of nitrogen to encourage growth, phosphorus to aid in expanding the root system and potassium for plant vigor, like Alltech Crop Science’s amino acid-based Nature’s Basics®. By providing the soil and grass with essential nutrients that improve organic matter, stimulate growth and promote a healthier, more balanced plant, a home user can experience results similar to what growers around the world see in their crops. Trimming the verge To maintain grass health and decrease competition from weeds, the rule of thumb is to not mow more than one-third the length of your grass blade. Cutting the grass too short can weaken the root system and leave the grass more susceptible to stress from drought and increased temperatures. Shorter grass also exposes areas in the ground where seeds can easily take root and thrive. Taller grass, on the other hand, will have a deeper, more developed root system with wider and thicker blades that help shade the soil and minimize water evaporation during times of high temperature. Dressing for the weather In the late fall, it’s time to prepare your lawn for falling temperatures and provide a good starting point for the following spring. Apply a top dressing, spreading it in a thin layer over your lawn and working some of the material into your aeration holes. This will help encourage the decomposition of thatch and help keep the area from drying out due to winter weather. These four simple steps can go a long way in transforming your lawn from simply average to a lush landscape that you can enjoy long after the fireflies have gone for the year.

This data collection is a major undertaking, made possible only through Alltech’s global reach. However, the real work (and fun!) begins when all the data is received, and we have the opportunity to dig deep for insights and trends. We seek to answer the following questions: Which countries are growing the fastest? Which species saw declines in production? Are any major players slowing down? What are the surprises? The data presents seemingly endless opportunities for comparison, and we’ve decided to share 18 of the facts we’ve found most interesting from our 2018 data. Perhaps this will serve as “food” for your next dinner conversation! The top eight countries produce 55% of the world’s feed production. Vietnam saw an increase of nearly 1 million metric tons of aquaculture feed, contributing to the estimated 6% growth of the Asia-Pacific region’s aquaculture feed production in 2018. Morocco saw the largest growth of any country in Africa thanks to the addition of two new feed mills as well as an extension to an existing feed mill late last year. Although not typically known for its pig production, India took a big leap in pig feed production in 2018. Why? The industry is trending toward more organized farming in areas like Kerala and Punjab, with new feed millers contributing to this growth. Where’s the beef? Feed production for beef was stagnant this year. Not only that, but the third-largest producing region, Asia-Pacific, dropped enough to let Latin America step up and take the bronze. Southeast Asia’s feed production represents over 20% of the Asia-Pacific region’s feed production. Indonesia, Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand carry most of the weight and contribute to 93% of Southeast Asia’s feed production. Showing 7% growth last year and 13% this year, India is clearly growing its feed production at a rapid clip, not just in one, but in all species! From aquafeed to goat grains, India’s feed production increased across all 13 categories we assess. The European Union (EU) countries contribute to more than 50% of all major species feed production in Europe (with the exception of aquafeed). Norway is Europe’s largest producer of aquafeed, contributing 45% of the region’s total aquafeed production. Layer feed grew by 4% globally, indicating a growing need and continued interest in this efficient protein source. After years battling African swine fever, Estonia is back in the game, showing a more than three-fold increase in pig feed production over last year. Eighty percent of European turkey feed production occurs in the EU. Higher costs of corn and soy reduced Brazil’s broiler feed production by 2%, eating away at the entire region’s total and making Latin America the only region to see a decrease in broiler feed production in 2018. Dairy showed growth in all regions, indicating the ongoing affinity for this protein source. Africa’s feed production grew the most of any region at 5%. Expected to have one of the fastest-growing populations, how will this region farm in the future? Will it embrace conventional farming or leapfrog other methods and embrace Agriculture 4.0? Turkey feed saw a big leap in Spain with an additional 300,000 tons of feed estimated in 2018. Pet feed reassessed: It turns out Europe is not the primary producer as originally thought! North America leads by about 200,000 tons of feed, making it a close race. With a renewed focus on value rather than volume in the pet food sector, who will lead in 2019 and beyond? Insect protein is working its way into aquaculture feed production. It’s possible Alltech will include this new alternative feed source in future surveys! The North American regions continues its steady course of 2% growth; the biggest contributors to this increase were beef and broiler each at 3%.

More than 550 days ago, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced its updated regulations for the VFD, and now, in just a few short days, the rules will go into effect. Some producers are now scrambling to get clarity on this critically important new directive. Alltech has put together the latest information to separate fact from fiction and make sure everyone is ready to make the most of the upcoming changes. Let’s start from the beginning: What’s the VFD, again? The Veterinary Feed Directive, or VFD, will restrict the use of medically important antibiotics in animal feed. On Jan. 1, 2017, it will be illegal to use certain antibiotics without a veterinary prescription, and affected antibiotics will only be available to prevent, control or treat a specifically identified disease. Functionally, it will work as follows: Feed companies and distributors must register with the FDA if distributing veterinary feed directive feeds. Veterinarians will be prescribing veterinary feed directive drugs and must have pre-existing veterinary-client-patient relationship (VCPR); more on that below. Veterinary feed directive prescriptions may be sent to distributors by veterinarians or by hard copy delivered by clients. Drug manufacturers will be allowed to assist veterinarians and feed companies with the processing. Which drugs will be affected by the Veterinary Feed Directive? A full list is available through the FDA website, but some of the most commonly affected drugs are listed below. Remember, the list below shows the generic names and not brand names, so be sure to review the appropriate end products. Chlortetracycline Sulfadimethoxine Hygromycin Sulfamethazine Lincomycin Ormetoprim Oxytetracycline Tylosin Penicillin Virginiamycin What worries have some producers expressed about the Veterinary Feed Directive? The language around a “pre-existing veterinary-client-patient relationship” within the VFD can be confusing. To break that down, generally, this relationship for a producer requires: A veterinarian who is familiar with the producer’s operation. A veterinarian who will assume responsibility for making medical decisions on the animals involved. Medically timely visits to the premise. A producer who agrees to follow veterinary directions. A veterinarian who is available for follow-up as needed. For additional insight, a complete list of VCPR criteria by state can be found here. Dispelling Veterinary Feed Directive rumors: True and false facts Information on the VFD can be found easily, but misinformation and incorrect rumors about what the VFD is can be just as common. As the start date approaches, what are the most common rumors that need to be dispelled? Rumor: Feed-grade antibiotics are going away for good. That’s false. What is going away is the ability to use feed-grade antibiotics for growth promotion and other off-label uses. Rumor: Injectable antibiotics will be banned. That’s false. These will still be available over the counter as needed. Rumor: The VFD will affect both small and large producers. That’s true: Large or small, all producers who are found non-compliant will face a wide range of penalties ranging from fines to jail time. Rumor: Water-soluble antibiotics are not affected. That’s false. A prescription, not a VFD, will be necessary for medically important antibiotics used in drinking water. What resources are available on the Veterinary Feed Directive? Staying up-to-date on the latest information is key. Alltech highly recommends going straight to the source to get the most complete information. There are several comprehensive resources available online: The FDA website. Here you can find brochures outlining the requirements for producers, veterinarians and feed distributors, whether or not they manufacture feed. This FDA video gives an overview of the VFD. The Beef Cattle Institute at Kansas State University has created free modules on the VFD. In this webinar, Dr. Darrell Johnson from the University of Kentucky speaks in depth about the unique challenges faced by beef and dairy producers affected by the VFD.

It said, “The solutions to some of our most complicated problems are often too simple to believe. We either don’t carry the courage to implement them or we doubt the power of simplicity.” Chris Zook, best-selling author and advisory partner at global management consulting firm Bain & Company, joined us at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference (ONE19) to discuss the critical role of simplicity in business and the importance of embracing the founder’s mentality. According to Zook, the Founder’s Mentality® was created through the convergence of three factors: The speed of change in the world, which can change business strategies and decisions in a plethora of ways. Interestingly, two-thirds of executives recently surveyed reported believing that their main competitor in five or six years will be a different company than the one they primarily compete against today. Despite the widespread feeling that we are currently experiencing a period of high growth rates and low unemployment levels, in reality, only 9 percent of companies worldwide have achieved even a modest level of sustained and profitable growth over the last decade. While bursts of growth are common, sustaining growth is rare. The results of five years of researching and studying thousands of companies showed that, right now, more than 80 percent of breakdowns in the marketplace (e.g., bad product launches, losing market share in key segments, failure to be as innovative as key competitors) can be traced back to pre-existing, internal conditions that, very likely, could have been easily remedied by the company itself. The paradox of growth Growth is a key factor to measuring the success of a business, but Zook pointed out that, ironically, “growth creates complexity, and complexity is the silent killer of profitable growth.” Along with co-contributor James Allen, Zook developed the concept of the founder’s mentality, which is based on the idea that companies can become global leaders without losing the principles that first led them to success. It’s worth considering that successful companies are often considered revolutionary in their respective industries when they make their debuts. They are quick to adapt, make decisions and forge ahead. Their primary focus is their customers, and they deeply value simplicity. However, as many companies begin to grow and achieve scale, they lose sight of the core set of beliefs and values that originally helped them prosper, and this is generally when significant problems begin to arise. Zook and his colleagues’ research has shown that the majority of the handful of companies that have sustained 10 or more years of continued, profitable growth have either maintained or restored (as was the case with Starbucks) their founder’s mentality. Success from the inside out As Zook noted, “Strategic problems outside often reveal deeper challenges and the root causes of breakdown inside.” The Founder’s Mentality approach outlines three primary indicators of a business’ deep internal health and preparedness for the challenges of growth, with Zook stating that a company is 15 to 20 times more likely to be a top performer if they present and value these elements: Front-line obsession: Every founder starts as an employee on the front line, as was true with our own Dr. Pearse Lyons. He was the first person in the office every morning, and he knew the company and the science behind our products better than anyone. He was Alltech’s first salesperson, and he never stopped thinking of himself as such. Many innovative ideas stem either from working directly with customers or through observations from front-line employees; it is exactly these employees, however, who often begin to feel the most alienated as companies grow. A company’s biggest advocates should be the people on the front line of the business. A sense of insurgency: Many founders simply start with an innovative idea and a team of passionate people. Insurgency involves building for the long-term and establishing a mission that everyone in the company understands and finds inspirational. Unique capabilities are also instrumental. According to Zook, only 13 percent of American business employees report feeling very inspired in or by their workplace. Companies with a bigger percentage of employees who report feeling inspired are often well-rewarded, as motivated staff will generate far more energy and innovation for a company than their unmotivated counterparts. The owner’s mindset: The founder is also typically the owner of the company and sees the business as their baby. As organizations grow, however, founders and their employees often begin to lose that sense of pride and ownership, which is critical because it translates into a willingness to take responsibility, rather than hiding from blame, which can happen often in large, bureaucratic organizations. The owner’s mindset involves a distaste for all types of politics that differ from the founders’, but which contaminate businesses. It also involves an obsession with speed — to act and make decisions with a sense of urgency. When organizations begin to neutralize these integral aspects, they become vulnerable to younger, more invested insurgents. Four final thoughts Zook concluded his presentation with the following recommendations: Over-invest in your insurgency and what makes you unique and more than “just another company.” Create mini-founder experiences that allow you to empower and strengthen your workforce. Use the Founder’s Mentality to assess the inner health of your company. Bake its elements into how you measure yourself. Launch periodic assaults on excess complexity, which is the silent killer of profitable growth and employee energy. Use micro-battles to create microcosms of the future. Accelerate the speed of focused innovation and scale across the organization. He also shared the “Day 1” philosophy of Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos as a prime example of how to maintain a founder’s mentality: “Day 2 is stasis. Followed by irrelevance. Followed by excruciating, painful decline. Followed by death. And that is why it is always Day 1.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/chris-zook-why-founders-are-future","title":"\n\n                    Chris Zook: Why founders are the future\n                    ","date":"May 21, 2019","contentLength":999}},{"pageContent":"What does it mean that my pet’s food is “complete and balanced?” Most commercial pet foods are formulated to be “complete and balanced,\" “100% complete” or “scientifically balanced.” All these phrases mean the same thing: the pet food has been formulated to meet a recognized standard of minimum and maximum nutrients that a pet requires at the claimed “life stage” on the pet food package. The official standard for dog and cat foods in the U.S. is established by the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) through expert committees composed of veterinarians, companion animal nutritionists from academia, members of the animal food industry and the FDA. The basis for the committees is to review all current and pending nutritional information for specific companion animals. The committees recommend minimum and maximum nutrient levels that should be formulated to ensure a safe and correct diet for each stage of life. Essential nutrients versus non-essential nutrients in pet foods There are both essential and non-essential nutrients that animal scientists have identified for the dog and cat, and these vary from 42 to 48 essential nutrients depending on whether we are looking at a kitten or puppy versus a senior cat or dog. Non-essential nutrients are those that the pet can produce within its body from the foods it eats and are not needed on a daily basis. Essential nutrients are those that the pet needs daily to maintain a healthy life, and these nutrients are specified in the AAFCO Dog and Cat Nutrient Profiles. The sources of these required nutrients come from the ingredients and supplements (vitamins and minerals) that make up the recipe of the selected pet food. These ingredients are required to be listed in a descending order of inclusion amount under a section titled “ingredient listing,” which is usually found on the back or side panel of the pet food package. The names of the ingredients listed follow terms used by the FDA and AAFCO in their regulatory rules and guidelines. Balanced food depends on age and type of pet To ensure that a pet food is complete and balanced, it must meet the minimum nutrient levels for the claimed life stage of the pet at the time of feeding. There are several stages of life, each with small changes or additional nutrients that are part of the requirements. For example, since a puppy requires a higher level of protein and energy, fat levels are listed in the label guarantee because fat is an excellent source of energy needed for ensuring proper growth. Some minerals might be shown in the guarantee because they are important. Calcium and phosphorus are needed for the building of strong bones, but in large breed puppies, excess levels could cause structural problems. Likewise, kittens have a higher protein requirement than puppies and need different levels of vitamins and minerals for their growth compared to an adult cat. Complete and balanced pet food also means that proper levels of “crude protein” (an animal feed term) are available for the pet, with higher levels required for reproduction, lactation and growth. Protein is made up of many amino acids, which are components of tissues, hormones and other metabolic functions of the body, so AAFCO lists amounts for essential amino acids that must be supplied on a daily basis. Fat is another essential nutrient that is listed as “crude fat”; however, like crude protein, fat has components of essential fatty acids that are required on a daily basis, such as omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids. Vitamins and minerals can be found in the individual ingredients. However, due to processing, such as grinding, cooking, drying and storage, some of these vitamins and minerals can change or lose their bioavailability, so fortification of the diet for essential vitamins and some minerals is required. Premium pet foods typically include proteinated trace minerals due to their higher bioavailability. Like human food, pets need some fiber and carbohydrates in their diets. Even dogs have shown that they need some carbohydrates on a routine basis, and as evolution of the dog has occurred, they have developed genes that allow them to digest carbohydrates. Cats have the ability to handle a moderate level of carbohydrates in their diet quite well. Fiber plays a significant role in helping pets control the passage rate of their food in their digestive tract. With cats, it helps limit hairball formations. You will see in the AAFCO requirements that crude fiber must be listed on the label in the section titled “Guaranteed Analysis,” which shows the amount of fiber and other carbohydrate fractions found in the diet. Even though AAFCO has not set any minimum or maximum levels on crude fiber in the nutrient profiles, this nutrient, which has many components, such as sugars, ligands and starches, helps maintains the balance of a complete diet. Next time you are in the pet food aisle, check those labels to ensure your pet’s food is truly complete and balanced.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/complete-and-balanced-closer-look-pet-food-labels","title":"\n\n                    Complete and balanced: A closer look at pet food labels\n                    ","date":"October 13, 2017","contentLength":844}},{"pageContent":"What does the future hold for farming and the entire food supply chain? Everything from automated farm implements and nonstop reams of data to consumers’ ability to trace their food to its source and create supply chain reversal, according to a panel of agribusiness experts. Looking ahead into that near (and already here) future was the basis of a live video panel discussion entitled “Farming the Future.” What’s changed about what it means to be a food consumer? “I think we’re in the middle of a food movement,” said Mary Shelman, former director of Harvard Business School’s Agribusiness Program. She cited the rise of “engaged eating” — taking the consumption of food beyond simply eating to making food choices that are considered nutritious, safe, culturally appropriate and produced in environmentally sustainable ways. “A big piece of that is the millennial consumer,” she explained. “Technology is all around them. They get information in different ways. They have different values. They’re the biggest demographic group in the U.S., and they’re just at the stage of having families and moving up in their income potential, so they’re very attractive to the food industry.” Shelman noted that the millennial generation, born between the early 1980s and 1990s, has a much greater understanding of the relationship between health and food. “What they eat is part of their identity,” she said. “Food actually reflects who they are as a person, as well as their values.” This presents what, in her view, may be the food industry’s biggest challenge. “Not only do they want products that meet certain price and safety points, but they also want products that have a purpose,” she said. Shelman noted that these “prosumers” have a strong belief in their purchasing power’s ability to affect the change they wish to see in the world. They “vote” with their dollars. What’s changed about what it means to be a farmer? Aidan Connolly, chief innovation officer at Alltech, recognized that the rate of change occurring in agriculture is outpacing comprehension of its scope and scale. “I think that if anybody thinks that agriculture is going to be the same in 20 or 30 years, they’ve got their head in the sand,” he said. Connolly, who has written about digital disruptions that are currently transforming agriculture, cited those technologies: “…robots and drones, blockchain, nutrigenomics, the internet of things, virtual reality and enhanced reality — these are technologies that can fundamentally change the ways in which we understand what happens when we grow plants or animals.” Perhaps the most widely felt game-changer in agriculture has been the arrival of “big data.” “You have a tool here that looks at millions and billions of observations, whether it’s productivity, food intake, the way we grow our crops, how much rain you get — all of this can be integrated into very precise models, and that’s going to be the big change in agriculture,” said Dr. Karl Dawson, chief scientific officer at Alltech. “We’re talking about moving to ‘armchair farming.’ We’re going to be making our decisions from a site, sitting in front of a computer, looking to see what we can predict in the future. That’s a tremendous tool that we’ve never had.” What does this imply about the knowledge and skills required of the 21st-century farmer? “I think we’re looking at a fundamental change in what that person is going to look like,” said Connolly. “They won’t necessarily grow up on a farm. They might grow up in a city. They won’t necessarily have the skills of understanding animals or plants. They will understand data, analytics, equipment and decision-making about all the various technologies and which investments should and should not be made. So, dramatically different skills from those used for the last thousands of years will determine who is and who is not a farmer.” Key among those talents are analytical skills that are tied to data and information, according to Michael Boehlje, distinguished professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University. “We are going to have to increasingly develop that skill and feel comfortable with looking at numbers, looking at information,” he said. Boehlje emphasized that this doesn’t mean a farmer has to transform into a number cruncher but will need to understand the stories that the numbers tell. “It’s not just the story they (data) tell in terms of average yields,” he explained. “It’s the distributions that count. It’s what happens when you are in parts of your field where you have low yields and where you’re getting high yields as well. “The same is true with animals,” continued Boehlje. “We’re starting to see different animal performance even in the same pen. That’s a function of their genetics and a number of factors. We’re going to get more granular in the data. So, data assessment, data summarization, data visualization, strategic thinking, risk assessment — those increasingly are going to be the skills that we need to have.” Attracting a new generation of talent to farming Shelman agreed that new and emerging farm technologies will enable agriculture to be successful in meeting increasing demand, but attracting and retaining that new generation of farmers requires something more. “Supply and demand economics don’t tend to move in lockstep,” she said. “For instance, in crop farming in the U.S. today, prices are relatively low compared to other times in the last five years. So, there’s a need to maintain an economic viability for farmers to survive — and, in particular, to attract new, younger farmers.” Shelman pointed out that the average age of the American farmer today is reaching 60 years. “We need new talent, and they will only come in if there are attractive returns in the sector,” she said. This new generation is being attracted to farming for very different reasons than their predecessors. “It’s about being able to understand the market,” said Shelman. “It’s, ‘How do I deliver this differentiated product that has extra value?’ So, it’s not just about producing at the lowest price, but producing what different segments of the market want and being able to sell into those channels.” The result: supply chain reversal The industry is seeing the rise of “demand-driven chains with consumers increasingly telling the entire chain ‘what we want, how we want it and how it ought to be done,’” according to Boehlje. “So, a really important skill that is going to be much, much more important for farmers is going to be understanding and working in an interdependent system, rather than as an independent farmer, that is very focused on relationships, collaboration and interpersonal skills — things that many farmers have historically not liked to do,” he said. “But those are going to be skills that will be essential to being a successful farmer.” So, how can farmers change the way they sell foods? Consumers are moving beyond the traditional demand for cheap, accessible, safe food to shopping decisions that align with their values, according to Shelman. “I think that provides some opportunities at the farm level,” she said. “First, to become much more market-oriented and know what the market is interested in buying rather than what you want to sell.” Added Boehlje, “We’re increasingly seeing this entire food production and distribution industry move very dramatically from a commodity orientation and a supply chain mentality to a differentiated product orientation and a demand-driven system. And the technology to get that done is increasingly available.” Shelman cited as examples the rise of brands such as Laura’s Lean Beef or Pete and Gerry’s eggs, items that come with specialty propositions. “If you look at the Amazon Fresh website, you can buy hamburgers from a single cow,” she said. She acknowledged that dealing with the market at such a level is not for everyone in farming, but it’s increasingly popular among consumers. “There’s tremendous resistance in the system to making those kinds of changes because our system has been set up to move big quantities of relatively undifferentiated products,” said Shelman. Dawson cautioned, however, that there remains a messaging gap in the commercialization chain that has failed to win the buy-in of the middleman. “Alltech Angus was an example of a succulent meat product that received very good reviews, but, quite frankly, we never could make it go because there was a barrier between us and the consumer,” he explained. Still, noted Connolly, technologies enabling transparency and traceability are ushering in a new era for the farm-consumer relationship. “We are seeing very large changes in consumer behavior,” he said. “Apps on phones, websites, the ability to see through cameras what’s actually happening on the farm, to see through blockchain what has occurred in the way your food is processed — these are all tremendous opportunities for farmers to engage directly with consumers of their food, and I think, eventually, that makes for a more profitable farming system.” Success in farming, said Boehlje, will depend on an ability to move away from the mentality “If I produce it, they will come.” That, increasingly, is not the industry of tomorrow.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/farming-future","title":"\n\n                    Farming the Future\n                    ","date":"October 6, 2017","contentLength":1547}},{"pageContent":"On the heels of Alltech’s acquisition of Solbiosur in December 2016, we caught up with the people who are hard at work making this joining of forces possible. Alltech Crop Science (ACS) has been active in Europe for over 20 years. What began in the U.K., Ireland, Turkey and Denmark, where a considerable percentage of maize silage and potato crops were being treated with Alltech Crop Science solutions, soon expanded to other countries in Europe, such as Spain. Solbiosur was founded in Spain in 2007, and since then, the company has become well respected in the national market and has increased its presence in the agricultural sector. We spoke with Robert Walker, former general manager of Alltech Crop Science and current CEO of KEENAN, who was involved in the early partnering of ACS with Solbiosur; Dr. Steven Borst, current general manager of Alltech Crop Science; Jomi Bernad Blanch, Alltech regional director for Iberia; and Pedro Navarro, the commercial director for Solbiosur, to discuss the history of the collaboration and what exciting developments are expected in the near future. How did the relationship between Alltech Crop Science and Solbiosur begin? Robert Walker: In 2011, ACS collaborated with Ideagro, a private research company in Spain, and Solbiosur to run several trials on intensive crops. The success of these trials resulted in increasingly strong relationships between the two companies. Pedro Navarro: The commercial relationship with ACS began in 2012 and has grown exponentially since then. By working together, we’ve been able to improve our growers’ production plans and increase their yields. How do the companies complement one another? Dr. Steven Borst: Solbiosur has a deep understanding of ACS technology and has used this to support its growers’ needs and ensure that the appropriate solutions are being applied. Pairing with Solbiosur, ACS can leverage its global understanding of markets and help Solbiosur expand its successful Spanish model to other parts of the world. What benefits can growers expect from the partnership between Solbiosur and Alltech? Jomi Bernad Blanch: Our coming together will mean an ability to deliver greater value to our customers. Navarro: They can expect solutions to their problems, and they will know that the future of agriculture is bright. Walker: Not only will the customers have better access to products, but they will also have access to greater support and research. What are the opportunities in Spain and Europe for Alltech and Solbiosur? Blanch: We believe this development unlocks an abundance of opportunities for agricultural and horticultural crop producers not just in Spain, but across the European region. The reach of both companies has significantly increased by joining forces. Navarro: We can offer new natural-based technologies adapted to the localized markets throughout Europe and increase consumer peace of mind when they are buying their produce. Are there going to be developments on a global level that result from the acquisition? Borst: Absolutely. The ability for local countries to have this hub in Spain is a major opportunity to expand beyond the Iberian region. Walker: This acquisition increases opportunities for further collaboration in other ACS markets, such as California, Brazil, Florida and Turkey, resulting in expansion of technologies, research and the sharing of ideas. What are your thoughts about Alltech and Solbiosur’s new relationship? Navarro: When we began, we didn’t know anything about the ACS products. Now, not only can we can attest to the efficacy of the products, but we have become a part of Alltech. We have a great opportunity ahead of us. Our customers are always looking to improve their operations, and I think that together we can achieve this. Borst: We have the same focus of providing natural-based solutions that are safe and beneficial for agriculture, the consumer and the environment. Solbiosur has taken this core mission to heart, and it makes a lot of sense for us to work together as one team.

When combined with a move to a new facility, the stress of weaning can often trigger an enteric challenge in the nursery. When considering the causes of diarrhea in piglets and newly weaned pigs, focus on these three areas: sanitation, pathogen control and proper nutrition. 1. Sanitation Freshly weaned pigs have just experienced an incredibly stressful change, and that stress can be highly detrimental for their already immature immune systems. On top of this, any maternal antibodies that were conveyed to the pig from the sow will be waning within the first two weeks of placement, thereby elevating their risk from any exposure to environmental pathogens. Effective power-washing must be completed between every group entering the facility — especially if previous groups have faced a challenge. De-greasers and/or hot water will be a great help at eliminating any biofilm on floor and feeder surfaces, which cold water alone may not be able to remove. A post-washing inspection is also helpful, as spaces in the floor, under the lip of the feeder or underneath water bowls are commonly missed — and these areas can all harbor enough pathogens to make a weaned pig sick. Once the pens have been sufficiently cleaned, it is important to also select a disinfectant that will effectively eliminate the pathogens present in the facility. There are several product options on the market, all of which have their pros and cons. Select one based on its coverage, the time needed to take effect and its ease of application. For example, some disinfectants must be fully dry to achieve their maximum effect, while others work directly on or shortly after contact. Some disinfectants even have residual action after they have fully dried. It is important to ensure that you are using the correct dosage for the product to complete proper disinfection. The Center for Food Security and Public Health at Iowa State University is a great resource for obtaining a better understanding of disinfectants. Water lines are often a frequently overlooked area of the barn in need of proper sanitation. It is a good practice to evaluate the water quality in the facility. Oftentimes, water lines are full of biofilm that harbors bacteria that can be carried from group to group, meaning that a newly weaned pig’s first drink could be full of stagnant water potentially laden with bacteria. A good practice is to purge the lines with a chlorination or peroxide product between groups — but keep in mind that this could break sediment free within the lines and potentially cause plugging. There are also safe options that can be completed when an active group is present, allowing for continual flushing of the lines while the pigs are consuming water. 2. Pathogen control Of course, other equipment in the facility could also be responsible for the presence of pathogens. To avoid tracking in pathogens from the outside world, boots should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected before workers enter the rooms of newly weaned pigs. Gruel feeders and bowls should also be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected between groups. Mats are a great way to start pigs on solid feed, but if the mats are aging and fraying significantly, they can be difficult to disinfect effectively, making them a haven for disease. Feed carts, scoops, coveralls, hoses and even hats are examples of other items that could potentially harbor disease. Wooden surfaces are almost impossible to disinfect sufficiently and should be painted with latex paint to seal off any potential hiding spots for bacteria and coccidia. Next, make sure you have a full understanding of the pathogens present in the facility that are contributing to the presence of diarrhea. There are three main categories of gut bugs: bacterial, viral and parasitic. Parasitic organisms can include coccidia, roundworms and whipworms. Coccidia are an uncommon cause of disease in weaned pigs, and sanitation of both the source farm and destination farms should be evaluated if this is a primary challenge. Round- and whipworm infections take some time to develop in a group and are very rare in newly weaned pigs. A proper deworming protocol will need to be put in place if these are identified as the source of the challenge. Some examples of viral pathogens that can cause diarrhea in weaned pigs include porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), rotavirus types A, B and C, and even porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome (PRRS). Viral infections cannot be treated with antibiotics, so therapies are commonly aimed at keeping pigs hydrated and encouraging them to eat despite their abdominal discomfort. Prevention techniques include improving immunity in the sow to reduce shedding of the virus during lactation and the use of dry disinfectants over scouring groups to reduce chilling and lower environmental virus exposure. Antibiotics can be used for infections that are bacterial in nature. Some common bacterial causes of diarrhea in newly weaned pigs are E. coli, Salmonella and, occasionally, Clostridium perfringens or C. difficile. Ileitis and Brachyspira infections in recently weaned pigs are very uncommon but are possible in saturated environments. If a bacterial agent is suspected to be the cause, then a sample should be collected and cultured by a veterinarian, followed by a sensitivity test to understand what antibiotics are effective against the pathogen. It is a good practice to repeat this periodically, especially in unresponsive situations, to make sure no changes have taken place within the barn or herd. Antibiotics should always be used according to the instructions of the prescribing veterinarian in order to ensure that the treatment is effective both currently and in the future. If an infection is not responsive to treatment, then the cause should be re-evaluated to make sure there is not another factor complicating the challenge. Of course, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure, so good sanitation and biosecurity practices are paramount to preventing the exposure of pathogens to young pigs. 3. Proper nutrition A young pig has very specific nutritional needs, and if we expect too much of them, they will often fail. A big challenge with starting pigs is making sure that they all have access to the proper diet stage. In large facilities that can take weeks to fill, the amount of starter ration that the first pigs get is often much different than the amount allowed for the last pigs. Of course, bins and feed lines should be emptied between groups, as a pig’s last diet is not fit to be the first feed a recently weaned pig will eat. Finally, animals that are not eating in the pen — either because they are sick or just slow learners — will have looser stools because of their decreased solid feed intake. These animals should be placed in a separate hospital or special-needs pen so they can receive more intensive care to get back to a full feed intake. There are many factors to consider when evaluating the cause and treatment of diarrhea in a group of recently weaned pigs. Be careful not to fall into the trap of missing all of the influencing factors; otherwise, a small challenge could quickly become a crisis. Ask questions, make sure the environment is correct for the pigs’ group size and weight, get your veterinarian and nutritionist involved, and make sure to record your successes and failures as you go. With patience and understanding, even the biggest challenges can be overcome!

Yet, without enough quality feed, producers can’t produce enough pigs of good condition and good weight. In other words, they won’t make money. Converting quality feed to quality meat is what producers aim to do. But what is the process? How does a pig convert a grain-based diet into a delicious grilled tenderloin or pork chop? It all starts in the pig’s mouth To help with digestion of the nutrients, feed grains are ground into smaller particles before mixing with the other components of the final feed. All pig feed starts as mash feed — ground and mixed — but may be further processed into pellets or mixed with water for liquid feeding. The starting point for the conversion of feed to food is the mouth of the pig, which may be the most important phase. Here, the feed is further broken down by the grinding action of the teeth and by natural chemical breakdown with salivary enzymes. Afterward, the feed passes through the pharynx and esophagus and enters the stomach. Fun fact: The pH during this phase is between 1.5 and 2.5. Lemon juice, which is acidic enough to irritate your skin, has a pH around 2.2. Getting things ready in the stomach The stomach is where interesting things start to happen. Here, digestive enzymes, like pepsin, are released and combine with the feed, furthering the digestive process. Gastric glands secrete hydrochloric acid, reducing the pH and killing bacteria that may have traveled with the feed. Throughout the stomach, a coating of mucus protects the tissue from the low pH. Nutrients find a home As the chyme is released into the small intestine, digestion continues and absorption of nutrients begins. The pancreas plays a vital role here in releasing additional digestive enzymes, breaking down the proteins, fats and carbohydrates from the feed. Passing into the second and third section of the small intestine, absorption of nutrients takes place through the intestinal mucosa, which is comprised of finger-like projections called villi. Once absorbed, nutrients like amino acids and simple sugars pass through to the circulatory system. Dietary fats enter the lymphatic system and are released into general circulation via the thoracic duct. Finally, any undigested feed passes into the large intestine. Though some nutrient absorption takes place here, the main function of the large intestine is the absorption of water. With most of the water now gone, the undigested feed is condensed into a semi-solid material and passes out of the pig. Making every bite count The average conversion of feed to pork is around 2.4, meaning that for every 2.4 pounds of feed eaten, the pig will gain 1 pound. Every bite of feed not digested by the pig represents a loss for the producer. Making sure every bite counts is essential. Enzymes added to the feed can help producers get the most out of their feed by improving digestion of nutrients. Specifically, Alltech uses solid state fermentation, a process that dates back to 2600 B.C. in Egypt, to produce a feed enzyme complex. Allzyme® SSF provides enzymes that work in synergy with the pig’s digestive system, helping it to digest feed and convert it to food as efficiently as possible.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/following-pig-feed-pork-chop","title":"\n\n                    Following the pig feed to the pork chop\n                    ","date":"June 29, 2016","contentLength":564}},{"pageContent":"Farmed fish species are generally exposed to a huge variety of microorganisms that inhabit the water column within aquaculture systems. This is especially true for fish farmed in marine settings, as these species must drink large volumes of the surrounding water to maintain an osmotic balance with their environment. Such interactions between environmental microbes and those of the gastrointestinal system of fish can potentially lead to disturbances of the commensal gut microflora, which can consequently affect the normal functioning of a healthy digestive system. Support the good An increased level of positive commensal bacteria in the gut can enhance the innate immunity of fish, improve performance and help to support the efficient functioning of the gastrointestinal system. ​ Figure 1. Illustration of microvilli Extensive peer-reviewed research has shown that mannan-oligosaccharides (MOS), derived from specific yeast strains, can have a positive impact on the overall gut health of fish. Through feeding these yeast fractions, both the length and density of villi and microvilli can be increased in the gut. This translates to a larger gut surface area and supports enhanced uptake and absorption of nutrients delivered within the feed. In addition, MOS serve to fortify the epithelial layer of the intestine, thereby enhancing mucus production, which prevents opportunistic bacteria from attaching themselves to the surface of gut enterocytes. As a result, these microbes are readily removed from the fish intestine. Tackle the bad Promoting a stronger mucus layer and longer microvilli is a giant leap forward in gut health, but these benefits alone are not sufficient to guarantee optimal functionality within the intestinal tract. Alltech’s Bio-Mos® aids in normalizing gut microflora. Bacteria attach to the epithelial cells in the gut via fimbriae that recognize certain sugars on the cell exterior. Many pathogenic bacteria attach via specific type 1 fimbriae, which recognize mannose as a surface receptor, depicted in the illustration below. Figure 2. Illustration of bacterium attaching to Bio-Mos® instead of the gut surface The Alltech® Gut Health Management program is based on the unique “Seed, Feed and Weed” principle developed by Dr. Steve Collett at the University of Georgia, in which we seed the gut with favorable microflora and then feed the beneficial resident bacteria, maintaining a natural intestinal environment. Through these interconnected processes, we can subsequently weed out potentially unfavorable microorganisms and strengthen the immune defense system of farmed fish. Avoid the ugly In modern aquaculture, ensuring optimal gut health is more vital than ever before. We want to avoid ugly situations and produce farmed fish as responsibly as possible, which means the maintenance of optimal water quality parameters is of paramount importance. Every farmer continuously strives to improve the performance of their livestock, and this also applies to terrestrial farms. Fish farmers focus predominately on two key aspects to maintain productivity: the reduction of feed costs and the improvement of growth performance rates. By implementing our gut health management program in combination with our dedicated on-farm support, we can achieve: Enhanced growth performance, which drives a shorter production cycle. Optimal immune defense, which means reduced treatments and veterinary costs. Strong, robust fish with an optimal fillet quality that satisfies consumer demands. Highly efficient, responsible and sustainable aquaculture practices. Interested in having our experts help you to achieve optimal gut health in your farmed fish?

In China they can do what? Where on the planet can you try out a new beer, share photos of the brew on social media, buy a six-pack through that same social media channel and have it delivered to your doorstep? In the world’s biggest beer-drinking market: China. Chinese consumers — as a group, the world’s largest — spent $5.5 trillion on all sorts of purchases made through mobile payment platforms last year. That’s about 50 times the amount spent in this manner in the U.S., according to the Financial Times. And well-positioned to accommodate a rapidly changing consumer landscape across China is Alltech Brewing. “They can go on our WeChat channel,” said Dr. Mark Lyons, global vice president and head of the company’s Greater China division. “They can say ‘I just had a Kentucky Ale®’ and they can actually order it directly through that app.” That’s a far cry from the China of not all that long ago. Most Chinese over age 55 readily recall the austere conditions of the Cultural Revolution of the ‘60s and ‘70s. If in those days you had suggested that private consumption would someday be a significant force in the Chinese economy, no one would have believed it. But over time, the nation’s industrialization has steadily increased mainstream affluence. Frugality is giving way to consumerism made affordable by discretionary income. Younger generations, driven by digital technologies and social media, are entering the market relatively free of the influences of the past. “The pace of change in China is very, very fast, and a mere couple of weeks can change the entire dynamic, which means that strategies must be adapted,” said Mark Lyons. “The Western model of quarterly plans or even annual plans does not fit well where competitors can be operating in a much more real-time pace.” In a report entitled “Meet the Chinese Consumer of 2020,” the McKinsey Quarterly notes that an outcome of this noticeable trend in consumer spending “is a propensity to trade up, driven increasingly by consumers aspiring to improve themselves, the way they live and their perceived social standing. Many Chinese, like their Western counterparts, judge themselves and others by what they buy.” In its own analysis, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) forecasts nearly 35 percent of the population, or around 480 million consumers, will meet its definitions of upper middle-income and high-income by 2030. That’s larger than the entire U.S. population of 321 million. The EIU predicts that the portion of the Chinese population defined as low-income will shrink from 36.9 percent in 2015 to just 11 percent in 2030. “There will be a corresponding bulge in the middle-income bracket, with a growing portion of the population falling within its upper reaches,” stated the EIU in a recent report. “The share of high-income consumers, with annual disposable income of above RMB 200,000 (US $32,100), will rise from just 2.6 percent in 2015 to 14.5 percent in 2030. China will look and feel like a more middle-class society.” The trend is altering the consumer landscape in the world’s most populous nation as this rapidly emerging middle class expresses changes in preferences and tastes, upgrading consumption habits and switching to more expensive and premium brands — including the libations selected for personal consumption and entertaining. A key to the success of Alltech’s beverages in China has been savvy pricing, according to Patrick Lin, Asia manager of Alltech Brewing. “In the past, the highest-selling alcohol products were either on the lowest end of the price scale — mass-produced beer and spirits — or in the highest range — cognacs, high-end wine, etcetera,” said Lin. “Now, the new middle-class consumer is demanding something that’s in-between. “They no longer want the lower-priced beer their parents drank, and at the same time, they don’t want to spend the massive amounts that previously were spent on luxury alcohol products that were consumed as gifts and at banquets,” he explained. “The middle class wants to go out to restaurants and bars that are offering unique products and environments that are affordable, but not cheap.” The China beyond Shanghai and Beijing China is an immense nation of 31 provinces, its regions so diverse that the whole resembles a collection of separate countries. “I often see companies coming in and seeing Shanghai, maybe Beijing, and assuming that they understand the country,” observed Mark Lyons. And that, he says, can be a fatal mistake. “Many subregions are very different in not only their levels of development, but personal, cultural preferences, in terms of the types of products consumers are looking for, but also business practices,” he explained. “This is where it is crucial to have local people in each market. We have representatives in virtually every province of China, and our regional representative offices help us considerably to be able to be more in touch with these local changes.” Alltech founder and president Dr. Pearse Lyons has long been preparing his company to capitalize on the transitions now occurring in China. Alltech has 250 employees in the country, spread among offices in Chengdu, Guangzhou and Qingdao, with a factory in Tianjin and another expected to open in southern China. “We have been in China for over 25 years,” he said. “We know the marketplace, and they know us. Therefore, to bring the beer in was almost like a logical extension. We decided to go to the market, so we reached out to our connections. We already had the resources there. They were well-educated, could speak the language and were Kentuckians. We needed to give them something that fit, like Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale®.” With the launch of Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale in China five years ago, Alltech became the first independently owned American craft brewery to produce beer in China for national distribution. The division now sells 10 different brews made by Alltech, including Kentucky White Ale® , a citrus wheat beer that recently joined the beverage line. Sales expanded to Taiwan in 2015, then on to Hong Kong and Japan. Today, Alltech Brewing is the largest independently owned American craft brewery operating in China. Alltech’s spirits were introduced to the market three years ago, including Town Branch® Bourbon, Town Branch® Rye, Pearse Lyons Reserve® and Bluegrass Sundown®. The Foxes Rock™ brand appeared two years ago, and 2017 has seen the addition of Ha’penny Pot Still Gin®. The brands are stocked in stores and restaurants in more than 400 locations across Greater China, including nearly all of the largest cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, Shenzhen, Chongqing and Tianjin, as well as in Hong Kong and Taipei. The current sales focus, according to Mark Lyons, is on cities where palettes have long been accustomed to big Chinese beer brands such as Tsingtao, Yanjing and Snow. “We’re offering something to them that looks completely different,” he said. “It’s probably three times higher in alcohol, has a very different flavor and is presented in different ways. Just getting them to try a beer is one thing. Once they do that, we see the same thing that’s happened all around the world: that conversion happens rapidly.” And he believes the beverages’ appeal extends far beyond the city limits of China’s sprawling urban centers. “It’s not even just second- or third-tier cities,” explained Mark Lyons. “It’s already down to communicating directly with our customers on the agricultural side who are in really small places where these sorts of products are not accessible.” Quite a different picture in Japan Alltech’s 2017 arrival in Japan required a recognition of dynamics that are in stark contrast with those in China. Due to the steady aging of the population and low national birthrate, the Japanese drinking population is relatively small. But the Japanese, observed Mark Lyons, make up for it with attention to quality. “You already have this very high level of affluence,” said Mark Lyons. “The focus on quality is extraordinary. There is such attention to every single detail. It’s a super-premium market, and I think that’s where our products can fit very nicely.” With 290 craft breweries, according to a 2017 global craft beer survey released by The Brewers Journal and Alltech, Japan leads China (170 breweries) and Taiwan (22 breweries) among Asia-Pacific craft brewers. Australia holds the regional lead with 410. The Asia-Pacific region, however, accounts for a mere 7 percent of global craft brewery production. Raising a pint to opportunity and partnership in China When asked to consider Alltech Beverage’s most important achievement, Mark Lyons cites its presence and stature as the largest American craft brewer in China. “That provides us with a platform for growth, which we’re very, very excited about,” he said. And that growth works to the benefit of others. “We’re beginning to sell other people’s beers,” he said. “We’re in discussions with several large American craft brewers (about) helping them come into the market.” He notes that many craft brewers cast a wary eye in the direction of the brewing giant AB InBev and its self-titled “Disruptive Growth Organization.” The company is investing in craft breweries and craft beer bars in the Asian market. “Many independent craft brewers are worried about this,” said Mark Lyons. “They’re concerned about middlemen and ‘gray channels,’ and they’re hesitant to get in. But when they see a company doing the types of things that we’re doing, it gives them a lot of confidence. So, we’re getting a lot of people knocking on our door. We’re seeing it as a great opportunity to provide customers with a truly independent and unique product.” By 2020, predicts the McKinsey Quarterly, “companies (operating in China) that have focused on maximizing their brands’ scale will have to adopt a model based on a portfolio of more targeted brands or sub-brands to connect with different consumer segments.” “Our more recent strategy on the beverage side to expand our product portfolio, including other companies’ brands, and also to diversify our own portfolio, is a response to this type of feedback from the market,” said Mark Lyons. “It is clear that, without a great number of price points and brands that appeal to different demographics, it is difficult to really scale a business in a sustainable way,” he continued. “We have to be thinking about a market for us, in terms of craft beer, that within a little bit over a decade will have three to four times more accessible consumers.” There are challenges to navigate, warns the EIU analysis: “China’s economic trajectory has become more uncertain, and firms will need to monitor risks accordingly in order to stay ahead of the curve.” Pearse Lyons sees opportunity. His vision for the company’s beer and spirits interests in Asia is broad and has yet to be fully realized. “We are actively looking at producing in other areas,” he said. “Keep in mind that we have Alltech Vietnam, Alltech Philippines, Alltech Malaysia, etcetera. Some of these offices are older than Alltech China. “We can use Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale as a major differentiator for us,” Pearse Lyons continued. “The strategy has been: use the beer, use the Kentucky name. We have a unique product to promote Alltech and our home state. It will slowly but surely build up the brand image.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/pint-potential-worlds-biggest-beer-market","title":"\n\n                    Pint potential in the world’s biggest beer market\n                    ","date":"July 14, 2017","contentLength":1927}},{"pageContent":"The 24th International Pig Veterinary Society Congress, held June 7–10 in Dublin, Ireland, hosted more than 3,000 experts in the pig veterinary industry to discuss the challenges of antibiotic resistance and the long-term outlook for antimicrobial use in the pig industry. At the Alltech Elite Herd Dinner, keynote speakers Dr. Ana Catharina Berge, owner of and veterinary consultant at Berge Veterinary Consulting BVBA, and Dr. Richard Murphy, research director at Alltech’s European Headquarters and Bioscience Center in Dunboyne, Ireland, addressed 20 of the world’s leading veterinary practitioners, nutritionists and technical managers. Murphy spoke fervently regarding the critical issues surrounding antibiotic resistance and its role in animal protein production. He also shared possible strategies whereby livestock producers may position themselves as antibiotic-free. “I don’t want to sound sensationalist, but without efforts to reduce reliance on antibiotics in livestock and animal production, we could be heading for an apocalypse scenario,” said Murphy. Berge explained how many European countries now have antibiotic reduction plans. Sweden, Finland and Norway, for example, have prohibited prophylactic/growth promoting use since the 1980s, with registration and veterinary control required for all antimicrobials. Considering this, she posed the question: Can we do more as producers? Benchmarking is important in the pig industry as it allows producers to set clear goals against best practice, production and efficiency models. By measuring specific metrics on farm, the producer can become more efficient, profitable and sustainable. “Benchmarking is big in Belgium and it is something we could all learn from. The country has adopted a clear reduction approach, which is systematic, well analyzed and allows all producers to participate,” said Berge. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), “one of the most common routes of transmission for infectious agents is direct pig-to-pig contact: movement of infected pigs in close physical contact with non-infected pigs is decisive in transmitting diseases.” Biosecurity, procedures or measures designed to protect the population against harmful biological or biochemical substances, has become a popular topic in agriculture due to an increase in disease transmission. In the coming years, we will see an increase in biosecurity on-farm. Efficiencies, through biosecurity, will allow pig producers to reduce antibiotic use and treatment costs, resulting in higher productivity. “The antibiotic reduction program (Alltech Antibiotic-Free program) by Alltech is an industry-initiated program whereby farms may get total herd audits and recommendations for efficient performance and increased herd profitability with resulting reduction in antimicrobial use,” said Berge. In addition, there are multiple measures pig producers can take to reduce the transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the food chain, including: Routinely monitor and develop a list of pathogens in a pig population, which is vital to the success of an antibiotic-free system. Identify the challenges affecting productivity and profitability on-farm, as well as aspects of housing, husbandry and management that may be causing issues. Re-evaluate biosecurity both internally and externally. Examine herd flow, cleanliness, transportation and employee traffic. Establish and implement an effective vaccination program with the veterinarian that supports herd health and safety. Build a nutritional platform in the pigs’ diet that includes technologies to reduce the risk of pathogens and improve immunity. Be ready to adapt. Reducing antibiotics or implementing an antibiotic-free program takes time. Observing how these changes impact the animals’ health and production is an important part of this process. Make sure there is room in the plan to make improvements.

Bedding Winter temperatures bring additional challenges and considerations to the table for dairy producers. As temperatures drop, calves’ energy requirements increase. Calves under 21 days of age require more energy when temperatures fall below 60° Fahrenheit and also require 30 percent more energy simply for maintenance when temperatures fall below 30° F. Bedding is a good source of insulation; as such, to reduce heat loss, keep calves dry and well-bedded. Dry straw bedding up to their knees provides good insulation and reduces their chance of contracting respiratory disease. In addition, clean, dry calf jackets can increase the internal temperature of a calf by up to 25° F. 2. Feeding Feeding calves three times a day will help stabilize the rumen pH while simultaneously adding more energy during cold temperatures. Additionally, provide free-choice warm water right after feeding to get the calves drinking water before they lie down. Remember, warm water freezes faster than cold water. 3. Water Speaking of water, dairy cows must drink water or they will not eat. Since water is a key ingredient in making milk, be sure that the waterers are clean and not frozen. Cows prefer plate cooler water because it is warmer than well water. With a thermometer, check waterers with heaters to determine if elements are working properly. An ideal water temperature is between 40–65° F. 4. Ventilation – Prevent drafts Dairy cows will do quite well in cold temperatures, provided they are dry and protected from wind and drafts. Cows can tolerate temperatures as low as -20° F if wind speeds are below five miles per hour. On the other hand, high winds of 35 miles per hour and temperatures above 15° F can cause problems for dairy cows. With cold weather, it is important to prevent drafts; cows need a dry, draft-free resting place. Patch holes in curtains, minimize gaps at the ends of curtains and seal around doors where wind can blow through. In stall barns, proper maintenance of barn wall fans is key to good ventilation. Adjust and replace belts and keep shutters and other parts clean and lubricated. Fresh air inlets must allow air into the barn to replace “old air.” Regardless of the type of barn, it is important to have ample amounts of dry bedding. Keep the back of the stall groomed or scraped. If walkways become frozen and slippery, put down lime to allow for better traction. 5. Prevent frostbite Another critical area to consider when it comes to mature cows is whether they are exiting the parlor into wind chill conditions that can lead to frostbite and frozen teats. It is very important that teats are dry when leaving the parlor during cold weather. Dairy scientists suggest that, in severely cold weather, even the film of milk should be dried before cows leave the parlor. Instead of skipping the post-dip, it is better to post-dip the teats and allow 30 seconds of contact time before wiping the teats dry. Use germicidal dips that contain 5–12 percent multi-skin conditioners to reduce chapping or cracking of teat skin. Avoid washing teats with water in cold weather. 6. Mastitis – Dry teats and singe udders Finally, in cold weather — or during the summer — reducing the places that organic matter can stick to a cow is critical to managing somatic cell count and mastitis. To prevent this from happening, singeing udders just prior to calving, at dry-off and during lactation, when the hair is visibly long, is suggested. Following this standard operating procedure (SOP) reduces the sediment load in the milk filter, makes it easier to prep cows and reduces the risk of environmental mastitis. This procedure can be done in head-locks or in the close-up area — but not in the parlor, if all possible.

The onset of fall weather means harvest season is upon us. During this time, farmers have much work to do in a short time. That sense of urgency can lead to accidents and damage that might otherwise have been prevented. While we want you to accomplish your tasks efficiently, we’d like to ensure you do so safely. Therefore, we’ve compiled some recommended safety guidelines that should be useful reminders during your busy season. Equipment and operator safety Harvest inevitably means long hours spent behind the wheel of heavy machinery, and the safe completion of related tasks depends on both overall knowledge and attentiveness. It’s perfectly normal for us to take pride in our work, especially if that means putting in long hours in pursuit of a common goal. This is particularly evident in harvesting operations. Yet exhaustion and sickness regularly contribute to accidents in the field. It is important to recognize what your body is trying to tell you. If you aren’t feeling your best, consider turning the operation over to a trusted friend while you recover. Keep in mind these safety tips: Take regular breaks to aid in divvying up the monotony of machinery operation. Turn off engines, remove keys and wait for all moving parts to stop before getting out of machinery. If you are going to eat in the field, climb down from the combine and relax for a little while. Dress with both comfort and safety in mind. Wear protective footwear and close-fitting clothes. Proper safety gear should be worn at all times around dangerous noise, dust or hazardous materials. Turn equipment off before making any repairs or adjustments. Do not remove safety shields, roll bars or guards. They are there to protect you. Grain bin safety Farm workers should all know the hazards of flowing grain and how to prevent a grain entrapment situation. When grain is being unloaded from the bottom of a bin, it flows downward from the top center, creating a funnel effect. If a person is on top of the grain in a bin being unloaded, they can be pulled into the flowing grain within a matter of seconds, likely rendering them helpless and potentially resulting in suffocation. Anybody who works with grain, in any capacity, must be aware of the dangers. If you must enter a bin, it is vitally important to follow these safety precautions: Shut off and lock all unloading equipment before entering a bin. When possible, ladders should be installed inside grain bins as emergency exits. Avoid entering the bin when possible. A long pole can be used to break up crusted grain instead of having a worker enter the bin. Grain that has crusted can cover open spaces, which likely will not support the weight of a person. Wear a harness that is attached to a properly secured rope. Stay near the outer wall of the bin. If the grain starts to flow, move to the bin ladder or safety rope as quickly as possible. Never enter a bin alone. Have at least one person stand outside the bin, someone who can help you should you become entrapped. It is best to have two people available who are properly trained to follow all safety procedures for entering the bin. Wear a dust filter or filter respirator when working in a grain bin, especially while cleaning. Do not allow children to play in or around grain bins, wagons or truck beds. Farm equipment road safety If you need to drive your equipment on any roadways, you should consider the following safety tips: Increase visibility by using the equipment’s lights and flashers, especially during inclement weather or when light is low (early mornings and evenings). Avoid busy roads whenever possible. If there is a line of cars behind you and a suitable shoulder is available, pull over and allow traffic to pass before proceeding. It is our hope that, by following these and other appropriate farm safety guidelines, you will have a productive and safe harvest not only this year, but for many years to come.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/tips-safe-harvest-season","title":"\n\n                    Tips for a safe harvest season\n                    ","date":"September 12, 2017","contentLength":697}},{"pageContent":"The way producers use and purchase antibiotics has begun to change, with further regulations from the Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) going into effect Jan. 1, 2017. What restrictions are being put into place? How will they affect producers? What do you need to know to be prepared? Dr. Darrell Johnson, director of regulatory services at the University of Kentucky, shared all you need to know in the webinar “What does the VFD mean for me?” Here, we look at some of the highlights. Antibiotic usage has traditionally had four purposes: treatment, control, prevention of illness and low-level feeding to promote feed efficiency. Moving forward, feeding antibiotics for feed efficiency will be eliminated completely, and only on-label use of antibiotics will be allowed. Antibiotics for the first three reasons listed above will be allowed, but only with a veterinary feed directive if in feed or a prescription if in water. Injectables are not affected at this time. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found in a 2013 report that half of prescriptions given to humans are unnecessary. This misuse contributes to growing antimicrobial resistance as bacteria become resistant to drugs to which they are exposed. Though it is uncertain what role antibiotic use in livestock production plays in the overall problem, the FDA is already taking preventive action regarding antibiotic use in livestock, targeting drugs that are medically important to humans. Veterinarians will begin to play an even more critical role than before in the feeding of antibiotics through feed or water, since the status of many antibiotics will be changed from over-the-counter to prescription or veterinary feed directive only. The goal is to keep veterinarians involved in decision making about the feeding of these drugs, even though a veterinarian is not required for their administration. Antibiotics affected by the U.S. Veterinary Feed Directive Starting Jan. 1, 2017, the following antibiotics will require a prescription: Apramycin Penicillin Chlortetracycline Streptomycin Erythromycin Sulfadimethoxine Hygromycin B Sulfamerazine Lincomycin Sulfamethazine Neomycin Sulfaquinoxaline Oleandomycin Tylosin Ormetoprim Virginiamycin Oxytetracycline 7 key takeaways As of Jan. 1, 2017, claims for production and feed efficiency on veterinary feed directive medications will be eliminated. Sales of these drugs will require a veterinary feed directive if going into feed and a prescription if going into water. Feed companies and distributors will have to register with the FDA if distributing veterinary feed directive feeds. Veterinarians must prescribe the veterinary feed directive and retain the original copy, and both client and distributor must maintain a copy for two years. Veterinarians must have a valid veterinarian-client-patient relationship to write a veterinary feed directive prescription. Veterinary feed directive prescriptions may be sent to distributors by veterinarians or by hard copy delivered by clients. Manufacturers of the drugs will assist vets and feed companies with the paperwork. Because of these changes, it’s more important than ever to learn about options and opportunities to help maintain health and growth in livestock. Bio-Mos® and Actigen® are unique feed supplements of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which benefits dairy cattle by fundamentally maintaining gut health and stability.

Chipotle has been a leading advocate of food chain transparency while also endeavoring to elevate the experience of fast food. The company embodies the “fast casual” definition – a step above fast food but not quite a sit-down restaurant. “It sets the standard for the future, and specifically, a tremendous commitment to sustainability,” noted Connolly. Yet, in 2015, Chipotle suffered a crushing food safety crisis when more than 500 customers reported being affected by E. coli, norovirus and Salmonella over a seven-month period from July to December in the United States. Food safety experts estimated that among 500 people that were affected, at least ten of the cases went undiagnosed. Steve Ells, Chipotle’s founder and co-CEO, publicly apologized to everyone who’d fallen ill. Demonstrating remorse and resolution, he announced a more comprehensive food safety program and changes to the company’s supply chain. However, this should have been done after the first case was reported. “When you have that crisis you need to demonstrate the usual three rules: (1) You have a clear person in charge, (2) you have a plan of action to address the problem and (3) the plan is working. I think Chipotle has done that but a little late having five issues in a row,” said Connolly. Despite the apology and renewed commitment to customer safety, the crisis’ effect on the brand was devastating. Chipotle’s crisis has significantly widened the gap between analysts’ high and low stock-price targets in two months, after the E. coli outbreak was reported. “There’s nothing worse from a trust perspective. This is not the kind of problem that you can market your way out of,” said Mark Crumpacker, then chief marketing and development officer, Chipotle. Chipotle went from a company that portrayed themselves as sustainable to being perceived as causing life-threatening diseases. Consumers thought the brand was “smug” and didn’t take it seriously enough in the beginning. “We need to be clear that the fact of something being organic or natural is not an excuse for it to be unsafe,” stated Connolly. Chipotle was facing lawsuits, supply challenges, brand attacks, slowing sales and first quarter losses. Shares have fallen more than 40 percent from all-time high of USD $742 in July last year. Restaurant growth has also been a lot slower. Nonetheless, Chipotle is bouncing back by proving they took the issue seriously through changes in internal trainings, practices and suppliers. “Chipotle still has a very strong image and brand reputation for taste and uniqueness, but they cannot afford another mistake,” noted Connolly. Chipotle is far from the first or last food company to be caught in a crisis. Connolly had some advice for all companies. “We have one hour, the ‘Golden Hour’, to react to a crisis. What you do in the first hour is absolutely essential,” said Connolly. Connolly recommended a strategy for businesses when faced with a crisis: Acknowledge the situation within the “Golden Hour” Promise to discover the cause, be relentless in this pursuit, share your findings and, most importantly, the actions you are taking to prevent any recurrance Keep updating the public Engage on social media The bottom line is: A food safety crisis can be more preventable through proper crisis management, via four stages: 1. Prevention: Employ a good food safety program. This is a minimum requirement. Stay current on risk factors Integrate from top to bottom. All members must follow protocol. One conclusion from the Chipotle crisis is, when there are problems in several states within a few months, you have a systemic problem that you need to address in terms of education to your employees. 2. Preparation: Proactively plan: Study other companies’ successes and failures Monitor public discussion: Know where your customers communicate and use social media to stay in control 3. Management: Acknowledge the issue Buy time to get the facts Do not deny involvement or responsibility Do not attempt to estimate the magnitude of the problem Commit to a speedy, but thorough investigation 4. Recovery: Reassess your risk exposure at the end of the crisis Explain implementation of changes Evaluate again one year later to measure progress against your risk mitigation goals","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/chipotle-crisis-crucial-lessons-cautionary-tale","title":"\n\n                    The Chipotle Crisis: Crucial lessons from a cautionary tale\n                    ","date":"July 26, 2016","contentLength":741}},{"pageContent":"Traditionally, meat has been considered a commodity — that is, a mass-produced good with a low level of differentiation. One of the most important characteristics of commodities is the high volatility of their price because, by their nature, they are very sensitive to changes in production and demand. In the search for better prices for meat, some brands are trying to differentiate and add value to their products. Globally, consumers are increasingly more aware that better nutrition represents one of the main pillars of good health — which has led to a trend of new lifestyle choices in recent years. This new way of understanding what we choose for our tables brings with it greater expectations regarding the food supply. Therefore, the challenge for producers — and the food industry in general — is to have tools on hand to help them cope with and anticipate the new eating habits of consumers seeking a better quality of life. Inspired by this new global trend, the Wong supermarket chain in Peru — owned by the multinational business consortium Cencosud — saw the opportunity to serve a segment of the Peruvian market that seeks a healthy, balanced and natural diet. In addition, they understood that it was necessary to find and become allies with a national producer who raised top-quality cattle that would meet the needs of this new market. The Finca Nueva Farm, located south of Lima, is a family business, established almost half a century ago. Since its founding, its vision has been to produce high-quality cattle to satisfy a demanding market. For Ricardo Heredia, son of the founder of the business, being passionate about livestock is essential in order to innovate and grow. Heredia knows that animal welfare is key, since it is reflected in the quality of the meat. Therefore, he does not neglect the important aspects of livestock care, such as offering comfort to animals — by providing good feeders, drinking troughs with clean and fresh water and adequate shade areas for the animals' rest, as well as a well-balanced diet. Heredia is aware that consumers are passionate about nutrition, sustainability and traceability, so he continually seeks to adapt and develop new products, while meeting the international certification standards. When he and his farm decided to focus on producing premium-quality meat, to achieve certification of good livestock practices, they looked for hormone-free solutions that would leave no residues of antibiotics in the meat, and they were also interested in implementing a good traceability system. The Wong supermarkets and the Finca Nueva Farm were also interested in feeding an organic form of selenium. Including selenium in an animal’s diet can be beneficial in that it contributes to: Maintenance of animal health by supporting the animal’s natural defenses Superior meat quality, with differentiated parameters such as better color, texture and juiciness Perhaps most importantly, the meat on carcasses supplemented with organic selenium will contain that antioxidant. Thus, the consumer who buys, cooks and consumes this meat will benefit not only from the nutrients of the meat, but also from the benefits of selenium. Functional food In the field of nutrition, functional foods are those foods or food products that, in addition to their inherent nutritive substances (i.e., proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins or minerals), also contain a specific substance added for health benefits. Thus, a processed food such as milk will become functional if it is enriched with some type of additional vitamin, such as Complex B. Besides having its traditional characteristics of proteins, calcium and more, the milk now also has the added benefits that come from Complex B, making it a functional food. Selenium is an essential nutrient for both animals and humans as it plays an important role in metabolism, supports growth, helps improve reproductive functions, improves the body's defense mechanism against infections and neutralizes free radicals, given its antioxidant function. Alliance in favor of the consumer Alltech Sel-Plex® is the only organic selenium in the form of selenium yeast that has been reviewed by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration). Wong, in alliance with the Finca Nueva Farm, decided to feed Sel-Plex® to their Fleckvieh cattle, a breed of European origin. Subsequently, they carried out tests in the slaughterhouse, where they made the cuts and packed the meat vacuum. These cuts, which matured for more than 10 days, showed results that helped differentiate this meat from the other meats on the supermarket shelf, thus allowing for decommoditization. I would like to receive more information on beef nutrition.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/meat-decommodification-case-differentiation-peruvian-market","title":"\n\n                    Meat decommodification: A case of differentiation in the Peruvian market\n                    ","date":"February 18, 2019","contentLength":756}},{"pageContent":"The first animals to be domesticated by humans were wolves, although the jury is still out on when exactly this occurred. Now a menagerie of animals is considered companion animals or pets, from the fuzzy chinchilla to the majestic horse. The original reasons for domestication were as varied as the species themselves: protection, hunting, travel and companionship. Today, pets are considered by their owners to be members of the family. They have their own toys, a special place on the sofa or even their own room. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Americans individually spent an average of $500 on their pets for a collective total of $66.75 billion, three times more than 20 years earlier. Their growth in spending is being outpaced by China, where pet lovers are estimated to spend 50 percent more by 2019. With a human population 4.5 times larger than the U.S., this may soon become the world’s biggest market. The European pet industry is also fairly substantial and, according to EuroDev, is expected to grow to $36.4 billion USD by the end of 2017, with the biggest markets being France (16.5 percent), Germany (16 percent) and the U.K. (15.3 percent). As the population increases, the middle class grows and new geographic markets develop, opportunities abound in the pet sector. Additionally, advances in technology that have been disrupting many other industries are certain to have an effect. Traditional pet products and emerging technologies are converging, opening up never-before-seen opportunities. Following the eight digital technologies framework* I’ve used in previous blogs, what could disrupt the companion animal market? 1. 3D appendages? These doggie knee implants are created using a 3D printer. Image courtesy of 3D Systems. 3D printing can offer veterinarians novel life-saving techniques for pets. 3D Systems has partnered with Rita Leibinger Medical to create and print titanium orthopedic knee implants for dogs. They have reported nearly 10,000 successful implants using a procedure they call tibial tuberosity advancement (TTA). TTA eliminates the need for a veterinarian to repair the ligament because it stabilizes the joint using a titanium implant, which speeds up both the surgery itself and the animal’s recovery time. While it may sound expensive, TTA actually costs significantly less than traditionally hand-built prosthetics. There are many incredible tales of second chances — a duck with a new silicone foot, a cat’s knee implant and a pup’s prosthetic legs. Though not designed solely for animal and veterinary use, several companies have now created prosthetics for animals: NovaCopy, Stratasys, MakerBot, 3dyn and BTech. 2. Are robotic dogs man’s new BFF? Move over, Fido, man’s new best friend is…a robot? Robotic “Rover” has certainly done well in Japan, where Aibo (Sony) engineered a robotic dog in 1999 that was designed to learn about its owners and to react appropriately to their emotions. These robots used both sensors and artificial intelligence to create such a real impression. In fact, so genuine was the appearance that owners in Japan were holding funerals when their pets “died.” While this original design was for fun and companion purposes, there seems to be an opportunity to create robotic dogs to replace some of the service animals we have today. Japanese company NSK created Lightbot, a guide robot of sorts, but the design leaves much to be desired when compared to a snuggly pup! Alternatively, robotic dogs or cats could be an ideal solution for families with severe allergies that are prohibitive to real animals. MiRo is a programmable robotic canine created by Consequential Robotics that has sensors for detecting its surroundings, facial recognition technology and is designed to be emotionally engaging. MiRo won the Best Demonstration Award at the 2017 Human-Robot Interaction conference in Vienna, Austria. CHiP, made by WowWee, is an intelligent, affectionate robot dog. Using smart technology and advanced sensors, your responses will determine CHiP’s behavior. Cozmo is yet another example. There is also a robotic company that designs robots resembling animal-like frames called Boston Dynamics. Though these robots are intended less for companion purposes and more for practical applications, they are designed to learn and adapt to their environment. Once you watch a video of their robot, Spot, it’s hard not to imagine how it could easily segue into the pet world with just a little “prettying” up. 3. Drones for lost doggies There are some practical applications for drones in the pet industry. For one, a drone is capable of searching and finding missing pets. They are able to cover a wider area than a human could and, when combined with other technologies such as the GPS wearables discussed below, could zoom in on the lost animal. Drones have already been used to track and count strays in urban areas such as Houston, Texas. The World Animal Awareness Society used drones to film strays to increase awareness and compassion for the issue. A few months ago, IBM filed a patent for a drone that could act as a pet sitter or trainer, providing your dog or cat with constant monitoring while you’re away at work. It could train your pet or provide entertainment should your dog get restless or lonely. Potentially, the drone could allow the dog in or out, and also dole out food or treats at mealtimes or for training purposes. Netherlands-based Tinki.nl thinks the 100 million kilos of dog droppings that are neglectfully distributed in his country create quite the nightmare. Teaming up with Space53, the companies use a drone equipped with thermal imaging and recognition software to locate the mess and apply GPS coordinates to its location. Then, a robot receives the coordinates and cleans the area. It's an incredible way to combine technologies to address a real problem. 4. Sensors for Spot Sensors for pets, particularly in the form of wearables such as GPS-enabled collars, have seen significant growth over the last few years. WonderWoof BowTie is a dog activity tracker that can set daily recommended activity targets for your pet based on size, breed and age. It records movement and sends owners progress reports (or reminders to get the dog to be more active!) via an app. The Buddy by Squeaker glow-in-the-dark LED collar takes this a step further, using GPS and Bluetooth technology to track and organize daily activity. Not only does it use geofencing and real-time tracking, but it will also determine your dog’s temperature and set the thermostat in your home to make your pet more comfortable. It is waterproof and connects to your smartphone for real-time health analysis and updates. PetPace, designed for dogs or cats, monitors health and alerts owners when something is wrong. Other examples of health monitoring devices include the iotatracker, FitBark and Tailio for cats. What about fish? FishBit monitors your aquarium, including temperature and fish/coral/plant stock, and it reminds you when the water needs to be changed, all through an app on your smartphone. Wearables offering GPS monitoring include PawTrack, specifically for cats, Whistle for dogs and Tractive for both dogs and cats. Petkit not only offers a wearable that monitors activity and food intake, but also assesses an animal’s mood, and so does DogStart’s TailTalk. PawTracker is also designed for both dogs and cats and uses GPS locating to keep track of your pet. However, sensors go beyond wearables. Tired of scooping kitty litter? Litter-Robot has a space-age-looking enclosed litter “box” that senses when your cat is done and cleans the box for you. It also alerts you when the box is full so all you have to do is dump the drawer. Perhaps the most practical opportunity for sensor technology is in automatic feeders. PetNet makes an automatic feeder that gauges the amount of existing food and reorders more if levels run low. CatFi does much the same, and also uses 3D facial recognition to track how much each individual cat is eating. Designed by animal-loving neurosurgeons, CleverPet is an automatic feeding system that is also designed to engage and challenge your pet to ease boredom. OurPets Wonder Bowl is paired with a collar tag that allows only the animal it is connected with to eat, which is great for people with more than one pet or animals on special diets. Eyenimal offers a wide range of products, from invisible fencing to no-bark collars, cameras and automatic feeding devices. PetSafe offers all manner of pet products, including food dispensers, automatic ball launchers, electronic pet doors, laser toys for cats and more. There is no shortage of variety of sensor applications. Most of these are wearables in the form of collars, some are feeders or toys. Almost all will connect to your smartphone, where appropriate.

Voyce Sensor tracks activity, heart and respiratory rates, quality of rest, etc. 5. Using artificial intelligence (AI) to talk to your pet No need for your pet to be bored while you’re away — AI can be used to entertain, challenge and even reward him. Image courtesy of Petcube. The next step in AI might be talking to and understanding your pet! Not long ago, Amazon said it would be selling pet translators within the next 10 years. Already, there is an app available in the U.K. that is a “human-to-cat translator,” but it does not necessarily claim to use AI and reviews are mixed as to its effectiveness. As already mentioned, robotic dogs can use AI, and sensors provide a means of collecting information for AI to make real-time decisions. PetBot uses AI to recognize your dog, give it treats when you choose (through an app) and take pictures that are sent to your smartphone. Felik is an intelligent pet companion that uses AI to create the same movements a human does when using a laser pointer to play with a cat or dog, keeping your pet entertained while you’re away. Petchatz also allows owners to chat with their dog and release treats to reward their attentiveness. 6. Create your own pet through augmented reality Augmented reality, sometimes referred to as “mixed reality,” offers its own version of what the future of household pets might be. Rather than robots, what about holograms? This is just one of the many applications of Microsoft’s HoloLens using Actiongram. These holographic pets are able to interact with their owners and fetch balls, perform tricks for treats and even display personalities and emotions like shyness and happiness. These digital companions will build intelligence and learn to interact with people. British company INDE has created all types of AR systems for many top organizations, including an interactive dinosaur display for National Geographic. Who’s to say what other AR companies may move into the pet industry? 7. Virtual reality allows for much cleaner “pet” homes This imploring face may be created in a virtual world, but it still demands love and attention. Image courtesy of Foopets. VR technology is proving to be an effective training tool, including within veterinary education. Future animal surgeons can learn extensively from this technology in the classroom, but there are other, less serious functions for the technology as well. Google Cardboard has made it easy for anyone to use VR apps such as Virtual Reality Pet. HTC Vive, the creator of Konrad the Kitten, has really upped its game recently with a new design using Oculus Rift’s handheld touch controller, which allows users to not only see a virtual pet, but to physically touch, pet, hold or cuddle one. FooPets offers both puppies and kittens as adoptable virtual pets that require food, love and attention. Reading about VR in the pet industry almost begs the question: Will pets experience VR as well? Pawculus Rift was a pretty good April fools’ joke by Cramer, but who’s to say that one day there couldn’t be a use for it? Could VR for your pet keep them entertained while you’re at work? Could it be used to train them? As quickly as technology is moving, new opportunities arise every day, and it may not seem so strange to imagine. 8. Blockchain could verify your pet’s pedigree Undoubtedly, blockchain technology has the capability to revolutionize transparency in pet pedigrees. Privacy is always a concern within a series of transactions, such as the sale of a pet through multiple owners, but blockchain is designed in such a way that the digital records are not centrally located, nor controlled by one entity. No one can manipulate the data, and it is fully secure. This leaves it virtually impregnable to hackers or information seekers with malintent. The biggest benefit of blockchain is the ability to share all types of information. From an animal’s breeding history to its yearly veterinary care, health records, dog show awards, training certifications, etc., Blockchain can actually store information from any device, even robots, sensors and microchips. Internet of things (IoT) becomes the internet of pets Any of these eight digital technologies can become part of the IoT. It is IoT technology that interconnects them, even in ways we may not yet comprehend. For example, IoT connects the camera in your living room with the smartphone on your desk, allowing you to monitor your pet while you’re at work. It’s also IoT that connects your phone back to the treat feeder, allowing you to reward your pet for behaving while you’re at work! IoT enables the collection and interconnectivity of data. This is extremely important when considering the health and well-being of your pet. Big data and the microbiome In recent years, discussion has evolved about the role of the microbiome, or the bacteria in your stomach, and the effects a healthy gut can have on humans. The same is true for animals. Studying an animal’s microbiome and the effect nutrients has on it is not easy. Thankfully, there is another new type of technology called nutrigenomics (the study of how nutrients affect an organism’s genes). It uses a gene chip that allows researchers to test different nutrients, such as vitamins, minerals, yeast fractions, probiotics, prebiotics and even essential oils, to see how adding them to an animal’s diet can improve their digestive efficiency. Why is this important? By improving the microbiome, or gut, of your pet, you can improve their overall health. It will reduce their chances of getting sick and improve their energy levels. There are very few nutrigenomics centers in the world, and most are dedicated to human research. Alltech has built the only one dedicated to animals and has collected a tremendous amount of data, challenging traditional analytical systems, but big data algorithms have been developed that allow for this information to be analyzed and understood as never before. The eight technologies, the IoT and the advent of big data described here are digital disruptions affecting nearly every aspect of modern life, including even our four-legged companions. While some of the concepts may seem hard to fathom, given the speed of innovation, concepts that don’t exist today may quickly emerge and become a reality. Advances in the pet industry are already apparent, and new technologies arrive on the market on a daily basis, growing the market ecosystem map. From a commercial standpoint, it’s clear: The pet industry is growing by leaps and bounds, and there are exciting (and profitable!) times ahead for those who cater to people’s love for their companion animal family members. *The framework for these eight technologies was first proposed in a PwC article.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/futuristic-fido-tech-thats-reinventing-pet-world","title":"\n\n                    Futuristic Fido: Tech that's reinventing the pet world\n                    ","date":"September 4, 2017","contentLength":2705}},{"pageContent":"Although it is a fairly new practice, shrimp farming in Brazil shows great potential in both internal and external markets. Currently, the cultivated area of ​​shrimp nurseries in Brazil is 25,000 hectares, but this could eventually expand by 1 million hectares, according to the Brazilian Shrimp Farmers Association (ABCCAM). To maintain their high levels of productivity, producers are betting on natural supplementation as an alternative to improving and preserving their animals’ health, as well as to combat factors like toxicity and adsorption of harmful pathogenic bacteria. Other essential aspects that can affect animal comfort and productivity and that shrimp farmers should consider include water quality control, transparency, dissolved oxygen, nitrogen compounds, alkalinity, hardness and more. “Despite its great potential, the shrimp farming sector in Brazil still struggles with some challenges that hinder its growth,” said Fabio Rodrigues, aquaculture sales coordinator for Alltech Brazil. “Among some of the main obstacles we can name are problems like white spot syndrome.” According to Rodrigues, this disease drastically reduces production and is one reason why, despite its great potential, the Brazilian shrimp industry is currently only capable of serving its domestic market. The virus that causes this disease can destroy organ cells in the shrimp digestive and respiratory systems. In this scenario, the use of select additives can optimize the shrimp’s reproductive cycle, allowing for better productivity. “These solutions can provide better immunity and anti-inflammatory effects and a better shell quality,” said Rodrigues. “Other solutions for shrimp farms include utilizing enriched products based on fermented meal for fertilization, supplementation or as a complement to the diet.” The solution Alltech offers solutions for the feed industry and for shrimp producers that optimize the nutrition of crustaceans and help achieve a more efficient production. One example is Aquate, which supports shrimp development and reflects a more attractive cost-benefit to the producer.

In just a few short months, these youngsters will have grown significantly, and it will be time for them to leave their mothers — and their mothers’ milk supplies — behind. Not surprisingly, this can be an incredibly stressful time for both parties, but it doesn’t have to be so bad. Here are five suggestions for reducing weaning-related upset: 1. Introduce creep feeding: By the time a foal is two to three months old, its mother’s milk production is often starting to decrease, no longer fulfilling the foal’s nutritional needs. Creep feeding with a fortified feed designed specifically for young, growing horses can ensure that these nutritional needs are being met. In addition, it helps prospective weanlings get used to eating grain, providing for a less stressful feeding experience once they are separated from their mothers. You should also be providing free access to good-quality forage and fresh, clean water during this time. 2. Plan ahead: Decide which method you are going to use for weaning — abrupt or gradual — and then formulate a strategy for when and how you are going to execute this process. Some prefer abrupt weaning in order to get the experience over with quickly, but, if possible, a gradual method through group pasture weaning is considered the least stressful option. This works best when there are multiple pairs to be weaned and horses have been turned out together long enough to form a bond. Determine which foal will be weaned first and remove its mother, taking her to a distant paddock out of sight and earshot (off-property if necessary), while her foal remains in a comfortable setting with friends. Over the next few weeks, the other mares will gradually be taken to join the other newly-weaned mothers until all foals are successfully weaned. Both mares and foals get to stay with horses they know, thereby reducing any related trauma. 3. Give your foal some company: Horses are herd animals who thrive on the company of others. Proper socialization is critical to a young horse’s development. As mentioned above, if you have more than one foal, you can turn mares and foals out together prior to removing the mares so they can grow accustomed to one another. However, owners with just one broodmare may wonder how to approach finding a suitable companion. Suggested options include a quiet gelding, a retired pony or even a donkey who can effectively serve as a nanny. Older mares who have previously had foals are often good companions for single foals because they can help teach them acceptable horse manners. 4. Provide lots of human interaction: Weaning is a great opportunity to build trust with a young horse simply by providing companionship. It is also an ideal time to halter break and extensively handle foals. Visit weanlings often to build a rapport and introduce the halter and lead slowly. Whether or not you consider yourself a trainer, you should remember that you are effectively training your young horse to be properly handled and teaching them what is considered appropriate behavior. Do your best to make these interactions positive. 5. Practice safety first: Despite your best efforts, mother and offspring may still panic a bit at the prospect of being separated. Prior to weaning, check fences and the general environment of the area where the mare(s) and foal(s) will be moving. Remove anything that could potentially cause injuries and, if necessary, repair fencing. Don’t combine weaning with other stressful situations, such as visits from the farrier or vet, vaccinations, extreme weather or an introduction to a new turnout group. Make sure your schedule will allow enough time for you to check mares and foals often, especially in the first couple of days. It is also recommended that, at least for a time, you monitor body temperatures daily, since stress can weaken a foal’s immunity.

But, before you send Fido packing, know that you have a plethora of options available to combat these would-be invaders. First, let’s consider what we may commonly be up against: Ectoparasites: These are perhaps some of the most well-known insects associated with dogs. These pests prefer to live on or just under the surface of your dog’s skin and can easily be picked up on outdoor adventures and introduced to your home. Fleas: Dogs typically get fleas from other animals. Fleas are notoriously challenging to see with the naked eye, but their bites can cause severe irritation and inflammation. Your dog will undoubtedly be scratching and biting at their skin almost incessantly if infected. Ticks: Ticks can easily be picked up in tall grass and wooded areas. More than just disgusting bloodsuckers, infected ticks can transmit Lyme disease, a serious bacterial illness that can also be passed on to humans. Mites: Just as with people, mites exist naturally on dogs, but if found in excessive quantities, they can cause serious skin problems. Ear mites are another common concern. They are highly contagious and are typically passed from outdoor cats to canines, though humans are generally immune. Excessive head shaking and scratching at ears/the head are usually dead giveaways. Internal parasites: Dogs can contract internal parasites from a variety of situations, but they are typically transmitted when an animal unintentionally ingests parasite eggs in contaminated soil, water, food or feces. Heartworms: One bite from an infected mosquito can lead to an unprotected dog developing heartworm disease, by far one of the most preventable and potentially deadly infections. Tapeworms: There are several types of tapeworm, but the most common is caused by swallowing an infected flea. They typically set up shop in your dog’s small intestine, where they continue to feed and grow. Tapeworms compromise your pet’s nutrition and can contribute to weight loss, lethargy and a variety of other issues. Hookworms: These nasty intestinal parasites can be ingested by sniffing or eating contaminated soil or feces. Hookworms literally hook themselves into the lining of your dog’s intestines and leave holes in their wake, potentially leading to anemia, weakness, weight loss and death. Of course, these are just a few examples of the many possible pests that might afflict your canine companion. So, what’s a concerned dog mom or dad to do? An ounce of prevention First and foremost, let’s remember that we are our dogs’ biggest advocates. It is up to us to ensure that they have a clean, safe environment to thrive in. And, as responsible owners, we should all be taking the following recommended actions: Feed a chewable heartworm preventative, year-round, as prescribed by your veterinarian. It is a cheap and highly effective way to prevent disease. Flea and tick preventatives abound. You may choose from chewables, collars and topicals. Choose what works best for your dog and your lifestyle, as recommended by your veterinarian. Brush and bathe your dog regularly. This will not only allow for some quality bonding time, but it will also allow you to address any potential skin issues. Schedule time to regularly clean up your yard. Keeping it relatively free of feces and overgrowth will go a long way in keeping your pet healthy. Always check your dog’s skin (and yours, too!) after spending time in heavily wooded areas. If you should happen to find an embedded tick, take care in removing it. There are many affordable tick removal tools on the market today. Building a defense Another thing to consider is your nutrition regimen and what role it might play in immune defense, especially against would-be pathogenic or viral invaders. Much like us, dogs have a natural immunity that they have built up over the course of their life, but, unfortunately, that’s not always enough to prevent harm or illness. One thing you can do to help support your dog’s immunity is feed a high-quality diet containing trace minerals such as organic selenium (think Sel-Plex®). Selenium can help to maintain proper function and strength of the immune system and counteract oxidative damage caused by infections. As the late, great Benjamin Franklin so wisely proclaimed in 1736, “An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” Nearly 300 years later, this advice still rings true.

Histostat was very effective at controlling the disease in chickens and turkeys, and after its removal, the industry has experienced a significant increase in cases of blackhead disease. What is blackhead disease (histomoniasis)? How does histomoniasis get in the broiler or turkey house? How can it be controlled moving forward? These are some of the questions that Dr. Dennis Wages, professor of poultry health management at the College of Veterinary Medicine at North Carolina State University, explored in the webinar “Blackhead control: past and present.” “Diseases that have historical significance tend to reemerge,” said Wages when opening the webinar. “The main reason we are talking about it (blackhead disease) today is because the preventative and therapeutic agents that were used to control blackhead have been removed.” In the webinar, Wages covered: How the disease is transmitted in chickens and turkeys. The intermediate hosts and mechanical vectors. The key points of control. Nutritional strategies and feed additives to control the disease. Wages concluded by emphasizing that there is a wide range of factors that need to be addressed in order to help minimize the exposure to histomoniasis. Only by having a management plan that touches all those factors will producers be able to control this disease.

Some will be beloved trail companions or elite show champions, while others may have a successful winning edge on the racetrack. But all good things must come to an end, right? Not necessarily. Cloning, the controversial practice that first came to our attention with the birth of Dolly, a female domestic sheep, in July of 1996, is making it possible to have a genetic replica of your favorite four-legged friend — be it a horse, dog or a whole host of other species. But it’ll cost you, and success isn’t necessarily ensured. Still, if you find yourself curious about the process, here are five things you should know: 1. Break open your piggy bank: Producing a genetic twin of a horse can cost more than $150,000. That may sound like a lot of money to some, but horses are big business for others, and the opportunity to protect and multiply the genetics of superior animals makes cloning a valuable option for many owners and breeders. 2. The same, but also different: While the DNA of the cloned horse will exactly match that of the donor, the genetics could be expressed differently than they were in the original animal. We often discuss gene expression as it applies to nutrigenomics research at Alltech. Despite all cells containing a complete genetic code, only a fraction of these genes are expressed — or “switched on” — depending on cell type, availability of nutrients, bioactive compounds and other stimuli. 3. No guarantees: Just like two famous Michaels — Jordan and Phelps — weren’t born knowing how to dribble a basketball or swim, horses are also products of their environment. Sure, natural talent and ability are helpful, but nutrition, management, handling and training also play a vital role. Just because the original horse was a champion doesn’t mean the cloned horse will be, too. 4. Just because you can…: Should you? Controversy still surrounds this process. Many don’t feel it’s right to mess with Mother Nature and risk future problems with genetic mutations or bottlenecks that may occur as a result of breeding a specific line. And some breed organizations, including the Jockey Club and the American Quarter Horse Association, oppose the process and will not accept cloned horses or their progeny into their registries. 5. The bigger picture: Cloning has a wider value in animal reproduction, especially in the preservation of threatened species. Dr. Katrin Hinrichs, professor and Patsy Link Chair of mare reproductive studies at Texas A&M University, offers some insight: “The main justification I see for cloning is to preserve genetics, as in valuable geldings or in the case of rare or endangered species or breeds, so that you can expand the gene pool. You could use cells from animals that died decades ago (if the cells were recovered before or at death and frozen) that are under-represented in the population today.”1 Still not convinced you’d want to take the leap and recreate your furry friend, even if money was no object? Neither am I. Nevertheless, whether you agree with the practice of cloning or find it entirely objectionable, I hope you’ve learned as much as I have from this brief glance. 1 Evans, M. (2016).

The images of ruptured grain bins and flooded grain show only a portion of the destruction caused by this disastrous event. Grain that has been subjected to flood damage is considered contaminated for food and feed use. Grain that was stored in the same facility but did not come in contact with floodwaters can be utilized as normal, but precautions should be taken. Grain from the upper portion of the bin must be removed from the side or the top; due to potential contamination, it cannot be removed through the bottom of the bin. Make sure the electricity is disconnected, as there will be a greater risk of potential shorts and damaged electric motors. Once removed, grain can be handled in various ways, including flat storing and bins. Flat-stored corn should be closely monitored for temperature and moisture, as moist grain can sometimes flare up in “hot spots” and warm temperatures. When the temperature inside the grain pile reaches 150° F, the grain begins to compost, so it should be mixed or stirred. If the temperature reaches 170° F, the grain may begin to smolder and has the potential to catch fire. Monitor pile temperatures with deep probes or by driving pointed pipes into the pile, followed by lowering in a thermometer. Since this grain could be subjected to rainfall, it is important to continue monitoring it until the grain can be moved or covered. Grain that is moved to bins will also need to be monitored. Aim for the recommended grain moisture level of 14 percent moisture for storage. Some producers utilize standard natural air bin drying systems with perforated floors and high-capacity fans. Supplemental heat can also help speed up drying time, but take caution not to raise the air temperature more than 10°–15°F. Along with moisture, grain must also be monitored for mold and mycotoxins. Molds may or may not be visible and, as such, the grain should be analyzed. Mold can produce mycotoxins that impair animal performance and health while also reducing the grain’s nutritional value by lowering its energy level. Propionic acid can help control and maintain mold levels in stored grains, but application rates will vary based on the grain’s moisture level and the percent of propionic acid used in the product. If it has not been contaminated by floodwaters, grain from flood-damaged facilities can be salvaged and properly removed, monitored for health and moisture in a new storage facility, and analyzed for mold and mycotoxins. The recent flooding speaks to a larger concern for grain producers in the Midwest, where some areas experienced the wettest 12 months (April 2018 to April 2019) in 127 years. Overall, corn planting in the United States is 6 percent behind the five-year average — but some Midwestern states are even further behind than that. Of the top 18 corn-producing states, five had not begun planting by April 21. Topsoil moisture is at a 29 percent surplus for the entire U.S., with subsoil at a 26 percent surplus. A wet, delayed spring planting can put crops in jeopardy of pollinating and maturing in a more challenging environment. These trials could also subject the plant to mold and mycotoxin infestation.

Stress causes our cortisol levels to rise. Cortisol can cause food cravings, usually for high carbohydrate or sweet foods. Not only do many people turn to food as a comfort during stressful times, they also tend to consume more highly refined carbohydrates like white pasta, bread, rice, bagels, chips, crackers, baked goods and other sweets. Although these foods may provide quick and immediate comfort, the more of them we eat, the worse our mood gets. High intake of these foods leads to crashes that may increase susceptibility to new stress. After a spike in blood sugar caused by eating a large amount of highly refined carbohydrates, it’s common to experience mental fog, tiredness, anxiety and irritability, all of which may exacerbate existing stress. Cortisol also activates an enzyme in our fat cells. Visceral fat cells – the fat found around vital organs in our abdomen – have significantly more of these enzymes than subcutaneous fat – the fat just below the skin on other areas of the body like legs and buttocks – which is why stress causes belly fat accumulation. The more stress a person has, the more abdominal obesity can occur, which is linked to a greater risk for heart disease and diabetes. Luckily, there are other components of food that can help regulate stress by providing specific nutrients or sustained energy. Better mood foods DHA omega-3 This essential fatty acid has been studied for its positive effects on mood and protection of our brain against chronic stress. Increasing dietary intake of DHA omega-3 may help prevent the harmful effects of chronic stress and the development of stress-related disorders such as depression and anxiety. Better Mood Foods: DHA-enriched eggs, meat and milk, salmon, mackerel and sardines Zinc Diets low in zinc have been linked to anxiety and depression. A daily intake is required, as our body doesn’t have a zinc storage system. Better Mood Foods: oysters, beef, crab, lobster, chicken, turkey, beans and nuts Magnesium This mineral has been called “the original chill pill” for its role in regulating cortisol levels and its ability to prevent the entrance of stress hormones to the brain. Better Mood Foods: spinach, whole grains, legumes, potatoes, avocados, nuts and seeds Vitamin B6 An important function of vitamin B6 is helping to produce serotonin and norephinephrine, both of which positively influence mood. Better Mood Foods: chickpeas, tuna, salmon, chicken and turkey Whole grains Both simple (white bread and pasta, bagels, baked goods, etc.) and complex (whole grain bread and pasta, oatmeal, etc.) carbohydrates are turned into glucose, a type of sugar used as fuel by the body. However, complex carbohydrates contain vitamins, minerals and fiber that slow the release of glucose into the blood stream, providing the body a steady supply of energy, as well as serotonin, a “feel good” chemical. Better Mood Foods: oatmeal, brown rice, whole grain bread and pasta, quinoa and popcorn","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/food-and-mood","title":"\n\n                    Food and Mood\n                    ","date":"April 6, 2017","contentLength":496}},{"pageContent":"Amidst his days of sketching ideas for bicycles, parachutes, tanks and submarines, Leonardo da Vinci, a Renaissance genius, ran into obstacles. Nevertheless, da Vinci was well-known for keeping a notebook of his ideas and thoughts, scribbled randomly in the pages. Among these pages lived an affirmation da Vinci repeated during times of innovative struggles: “Obstacles do not bend me.” Over 500 years later, Dr. Mark Lyons, president of Alltech, took the stage at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference. In front of nearly 4,000 people, he told the audience about another genius who was known for documenting all his thoughts in a notebook. Dr. Pearse Lyons, Mark’s late father and founder of Alltech, was a champion of sustainability, brewing, nutrition and innovation. He, too, had an affirmation for when struggles arose: “We will bend reality.” “If you think it, ink it!” Mark told the crowd. Yet documenting ideas in a notebook isn’t the only similarity that da Vinci and Dr. Lyons shared. According to the book “How to Think Like Leonardo da Vinci” by Michael Gelb, there are seven steps to becoming a genius like da Vinci. Mark explored the seven different ways his father compared to the visionary: 1. Curiosity: Da Vinci was eager to ask “what if” questions: What if humans could fly like birds? What if art could transform the world? Dr. Lyons was known for questioning the status quo, too. Those who knew him were aware of his hard-hitting questions: What if we could reduce animal pollution? What if we could feed animals more naturally? What if we could connect farmers with technology? 2. Demonstration: The ability to learn from his mistakes was an admirable trait of da Vinci’s. Part of innovation, part of building an empire, is testing knowledge through experience. “He didn’t believe he was any better than anyone else,” said Mark of his father. “He didn’t believe he was completely unique. He was humble.” 3. Sensation: In an age when technology lives at our finger tips, what would da Vinci, a supporter of using all five senses, think about people glued to their phones? Dr. Lyons invested much time and effort into his two homelands, Kentucky and Ireland, by hosting worldwide events and building beautiful distilleries. This commitment to his communities helps encourage people to get off their phones and into the world. 4. Smoke: A willingness to embrace uncertainty. Da Vinci, a genius, recognized that there were still topics unknown to him. However, the excitement to learn something new is an important step on the road to genius. Dr. Lyons was known for cultivating a spirit of curiosity within himself and within others by funding graduate programs, conferences and language classes for his employees. “Learning never exhausts the mind,” da Vinci once said. 5. Art/science: Often, people describe themselves as “right-brained” or “left-brained” — art-driven or science-driven. However, to achieve the genius of da Vinci, it’s important to find a balance between the two. Da Vinci was an artist, yes, but he was also an engineer, a botanist and an inventor. Dr. Lyons was a scientist who was gifted in fermentation, but he also was a man with a highly developed palate and a creative mind that crafted award-winning beer. The key is balance. 6. The body: “Your mind follows your physical state,” da Vinci said. Da Vinci and Dr. Lyons were firm believers that an alert body leads to an alert mind, which is why Dr. Lyons went running each morning and even hosted runs at Alltech’s annual international conference. He clearly recognized the importance of happy, healthy employees. 7. Connection: Da Vinci connected to the world, to his environment, to his art. However, Mark emphasized that Dr. Lyons was more interested in connecting with people. “He constantly wanted to connect and bring people together,” explained Mark. The similarities between Leonardo da Vinci and Dr. Pearse Lyons are striking. However, there is an overall theme between the two men: a sense of purpose. For da Vinci, a purpose to create. For Dr. Lyons, a purpose to sustain the world. “Today, people will work for purposeful companies and purposeful institutions,” said Mark. “And if you don’t have a purpose, they won’t work for you at all.” Ultimately, these two geniuses have set the standard high. Perhaps not everyone can be a da Vinci or a Dr. Lyons, but these steps can lead us to find our own ONE big idea. “We cannot replace Dr. Lyons, nobody can,” Mark told the crowd. “But if we start to think like him, if we can get 10 people, 100 people, 1,000 people thinking like him, imagine what we can achieve together.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/da-vinci-and-dr-pearse-lyons-geniuses-renaissance-and-ag-tech","title":"\n\n                    Da Vinci and Dr. Pearse Lyons: Geniuses of Renaissance and ag-tech\n                    ","date":"May 21, 2018","contentLength":793}},{"pageContent":"The frenzy for all things blockchain is exemplified by the Long Island iced tea company whose stock increased six times overnight when it simply changed its name to include the word “blockchain.” Even the Chinese stock market is seeing a boom in anything blockchain-related.

Blockchain and agriculture: A new tool for an old system Knowing what you are buying has been problematic for as long as people have been trading along the food supply chain (the earliest examples of writing are agricultural transaction records from Sumeria, from approximately 3000 BC). As the food supply chain is global, a network with real traceability is essential in order for people to be able to trust what they are buying. Enter blockchain. Blockchain is an effective way to balance the need for confidentiality with the need for transparency. A blockchain-based supply chain should result in food that is safe and traceable while reducing waste and creating economic benefits for all of the stakeholders in the food supply chain. Of particular benefit to the agricultural sector are lower costs and added value (Rabobank). Lower costs are achieved through greater efficiency, lower transaction costs and better access to information. Because the information provided through the blockchain is reliable, documents and certificates can be trusted and many back-office processes can be automated. As the need for manual or repeated verification decreases, lead times can be shorter and turnaround faster. The security of the system means that payments can be executed quickly and safely, eliminating the need for third-party payment processing. Moreover, the visibility of the blockchain improves pricing transparency, particularly for smaller agribusinesses and farmers in regions that have not previously had access to global pricing. Logistically, blockchain can speed up the movement of food through the supply chain network (critical for perishable goods) and also allows fast, targeted removal of products that are not fit for consumption. Both ways, food waste is reduced. Faster analysis and interpretation of consumer desires (such is the goal of INS Ecosystem) can further reduce errors and waste, and the greater transparency of the chain allows for better forecasting. Accuracy is improved by reducing the places where human error can enter the system. This is not to say that blockchain technology is entirely immune to error. The information contained within the network, while incorruptible once documented, could be entered incorrectly or fraudulently. What blockchain offers is a means to identify the error or fraudulent entry. Furthermore, the blockchain should contain all members of the supply chain. If a piece is missing, its transparency and traceability are lacking; the ideal blockchain starts at seed or feed and follows all the way to consumer purchase. Potential for added value comes from better access to information about pricing, markets and products. Analysis of up-to-date, reliable data will help identify new opportunities regionally or globally and enable adaptation of supply chains to better fit consumer needs. With greater transparency and more reliable data, better and more targeted financing options can be developed. And, with the cooperation of governments, greater regulatory harmonization can improve efficiencies throughout the agriculture sector. Many of these current and potential benefits of blockchain can be seen in a single example: the spinach crisis of 2006. On Sept. 14, 2006, based on complaints from 19 states, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration advised consumers not to eat bagged fresh spinach. It took two weeks for the region that the spinach came from to be identified, and it was not until Oct. 12, with five people dead and 200 sickened, that the specific source of contamination was identified. In the meantime, all fresh spinach and fresh spinach products were cleared from shops across the U.S., with an overall cost of more than $175 million. Contrast that with a recent blockchain-based supply chain trial between Walmart and IBM in which a food was traced back through each party involved all the way back to its origins in seconds (2.2, to be exact). At any point in the chain, all other possible cross-contaminations could be identified. The location of any contaminated food could be traced and pulled from shelves or dealt with immediately, protecting consumers, reducing waste and protecting the producers along the way from unnecessary losses. China has also recognized the advantages of blockchain for food safety and through the Food Safety Alliance for China is supporting a joint undertaking between Tsinghua University, Walmart and a consortium of large food companies (Dole, Driscoll’s, Golden State Foods, Kroger, McCormick & Company, McLane Company, Nestlé, Tyson Foods, Unilever and IBM) to create a food tracking system using blockchain. Blockchain in practice While blockchain is still a relatively new concept, early adopters can already be found throughout agriculture, including the poultry, dairy, beef, aqua and crop sectors. The most common applications are simply confirmation of the source of a product (as with Honeysuckle Thanksgiving turkeys, where you can enter a code on the company’s website and immediately know what farm the bird originated from), but blockchain is also being used to ensure availability of production data, prevent food fraud, provide payment security, ensure regulatory compliance and provide safe access to markets for small and remote farmers. Production information There are now several companies offering blockchain-based supply chains for agribusiness, but OriginTrail was the pioneer. Starting in 2013 with a beta test for the beef sector, it has since added dairy, poultry and vegetable supply chains. Another example in poultry is producer Perutnina Ptuj, which provides customers with complete information on the origins of the meat they purchase through a smartphone app. Even vegetables can be traced back to their origins: Slovenia-based Natureta uses a blockchain platform to give customers access to food procurement information and can instantly show in which garden food they are currently cooking with was grown. Another blockchain platform is Provenance, a U.K.-based company that is currently working with more than 200 food businesses, tracking food (including produce) from point of origin all the way to the supermarket, documenting each step in the process and allowing food companies to prove their product claims and guarantees. It has partnered with Arkansas-based Grass Roots Farmers’ Cooperative to allow customers to track their food, including information on meat quality and origin, how the animal was raised and any other companies involved in the process through the use of QR codes. Provenance has also reached into the aquaculture industry to run a pilot program designed to track the production of yellowfin and skipjack tuna in the Southeast Asian fishing industry. Through text messages, fishermen have been helping nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) track the process from initial registration of the caught fish and data verification all the way to the consumer, ensuring fish have been sourced in a socially and environmentally sound manner. Other food or agribusiness blockchain supply chain platforms include: Carrefour: Announced intentions to launch Europe’s first food blockchain. A QR code scan will tell consumers where the bird was reared, the name of the farmer, what feed the bird consumed, quality labels and where the bird was slaughtered. The initial focus will be on its line of free-range Auvergne chickens, but the plan is to expand the technology to at least eight other products before year end 2018. JD.com: Beef industry platform in China that can trace beef purchased in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to its original production location in Inner Mongolia. FoodLogiQ: Starting as a Canadian beef platform, FoodLogiQ is now a full farm-to-fork system, with an emphasis on supplier management, food safety compliance, quality incident management, recall management and whole chain traceability. Ripe.io : Started by former financiers, Ripe uses algorithms to calculate sustainability scores, as well as scores for spoilage and safety levels. Bext360: A Ugandan Great Lakes Coffee exporter and a Denver-based coffee roaster, Coda Coffee, are creating a “bean to brew” blockchain. A similar platform by Moyee Coffee tracks their beans from Ethiopia to Amsterdam program will trace the coffee from Moyee Coffee in Ethiopia to Amsterdam, tracking payments to the farmers along the way. Starbucks is also investigating the technology to promote ethical sourcing and connect customers to bean growers. DNVGL: Its application, known as My Story, verifies Italian wine growers’ supply chains, from seed to bottle. OriginTrail: In combination with TagItSmart sensors, OriginTrail has a pilot project designed to maintain data integrity in the beverage industry. Wine producer Plantaže will be able to track more than 15,000 bottles of wine. ZhongAn Technology (a subsidiary of an insurance company): Its blockchain system for the free-range chicken sector in China intends to alleviate both poverty among chicken farmers and consumer food safety concerns. Individual chickens are tagged, and information about each individual chicken’s growth, location, food and even movement is uploaded and available for consumers to trace. Currently, the program collects data from over 200 chicken farms with plans to expand to 2,500 farms by 2020. Coca-Cola and the U.S. State Department are initiating a project using blockchain to combat the forced labor market by creating a secure registry for workers. Anti-counterfeiting/adulteration The ability to track the provenance of products is a key benefit in many ag sectors. For example, large commercial dairy companies have a challenge tracking the provenance of their milk as they often source from multiple milk producers. Slovenian dairy brand Zelene Doline is tracking its products and connecting the more than 1,000 Slovenian dairy farms that provide milk to the company. The traceability system allows consumers to log onto the company’s website, enter the product’s European Article Number barcode and “best before” date to gain information on the product’s origins. Russia’s dairy industry is also incorporating blockchain to combat counterfeit dairy products. According to researchers, Russia produces 40 percent less milk than the amount sold, and there is speculation that vegetable fats or palm oils are being used to dilute the milk for consumer sale, compromising its authenticity. Blockchain provides an objective mechanism to ensure that what is sold as milk is actually milk. Similarly, Ambrosus, a Swiss firm, uses sensors and blockchain technology to provide real-time food supply chain audits, particularly with its cheese and chocolate, to ensure its high-quality products sold in China are not counterfeit. Food fraud is a particular focus of Ireland’s arc-net blockchain platform, which uses unique universal identification codes (UUIDs) through digital DNA to offer a cloud-based platform and traceability to the food and animal feed industries. Transaction and payment security BeefLedger out of Australia has created a secure payment platform using blockchain and cryptocurrency wallets. Its focus is on the rapidly growing Asian middle class, for whom Australian beef is in high demand. Customers are provided with provenance data on meat purchases, including origin and characteristics, while the producers gain access to customer data and feedback. Other examples include: AgriDigital, an Australian blockchain system designed to manage grain trading transactions, finance and connections. Bart.Digital, a Brazilian-based company working with small farmers to provide secure financial documentation. AgrolifeCoin (funded by Agrolife, investors and agribusiness supporters), which provides technical assistance to financial institutions, particularly in developing countries, to enable them to better fund their local agriculture sector. Its global payment network provides peer-to-peer instant transactional opportunities for members of the agricultural community at near-zero cost through its cryptocurrency program Avenews-GT, a global trading company designed to connect buyers and sellers to create transparency, trust and financial security in supply chains. Regulatory compliance Due to its remote nature, the seafood and aquaculture industry has unique monitoring challenges. Mistreatment of workers, mislabeling of fish and destructive fishing methods are increasingly unacceptable to consumers. A collaboration between Earth Twine (which focuses on regulatory compliance in the seafood industry) and Stratis (a blockchain technology company) has led to The Earth Twine-Stratis Platform, a seafood tracking solution platform to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. In parallel, ConsenSys has teamed up with the World Wildlife Fund and TraSeable (a communications technology implementation company) to end human rights abuses in the Pacific Islands’ fishing industry. Working with the tuna fishing and processing company Sea Quest Fiji, the goal is that every can of tuna will have a QR code for consumers to verify that the tuna was sourced in an ethical and sustainable manner. Access to markets Access to buyers at fair prices with security of payment are some of the challenges that face small farmers in developing markets, yet their success is one of the keys to feeding the 9 billion people who will be living on earth in 2050. AgriLedger works with NGOs to bring a blockchain platform through the Agunity app. The platform enables farmers to receive fairer pricing and have a better connection to markets as well as access to insurance, banking or other financial services. It also allows buyers from other markets to buy from small producers with confidence. FarmShare is designed to connect small farmers with local buyers and is similar to a CSA (community-supported agriculture) model, in which people are able to collect fresh food directly from the farmer, completely cutting out the grocery store. ABC: Agriculture + blockchain = consumer (food) Blockchain is a very powerful tool for everyone in the food production system, from the producers of animal and plant nutrition and supplements through to the end consumer. Research has indicated that the food traceability market will be worth $14 billion by next year and the food-related blockchain companies are growing quickly. It brings visibility, as information is shared and replicated simultaneously, increasing trust, accountability and transparency. It will alter how the agriculture industry functions within itself, as well as with customers, and will support us in feeding 9 billion people. There are, of course, challenges. As with any innovative technology, there are implementation costs, and standards are still evolving. Some overarching authority is necessary to ensure that trust in the system is warranted. Managing the change process will take work. And, as with any supply chain process, the best results come when all of the participants are involved. If we work together to overcome these challenges, we will be able to realize the full benefits of blockchain for food safety and traceability, and the potential it has to improve the transparency and reliability of the food chain, to improve market access and reduce food waste. For a simple demonstration of blockchain technology, watch this short video from the BBC. While focused on the bitcoin concept, it is clear how any data intended to be stored confidentially can be safeguarded in a decentralized ledger system. New technologies, including blockchain, are the focus at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference. Speakers include former General Electric Vice Chair and change agent Beth Comstock, professor Robert Wolcott from the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University and CRISPR expert Dr. Rodolphe Barrangou.

This inability to get away creates challenges for these operations as they attempt to discover ways to stay competitive in a mostly commodity-driven business. If you’re reading this and nodding along in agreement, you are certainly not alone. Alltech’s Chief Innovation Officer Aidan Connolly recently published a blog suggesting that growth in beef demand may be at risk. He recognized low-cost competing meats, environmental concerns and fake meats as a “triple threat” and discussed modern technologies that could potentially address these concerns. He went on to say, “What about the consumer? Can we improve the product — and, thereby, improve the experience — to create more consistent flavors, cooking and dining while also meeting their questions about welfare and the environment?” To some, these questions may seem perfectly straightforward, but to those who work day-in and day-out on their families’ operations, it may not be easy to consider the concerns of a consumer they don’t know. While that farm gate has maintained their herd, their traditions and their way of life, it may have also inadvertently kept farmers from becoming interested in who their customer ultimately is. A 2015 article in the Journal of Extension by Gunn and Loy asked producers in Iowa what opportunities and challenges they recognized for the beef industry and the family businesses therein. They identified eight “mega issues”: Land access Farm transition Production efficiency Marketing Genetics Data management Feedstuffs Animal health As someone who makes a living as both a cattle producer and beef nutrition consultant, it is very easy for me to agree with this list. However, if you take a second look, you will realize there is something missing: a direct recognition of consumer demand. In Connolly’s article, he evaluates eight innovative technologies within the beef industry. Just like Gunn and Loy found to be true, Connolly speculates that, while the clear majority of these technologies help address production and labor efficiencies, they lack innovation when it comes to the consumer. In only two of the cases is the consumer even addressed: blockchain and 3D printing. For beef nutrition providers, the farm gate creates a tremendous dilemma. The research conducted in Iowa paints a clear picture of what our beef-producing clients want — to keep their animals healthy and gaining efficiently, along with finding a way for their children to someday do the same. Making the sale means meeting one or more of these customer wants, limiting our ability to move to consumer-centric products that may or may not have an immediate economic return. One very simple example of this is the palatability component, otherwise known as tenderness. Not only is tenderness relatively easy to identify post-harvest, but it also makes superior genetics readily identifiable. While we know the consumer values tenderness, the industry has never found a way to reward beef that excels in this characteristic. Until there is a full understanding of the value of the consumers’ wants by producers, innovation will slow in areas that build demand for our end product. In addition to understanding this value for consumers, it must subsequently be monetized to create new opportunities for the producer. I will admit that I am slow to accept these points myself. I can’t imagine why we would need to do anything different with beef; it is as perfect as my children in my eyes — but the world is constantly changing. Competition continues to mount and opportunities for young producers are becoming scarcer. However, despite this realization, creating that link to the consumer still seems elusive. True opportunity lies in the hands of producers who are willing to make a dramatic change, betting on the future and potentially sacrificing short-term returns. It requires that they move beyond the farm gate, or at the very least that they be willing to let new ideas come through it. This is extraordinarily challenging, especially with over a century of tradition impacting decision-making in many cases. Allowing ideas to flow in and out of the farm gate will be critical for the long-term future of the beef business — thus securing this way of life for future generations. I would like to learn more about beef-related topics.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/farm-gate-keeping-things-or-out","title":"\n\n                    The farm gate: Keeping things in or out?\n                    ","date":"August 16, 2018","contentLength":731}},{"pageContent":"Dealing with disease in poultry production is challenging. This is, in part, because diseases that affect poultry species tend to find ways to constantly evolve, evading strategies to eradicate them. Genetic mutations, the emergence of new virulent strains, and changes in production practices and regulations on the use of therapeutic products create a scenario wherein producers need to identify innovative ways to deal with familiar challenges. A recent example of the difficulty in dealing with changing diseases is the reemergence of histomoniasis, also known as blackhead disease, in turkeys raised in the U.S. Histomoniasis is caused by a protozoan that can cause lesions in the ceca and liver of poultry. The disease can be very costly because it can make broilers more susceptible to coccidiosis, and it can lead to high mortality rates in turkeys. Turkey producers in the U.S. had considered blackhead disease to be a problem of the past. In the 1940s, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of arsenic-based drugs, which were very effective at preventing and treating blackhead disease. A shakeup occurred in 2011 when the FDA concluded that, based on new research, these drugs could potentially leave traces of inorganic arsenic residue in the livers of chickens. Since inorganic arsenic compounds are highly toxic and harmful to human health, the FDA began phasing out these drugs from poultry production. By December 2015, nitarsone, the last available arsenic-based drug for use in food animals, was removed from the market, leaving producers exposed to blackhead disease for the first time in more than half a century. Producers had become dependent on arsenic-based drugs because very little research on alternative solutions to histomoniasis was conducted. Now that these compounds are no longer available for use, turkey producers are being forced to develop new approaches in order to protect their birds. With the Veterinary Feed Directive policy recently taking effect in the U.S., there are more restrictions being placed on antibiotics used in animal production. While these restrictions have yet to lead to banning preventative antibiotics, such as what was done with nitarsone, we have to consider what could happen if this were to become the case. If necrotic enteritis preventative drugs (e.g., bacitracin, virginiamycin, tylosin) were completely banned, we would have to adjust to a different gut health approach to prevent necrotic enteritis from impacting birds. In a recent webinar for Alltech, Dr. Dennis Wages, professor of poultry health management at North Carolina State University, explained a program that has been helping producers address blackhead disease in this new production era. Wages’ control points include: Building a defense against poultry diseases Management control points: Strong biosecurity protocols on-farm Deworm poultry litter Increase litter depth Vectors control, such as pests and beetles Cleaning and disinfecting equipment and facilities Nutritional control points: Phytogenic compounds Essential oil blends and saponins Organic acids Yeast cell wall nutritional technologies Combinations (plant extracts, essential oils, yeast carbohydrates and organic minerals) The already difficult task of protecting flocks against disease is likely to become increasingly challenging, but producers can stay ahead of the game by being aware of and testing new management and nutritional technologies. Turkey producers in the U.S. learned from their blackhead disease experience, but it is likely that this story will repeat itself in another form in the future if the industry is not prepared. Click on the video below to see our blackhead disease short story and learn how Alltech has been helping turkey producers overcome their challenges.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/poultry-producers-war-room-lessons-disease-preparedness-0","title":"\n\n                    The poultry producer’s war room: Lessons on disease preparedness\n                    ","date":"March 29, 2017","contentLength":591}},{"pageContent":"As planting begins, or continues, across various regions in North America, we should all be preparing to do the one thing that can have a significant impact on making or breaking our crops: scouting. Crop scouting is important for numerous reasons, but most importantly, it gives insight on the next steps you need to take to ensure you get the most out of your crops. Three ways to tell if your crops need a boost: 1. Plant health Overall plant health can be difficult to identify. The main indicators to look for include plant growth uniformity, patches of discoloration across the field and any signs of lodging. If observed, the crop may not be as healthy as it needs to be to thrive. Soil and plant testing can identify nutrient deficiencies and other causes of decreased plant health. 2. Disease pressure There are two key indicators of the level of disease pressure you may be dealing with: the crop’s leaves and the roots. If the leaves are discolored and the bottom ones are beginning to wilt, you may need to speak to your agronomist about what your crop needs to get back on the path to high yields and overall crop quality. After digging up a plant, examine the roots and look for consistent color. Also, if you have been experiencing wet weather conditions, the roots may give off a foul odor. Root rot can be caused by fungi attacking the root system, poor drainage, lack of oxygen to the root system, and phytotoxicity. Treatment will depend on the cause, ranging from the use of fungicides to aeration, but if left untreated, root rot will eventually kill the plant. Increasing nutrient availability to the plants and improving plant health can improve their ability to resist disease pressure. Healthy plants are more likely to reach their full genetic potential of productivity. 3. Soil health Your soil is a great storyteller. If it begins to get too dry, it will begin to crack. If it gets too wet, it turns to muck. When you are out scouting your crops, remember to check your soil. If it is showing the indicators mentioned above, or if it lacks soil structure when you pick it up, you may want to give your agronomist a call. If your crop scouting brings to light any of the issues listed above, ask your local trusted agronomist to thoroughly scout your field. By catching problems early, you may be able to get your crop back on the right track to achieve its full potential.

Any variation in the nutrient composition and digestibility of these forages will therefore directly affect a producer’s ability to meet their dairy cows' nutrient requirements throughout the year. In other words, a good understanding of the nutritive value of your fermented forages will allow you to develop a nutrition program that helps your cows reach their true genetic potential for milk production and health. More nutrients for the cow, more dollars in your pocket Over the last few years, nutritionists and dairy producers have been paying special attention to the nutritive value of fermented forages. It is now widely acknowledged that this nutritional concept can positively impact animal productivity and producer profitability. The performance of the modern dairy cow is highly dependent upon the adequate levels and favorable balances of nutrients in the fermented forages they consume. It is an oversimplification to define the nutritive value of fermented forages purely as the ability to supply the nutrients present in the dry matter to the cow. Before nutrients can reach their target tissue in the cow, the feed must be consumed (feed intake) and the nutrients in the forage must be released and absorbed by the cow (digestion). When it comes to digestion, fermentable forages are a step ahead Many factors influence the nutritive value of fermentable forages, including forage cultivar, stage of maturity at harvest and storage methods. In contrast to non-fermentable forages, the digestion of fermentable forage begins long before it is added to the feed bunk. During normal ensiling processes, some nutrients ferment, releasing molecules that make the crop more palatable and easier to digest. Under these conditions, the nutrients have a better chance of being ingested and absorbed. Practically speaking, this fermentable forage has an optimum nutritive value. In commercial dairy herds, this forage will result in high milk yield and milk components, leading to excellent reproductive performance and good health. Test your forage to see how it measures up Usually, producers and nutritionists send forage samples to a lab in order to obtain information on the nutritional composition of the fermented forages. However, this information can come up short in terms of allowing producers to understand how available these nutrients are to the cow. Fortunately, methods such as Alltech’s In vitro Fermentation Model have been developed to efficiently and quickly determine the nutrient availability in these forages, including the neutral detergent fiber digestibility (NDFD), or the organic matter digestibility. Results from these tests are positively correlated with potential intake. When this information is analyzed as a whole, producers can get a good idea of the nutritive value of their fermented forage. In Ontario and Quebec, a recent survey carried out on 47 fermented forages indicated that over 84 percent of the forage samples collected showed NDFD (at 30 hours in vitro) values below 52 percent, suggesting poor nutritive value. Therefore, it is important not to assume that your forages have a good nutritive value. To assure herd performance, testing is a must. Reviewing the nutritive value of the fermented forages used in any feeding program is essential to help your dairy herd reach its maximum genetic potential and is an integral part of dairy farming profitability.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/milk-money-improving-dairy-production-fermented-forages","title":"\n\n                    Milk money: Improving dairy production with fermented forages\n                    ","date":"October 25, 2017","contentLength":559}},{"pageContent":"An interview with Dr. Karl Dawson The following is an edited transcript of our interview with Dr. Karl Dawson, vice president and chief scientific officer at Alltech. For Karl’s full bio, click here. Before you joined Alltech, you were head of the University of Kentucky (UK) animal science department for 20 years, and you still serve as an adjunct professor with UK. You have a unique insight from being in the private sector business as well as academia. How do we interest the next generation in ag science? That’s a real interesting question because there’s been a gap develop between what we call agriculture, particularly animal science, and the technologies that are being developed today. As a scientist, I think the technologies are really exciting, but sometimes it’s kind of hard to get the next generation, particularly the people from rural America and agriculture, to get excited about the same things. We have a lot of unique technologies. We talk about molecular biology and the things we can see with molecular biology; most farmers I talk to, most siblings from farmer’s kids that are coming off the farm, do not have a good understanding of what those things are, so we have this gap that we need to fill. What we’re finding is that often times just the university education is not enough to give them confidence and the ability to lead in agriculture through using these technologies. One of the things we are doing right now is looking at a lot of outside programs that go beyond their degree and beyond academic training to see how we can interest students in doing those things. It starts at a very young level. We have programs that are set up at the elementary school. On our staff in research, we have two liaisons that do nothing but interact with college, high school and elementary students to get them interested in what we’re doing in terms of science and how that can be incorporated into farm life. Other programs that are very interesting are those that are competitive. We have an innovation program, where we have students build projects that will become a business plan themselves, taking technology and applying it to specific problems. It’s an outside-of-the-classroom activity that gets students excited. There is nothing like seeing them light up when they win an award for a project. We have, at a higher level up, a career program. This is built around the idea that students who come out of college need that little extra boost and piece of information. We actually take students and embed them into the business situation and, in some cases, right on the farm so they get to know the animals and what the farm business really looks like. This is before they go out and try to set up their own business or work within a commercial business. The take-home message is that we really need to give experience, hands-on experience outside of the classroom. That’s really becoming almost a requirement for our people as they move into our business. That certainly makes sense. As a professor, and on the Alltech side as the head of our research program, are the up-and-comers that you’re seeing from an agriculture background, or do they come into agriculture by chance because of other things they are interested in? You run into both kinds. I came up through the agricultural school system, so I’m used to land-grant universities and the kids that came from the farm. But I actually looked at the list of students that were competing in our Young Scientist awards, and I asked them: How many of you are from an agriculture background? Of the 15 sitting in the room, only two raised their hands. You know, the kids are gravitating to agriculture because they see some of the applications that can take place. It’s almost reverse of what we think. We think about children leaving the farm and never coming back. These are students coming in from urban environments, from science environments, and wanting to understand what’s going on on the farm. That’s encouraging and fascinating. It really is. You think about that and it really reflects the excitement of agriculture research and application technology. I kind of coined a term I’m going to use in my presentation here talking about the “farmer technologist”; that is the kind of people who will probably be our leaders in the future.

But upon speaking with her further, you’ll discover that she actually grew up on a 60-cow dairy farm in the Netherlands, the birthplace of Gouda cheese. When her husband, Rolf, also from the Netherlands, came to America to become a dairyman in May 2002, he and his brother started with 350 cows. Since then, the business has expanded to include 900 cows and a booming direct-to-consumer business, all of which started with a dream and a particular fondness for cheese. A truly cheesy idea In the years that followed her move to the cold Midwestern state, Marieke and Rolf grew both farm and family, and they are now parents to five children. Though she already had a great deal on her plate, Marieke wanted to utilize her skills and degree in dairy business but wasn’t sure how. Then, late one evening as she was contemplating opportunities, Marieke realized how much she missed authentic Dutch Gouda. After waking her husband with her idea and being told to wait until morning, Marieke set to work. She began her research and obtained a cheese license (required in the state of Wisconsin), then studied cheese crafting in Wisconsin and Holland. And in November of 2006, with an original recipe and a set of ideals, Marieke Gouda was born. The business was practically an overnight success. Marieke won her first of many awards just four months after opening her doors. Since then, Marieke Gouda has grown to include a cheese store and gift shop — which sells specialty items from both Wisconsin and Holland — as well as a restaurant, aptly named Café Dutchess. Located near a major Wisconsin highway, Penterman Farm and Marieke Gouda give visitors an opportunity to watch cheese being made on-site. The barn sits just a few hundred yards from the store. Raw milk is piped straight from the parlor bulk tank to the cheese floor. Guests can watch through observation windows as the milk is first turned into curds, then washed, drained, pressed, brined, coated and aged. The Marieke Gouda experience is both welcoming and educational. For the love of cheese When it comes to cheese, Marieke feels there is a special kind of magic in the industry. Good food has a way of bringing people together, and that is something she is happy to encourage through distribution of her products. She truly enjoys the people she works with in her business — and throughout the rest of the industry. She relies on the support of fellow cheese-makers and cheesemongers (independent cheese salesmen) to learn, teach and share her passion. There is something delightful about Marieke Penterman, seen in her passion for the cheese she makes, the staff she works with, the industry she supports, the customers who enjoy her product and her love for the cows and farmer. When you walk into Marieke’s shop, there is a sense of welcome, home and comfort. The entire team is filled with excitement to share their delicious product and share the story of Marieke Gouda. When Marieke first thought of starting a creamery, she knew she didn’t want to fail. She believes there are two versions of failure: one is trying something and not succeeding long term, and the other — in her view — is not even trying. As the dairy industry continues to develop, it is important that people like Marieke continue to take risks to grow the dairy market and educate the public about the hard work that goes into the food we all consume daily.

Why are they such a significant risk to your herd? What are mycotoxins? Mycotoxins are natural substances produced by molds in the field and during the storage of grains, feeds and forages. With over 500 diverse types of mycotoxins discovered (yes, there are over 500!), it is a prevalent issue that can negatively affect your herd’s productivity, efficiency and profitability. How do mycotoxins affect your herd? Pigs are extremely sensitive to mycotoxins. The presence of mycotoxins, even at low levels in feed, reduces performance in growing and breeding animals, affects immune and health status, and can ultimately lead to death. As crop harvest season approaches, mycotoxin contamination will be an even bigger issue. Weekly Monday Mycotoxin Report videos have reported on the poor quality of wheat and mycotoxin contamination. The Alltech 37+® mycotoxin analytical services laboratory is also currently conducting a 2017 Summer Harvest Survey of wheat throughout the U.S. and Canada. Final results will be released in a couple of months, but initial samples show high levels of DON, T-2/HT-2 and zearalenone. According to Dr. Alexandra Weaver, a mycotoxin management expert from Alltech, these are key symptoms that producers should be aware of if DON, T-2/HT-2 and zearalenone are present: Lower feed intake and feed refusal Gut health challenges: damage to intestinal tract, increase in intestinal pathogens Altered immune status: increased susceptibility to other diseases, poor response to vaccinations Reduced growth rates Impacts on reproductive performance: abortions, reduced conception rates, increase in mummies or stillborn, increased variation within litter What can you do? Programs such as the Alltech® Mycotoxin Management program provide a tailored solution to help control mycotoxins through a combination of mycotoxin management tools, mycotoxin testing and nutritional technologies. Effective mycotoxin management is about seeing the whole challenge, from the farm to the feed mill and from risk assessment to feed management. Being proactive instead of reactive will benefit you and your herd in the long run.

You and your horses are likely chomping at the bit (pun intended) to head outside and take full advantage of the free buffet. But before you turn those ponies loose, ask yourself: Are you thinking strategically about pasture management? Why utilize rotational grazing? If horses are allowed to graze on one pasture continuously, they can quickly eat down the quality forage, leaving behind weeds and potentially bare ground. Given the choice, horses will selectively graze on their favorite plants and grasses and may completely neglect certain areas while overgrazing others. Whenever a plant is grazed on, it needs time to regenerate leaves and restore energy to its root system. If grazed on again before roots are re-energized, the plant grows weaker. If regularly overgrazed, the plant will ultimately die. Rotational grazing is meant to stop this cycle from taking place. By utilizing rotational grazing, you could potentially double the amount of forage produced and salvage this precious resource, thereby saving a great deal on additional hay costs. This is because rotational grazing allows portions of pasture to rest and recover, particularly the most heavily grazed plants and grasses. A pasture can be divided into several segments to allow ample time for rested areas to grow back to a reasonable grazing height. How do I begin a rotational grazing program? The way you divide your pasture(s) will depend on several factors, including climate, soil fertility, rainfall/irrigation, drainage, types of plants and grasses, and number of horses grazing. Removing horses from an area when the grass has reached an approximate height of 3 to 4 inches (using a color-coded grazing stick can be very helpful) can prevent overgrazing from occurring and allow you to take advantage of the underutilized sections. If you are transitioning a paddock to its rest period, you will need to remove manure, trim to an even height to encourage grasses to regrow uniformly and allow approximately three to four weeks’ rest. You’ll need at least four paddocks (1 to 2 acres per horse, per paddock) to maintain this schedule. Using more will allow for briefer grazing periods and increased rest, which is even better. A smart strategy is to keep a dry lot available and feed hay when longer rest periods are warranted. You may also be wondering how long you should allow horses to graze on pasture sections. This will be dependent on the number of horses, length of daily turnout and size of the area, as well as the other factors mentioned previously. A good rule of thumb is to plan for one week’s use of each section but to monitor closely. Walking the pastures, preferably daily, will allow you to ensure that areas aren’t being overgrazed and to check that fencing is working properly. Temporary electric fencing is generally most effective for this strategy as it can be adjusted at any time. It is also worth noting that you should keep horses inside or in a dry lot during wet weather to prevent pasture damage from hooves. What about water? One challenge associated with rotational grazing is that we are often using automatic waterers and the question of accessibility comes into play. Obviously, you won’t be able to provide easy access to the waterer in all instances, so you may have to get creative when it comes to providing adequate water. Setting up temporary troughs, checking them often and moving them around the paddock(s) periodically can help to avoid creating particularly muddy areas or soft ground, which could lead to pasture damage. Is rotational grazing worth the hassle? I know what you’re thinking. This sounds like a lot of extra work, and that’s because it is. But the time, effort and commitment can truly pay off in the end, with the potential to increase forage quantity and quality, improve horse health, save money (less spent on hay) and decrease both you and your horses’ environmental footprint, making rotational grazing a very worthwhile endeavor.

The group toured a variety of crops, from watermelons to cotton and from onions to peaches. Tradition meets innovation Dixondale Farms, the group’s first stop, has spent the last 104 years planting, harvesting and packing their onions and, more recently, cantaloupes by hand for use throughout Texas. Their transplant onion business has expanded into being available throughout the country in a growing mail order market. “It was interesting to learn how they took the innovative opportunity of divesting from only corporate farms to selling to even the home grower market,” said Marcos De Giacomo from Qualicilo, a consultancy and agricultural dealership company in Brazil, who is participating in his third ACS tour. An exchange of ideas between global experts One of the most rewarding aspects of the annual tour is the opportunity that participants have to exchange ideas not only with each other, but with the growers they visit. They often find that they are dealing with the same issues and the same diseases despite living half a world away. They share ideas on how to fight issues such as Fusarium mycotoxins. Conversations arise about the different food safety regulations and residue requirements in each country. They trade perspectives on how to meet and exceed the expectations set by different countries and by consumers. “We always have to be striving to make ourselves and our businesses better, and we can’t do that without seeing what’s out there and what other people are doing,” said De Giacomo. “These farms we visited and the people we’ve met, they take on the role of teachers, and hopefully we’ve taught them something, too.” Have a question or comment?","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/getting-out-your-crop-comfort-zone","title":"\n\n                    Getting out of your crop comfort zone\n                    ","date":"May 19, 2017","contentLength":339}},{"pageContent":"Dr. Anna Catharina Berge, owner of Berge Veterinary Consulting BVBA, is a veterinarian with extensive knowledge and skills combining real-life animal husbandry with epidemiological perspectives on animal and public health challenges. She shares with us her insights into the epidemic of African Swine Fever, which has rapidly spread from China to Western Europe, and offers tips on how producers or farms can implement stronger biosecurity measures to mitigate the spread of this disease. What biosecurity measures should be implemented at the farm level to prevent the transmission of African Swine Fever (ASF)? The key to protecting a farm from ASF is to have a very high level of external biosecurity. External biosecurity includes herd protection measures that are implemented to reduce the risk of introduction of disease-causing organisms into a farm. The highest risk of introduction of ASF in the farm is through the introduction of live pigs onto a farm; this always presents a risk, and it is very important to source the animals from trusted suppliers and use the highest level of cleaning and disinfection of transports. ASF can also spread on vehicles, equipment and people. Ensure that workers and visitors to the farms have not been in contact with any other pigs prior to entering the farm for 48 hours and that dedicated clothing is used on the farm. Carcass-hauling trucks are high-risk for spreading diseases and should never enter into the farm. ASF in large commercial farms in Russia and Lithuania has been explained by those farms lacking compliance with the biosecurity rules, such as improper disinfection of clothing and boots, or contaminated food brought onto the premises. Contaminated pig meat products have caused several outbreaks on farms, and therefore, no food made from pig meat that has not been properly heat-treated (salami, cured sausages, cold-smoked meats) should be brought onto a farm, and human food waste should not be given to the pigs. How long does ASF survive, in hot or cold conditions? ASF is relatively tough and can survive in the environment and in pig carcasses for a long time. ASF virus survival has been estimated in feces and urine up to eight and 15 days, respectively, and five days at 21° Celsius (Davies et al., 2015). Survival times in the environment [of] up to 18 months have been reported. Meat must be heated to at least 70° Celsius for 30 minutes to inactivate ASF virus, and 30 minutes at 60° Celsius for serum and body fluids. Curing and smoking pork products does not destroy the virus. Is ASF airborne? The virus is not considered a major airborne virus. The half-life of ASF in the air was, on average, 14 to 19 minutes, as analyzed by PCR, and virus titration respectively (De Carvalho et al., Vet Microbiol 2013, 165:243-51). It can be found in the rooms where infected pigs are present, but airborne transmission is unlikely between farms. Can we do more to control transmission via wild boar populations? If the wild boar population becomes infected with ASF, then it is very difficult to control and eradicate the disease. It is very important to not throw any food waste into nature because there are real risks that wild boar can become infected through food waste. It is possible that the current outbreak of ASF in wild boar in the Belgian Ardennes has been due to food waste originating from Eastern Europe. It is very important that there is a good compensation for farmers in the case of ASF outbreaks, so that farmers do not hide outbreaks and discard carcasses in nature, where wild boars can be infected. A large wild boar population increases the risk that infection will spread in the population, and therefore, it is important to keep the wild boar population in control through hunting. The hunting community should have good information and rules to collect wild boar carcasses and notify authorities about any dead pigs seen in nature. A very high external biosecurity — with good, complete fences around the pig farm to prevent wild boars from entering — is very important. Domestic pig farms may want to reduce the risk of wild boar transmission by using extra electric fencing around the farm. (Guinat et al., Veterinary Record (2016) 178, 262-267) https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4819659/pdf/vetrec-2016-103593.pdf What ingredients are at highest risk for ASF transmission? We still know relatively little about factors that are important for ASF transmission through contaminated feed. The highest-risk feed ingredients are those pig meat-derived products, or offal. ASF can persist for months in pork meat, fat and skin, and in different types of pork products, such as sausages and salami. Epidemiological studies in the Baltic countries have suggested that fresh grass and seeds potentially contaminated by secretions from infectious wild boars are possible sources of infection for backyard farms. There are currently studies evaluating the potential for ASF to be transmitted via other feed ingredients (Dee et al. 2018, PLoS ONE 13(3): e0194509.) One study simulated a 30-day feed transport condition for various pig pathogens. ASF virus can survive well without a feed matrix and, therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that various feed ingredients or combinations thereof can be potentially infectious. The feedstuffs studied that showed risk for virus survival included porcine-based ingredients, soybean meal, soy oil cake, DDGS, lysine hydrochloride, choline chloride, vitamin D, pork sausage casings and dog and cat food. https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0194509 What dose of ASF is needed in feed to cause infectivity in an animal? Studies indicate that the infectious route via ingestion is higher than via inhalation. The infectious dose of ASF via the oro-nasal route was estimated to be 10 HAD50 (Gallardo et al., 2013). Since pigs can excrete high levels of ASF in feces, urine and saliva, even a small amount of infective material could lead to transmission. Up to 109 HAD50/ml could be detected in blood and up to 105 HAD50/ml in saliva, urine or feces. Fecal samples may remain infective for five days at room temperature and have been found positive even after 11 days when kept at room temperature in the dark. (Davies et al., 2017, Transboundary and Emerging Diseases 64:425-431) Compared to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), why is ASF such a concern for pig health and welfare? ASF is a haemorrhagic fever of domestic pigs that usually causes very high mortality within a short time after infection. There are no treatments or vaccines available for ASF, and all pigs that are not clinically affected on a farm will be culled immediately when it has been diagnosed. ASF is list A disease of the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) and, as such, is governed by trade regulations and restrictions. ASF in a country or region leads to serious restrictions on pig movement, and trade restrictions. In farms that have been diagnosed with ASF, it leads to slaughter and destruction of all pigs. PEDV is a production disease that mainly affects younger pigs, and there are vaccines available to reduce the impact of that disease. PEDV in a country or region does not result in the same huge financial impact on the pig industry. PEDV is not an OIE-listed disease, and there are currently no trade restrictions pertaining to PEDV in Europe and USA. Can I analyze feed or ingredients for ASF? There are ASF real-time PCR kits for testing animals for ASF. However, there are no good methodologies for testing feed on a commercial basis. Should we stop importing or using all ingredients from China and other regions affected? The OIE and the World Trade Organization (WTO) have set up rules regarding the trade of animal products in relation to these type-A epizootic diseases. The OIE and WTO rules should be respected and are deemed enough to protect countries from spread of disease. There is legislation governing trade and regionalization of countries regarding these diseases. Safe trade in meat and meat products around the world is built on the understanding that government veterinary authorities in the country of origin inspect and certify products in accordance with the requirements of the country of destination. It is recommended to take precautions according to what is recommended by the national veterinary authorities. Contact your national veterinary authority for information regarding trade and precautions. Should we stop porcine-to-porcine feeding? Feeding unheated swill can present a risk for ASF if the swill contains pig meat from countries or regions where ASF is present. Swill feeding is regulated by national legislation. If the national legislation allows swill feeding, then it is very important to assure that the swill is thoroughly heated to avoid any risks of transmission of the virus through swill. Countries have, for decades, controlled international garbage, including food waste from ships, airlines and international conveyances. These controls require all international garbage to be disposed of appropriately and not to be used as animal feed. Remember that a small thing — such as bringing back salami from an infected region and throwing the kitchen waste to the pigs — may be enough to trigger an outbreak. Contact your local veterinary authorities to obtain further information regarding the current legislation and recommendations for swill feeding. How long should I quarantine high-risk ingredients from ASF- positive countries? At this time, a specific timeframe cannot be recommended, as there are numerous factors that impact the survival of the virus in various environments. There is currently research on risk-mitigation solutions, including potential feed additive risk-reduction products; a reliable test for bulk feed shipments; potential holding time, to allow any viruses present to degrade before processing; minimum infectious doses of ASF from feed materials; HACCP-like approaches; and blockchain, to verify feed safety from the point of origin through delivery. Models indicate that ASF can survive conditions equivalent to trans-ocean shipping and distribution. The best guarantees for ASF risk reduction can be obtained by ensuring that the supplier of the product has implemented high biosecurity measures, traceability and/or SOP to protect ingredients against ASF. With all the uncertainty surrounding them, what can swine producers and feed mills do to prevent ASF? The highest level of biosecurity is critical to prevent the introduction of ASF into pig farms and to introduce potentially contaminated feed into feed mills. Feed mills and farms should ensure that the supplier of the products/pigs has implemented a high degree of biosecurity, traceability, documentation and third-party certification, to ensure that the risk of ASF contamination is as small as possible. All traffic onto the premises needs to be strictly controlled. Truck disinfection, live animal transport cleaning and disinfection, [and] dedicated roads for feed introduction and all other traffic should be strictly controlled. Reduce contacts with other pig producers, and always have farm-specific clothing and boots that never go outside of the farm. Ensure that workers understand the importance of all biosecurity measures and the importance of segregating the inside of the unit from the outside.

Year. Ever?”) to The New Yorker (“The Worst Year Ever, Until Next Year”) featured profusely at the end of the year. John Oliver, host of HBO’s “Last Week Tonight,” even blew up a giant “2016” during his season finale. When we take a closer look at the overwhelmingly negative stories filling the news — from war and disease to poverty and inequality — it’s not hard to understand why we feel so pessimistic about where the world is heading, because it’s all we seem to hear. Peter Diamandis, however, couldn’t disagree with this paradigm more, pointing out that the technology currently in the hands of billions of individuals today illustrates a power that only countries and governments possessed 20 years ago. “I want to give you a view of the world that impassions me,” Diamandis, founder of the XPRIZE Foundation and co-founder of Singularity University, said at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference (ONE17). “It’s clear that the world is getting better at an extraordinary rate.” What’s the key thing driving this lightning-fast change? Exponential technology. Below are the five exponential trends that Diamandis says will change the world (and you). 1. The world is going linear While humans have evolved to think and live in a local and linear fashion, putting one foot in front of the other in measured, baby steps, Diamandis said that today the world is global and exponential. “Things are changing year to year, not century to decade,” he explained. “This can be disruptive stress or a disruptive opportunity, depending on your point of view.” He pointed to the example of Facebook buying Instagram in 2012, the same year that Kodak, ignoring the digital photography trend, went bankrupt. Technologies are doubling in power every year, giving rise to increasingly powerful exponential technology. In fact, the rate of disruption is so fast today that the average life of the company has dropped to 15 years. “The question is, as you’re starting companies and solving problems: Are you basing these on exponential trends?” asked Diamandis. The technologies that are evolving today and changing the world are riding Moore’s Law, he said. In 1965, Intel co-founder Gordon Moore noticed that the number of transistors per square inch on circuits had doubled every year since they were invented. This trend is continuing and can be applied to all technology. In fact, it’s right on schedule and is enabling us to innovate and make progress at increasingly faster rates. 2. 6Ds of exponentials Diamandis described the way that exponential technology follows Moore’s Law and explodes onto the scene, much as apps such as Snapchat have done in recent years, in six steps, or the “6Ds of exponentials.” He explained the first three steps in the following way: “In the early days of digitization, that growth is rather deceptive,” he said. “But all of a sudden, 30 doublings later, it’s a billion times better, and it becomes disruptive.” After the initial three steps, technology reaches the last three critical steps: Demonetized. Think Uber and Airbnb, which don’t have to create products from scratch. Dematerialized: Technology that once filled entire rooms can now fit into your pocket, such as iPhones. Democratized: Demonetization and dematerialization enable you to offer your products to billions of people around the world. Importantly, Diamandis noted that by 2022, 3 billion new consumers will be online and consuming those products, representing tens of trillions of dollars flowing into the global economy. They will buy technologies that continue to connect the entire planet digitally via ventures such as Google’s Project Loon, further increasing the rate of exponential technology. 3. An explosion of sensors and networks A key element driving exponential technology to new heights includes the sensors and networks connecting people, places and things globally, from drones and satellites to the smartwatch on your wrist, taking images and collecting data on everything imaginable. This connectivity is propelling us from a period of time when we’ve virtually been “blind” to one in which we have an unlimited supply of information. “This, for me, blows my mind,” said Diamandis. “It means that these sensors will allow us to know anything we want, anytime, anywhere.” Furthermore, this technology is experiencing massive price reductions. Huge sensors that were millions of dollars in the 1960s are only $1 today and are molecular in size. This trend is showing no signs of slowing down, and Diamandis predicts that soon we’ll all be proud owners of such tech, such as augmented reality glasses we simply can’t live without. 4. Exponential technology will transform every industry Faster, cheaper computing power is leading to unexpected consequences, Diamandis said, in which technologies such as robotics, 3D applications, virtual reality and artificial intelligence are combining to produce even more groundbreaking products. This is causing a paradigm shift in which every industry will soon be revolutionized by more efficient technology, such as self-driving cars and Watson, an artificial intelligence (AI) program that won an episode of “Jeopardy!” in 2011. Some skeptics are worried about the negative consequences these new technologies might have. “I’m not worried about AI as ‘The Terminator,’” said Diamandis. “I’m worried that AI is going to transform job markets. It’s the rate of change that we need to deal with.” 5. Moonshot thinking The last, and arguably most important, of Diamandis’ five exponential trends is “moonshot thinking,” or thinking about how you can impact more than a billion people with a single venture. The phrase, coined by Google, is the idea that today, any one of us can think about achieving 10 times more growth while the rest of the world is only focused on growing by 10 percent. Diamandis said that this requires a shift in mindset, since we have been trained to accomplish 10 percent more by merely working hard. “When you ask yourself to go 10 times bigger, it forces you to think in a radically different fashion,” he said. “It forces you to throw out all that you’ve done before.” He said that, personally, he focuses on “What’s the moonshot?” at the beginning of all of his new ventures, such as Human Longevity Inc., which aims to make being 100 years old the new 60 years old. “I think, ‘OK, this is impossible; now let’s figure out how to make it happen,’” said Diamandis. The news may continue to beat us down with up-to-the-minute, anxiety-inducing doom and gloom, but by using exponential technology, we can take matters into our own hands to change the world for the better. “We’re living in the most exciting time in human history, a time when you as an individual have access to more capital, more computational power than experts in any time, ever,” said Diamandis. “You can solve any problem you put your mind to, and, ultimately, it’s the power of your passion and your mind that’s the most powerful thing on the planet today.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/peter-diamandis-harnessing-exponential-technology-change-world","title":"\n\n                    Peter Diamandis: Harnessing exponential technology to change the world\n                    ","date":"May 23, 2017","contentLength":1201}},{"pageContent":"“Sometimes you think that to change the world, you need to do the impossible,” said George Blankenship. “I look at it differently. It’s not impossible — it just hasn’t been done yet.” In April 2017, Tesla bypassed General Motors to become the most valuable carmaker in the U.S. Although it only held the top spot briefly, this tech-savvy, boundary-pushing company is not only turning the automotive industry on its head; its innovation is also causing far-reaching disruptions in fields like energy storage, which is critical to the future of renewable energy. How did a seemingly fringe enterprise blow by some of the most iconic carmakers? According to Blankenship, former executive at Apple Computer, Tesla Motors and GAP Inc., who spoke at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference (ONE17), it is absolutely critical to assume that someone is going to redefine your industry. “Whoever does is going to hold the world in the palm of their hand,” he said. The disruptive tactic that Blankenship employed at Apple and Tesla focused heavily on giving customers something they couldn’t live without, before they even knew they wanted it. The clearest example is our modern dependence on smartphones, not for the phone itself, but for the wealth of apps that allow us to lead more efficient lives. The key, Blankenship said, is to create a long-term customer relationship. “What can you do that will keep customers wanting to come back again and again?” he asked. Apple now has one of the most loyal communities of customers in the world. Blankenship said the three most important things a company can do to ensure long-term customer relationships include: Letting people know they are important. Letting people know they will be taken care of. Letting people know that you will be available to help them. Blankenship first executed this strategy at Apple by transforming the company’s brick and mortar stores from simple retail sites to engaging venues where customers could connect directly with a product. They also became the home of the Genius Bar, where customers could stop by to ask for advice about the Apple products they already owned (and purchase even more once they were on-site). Now that greater connectivity and the internet are making it more convenient to learn about products and order them online, the physical stores themselves should be the place where experts make a difference by giving customers time, attention and an experience. Today, this is exactly the stratagem that Tesla is employing. It is redefining the car buying experience by becoming the first car manufacture to put the brand into shopping malls, where families are visiting, taking selfies with their children inside the cars and, of course, asking how soon they can buy the latest model. “You will know if your store is successful and you’re doing a great job if everybody leaves smiling,” explained Blankenship. To excel, Blankenship said it is vital to cultivate a disruptive mindset by doing the following five things: Simplify: Focus only on what’s important. Courage: Don’t listen to outsiders. Alignment: Demonstrate conviction. Celebrate: Successes and failures. First step: Take it! “So, who in this room is ready to close their eyes, envision the possible opportunities of the next 10 years, and then make a difference that will change your industry forever?” asked Blankenship. “Somebody is going to do it. The only question is: Will it be you?”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/george-blankenship-create-experience-keeps-customer-coming-back","title":"\n\n                    George Blankenship: Create an experience that keeps the customer coming back\n                    ","date":"May 22, 2017","contentLength":575}},{"pageContent":"Antibiotic-free is a hot topic these days, but have you noticed the discussions mainly center on poultry? What about pork, “the other white meat?” If pork intends to align itself with poultry in the minds and preferences of consumers, it’s time for the industry to pay heed to the consumer demand for protein produced without the use of antibiotics. Many areas around the world, including the European Union and the United States, are already legislating the judicious use of antibiotics, but some consumers have pushed even further for “no antibiotics ever.” While some consumers’ demands may emanate from misinformation, it doesn’t require a crystal ball to understand that change is at hand for traditional production. According to a recent study by Feed International, 57 percent of respondents report more than half of their company’s production is antibiotic-free. The study was not specific to production animal species, but it’s clear that the antibiotic-free movement isn’t slowing. It’s coming down the pipeline fast, and pork producers would do well to prepare for their customers’ expectations. It is probable that consumers will soon turn their eyes to pig production with the same scrutiny and expectations they have had for poultry. Pork’s majority in stomach share Pork has the greatest stomach share among meats in world consumption. The Alltech Global Feed Survey 2017demonstrated an 8 percent increase in feed for pork production in 2016, and that growth is expected to continue its rise, particularly as the population increases. In the U.S. alone, pork is projected to have a 3 percent growth, according to Rabobank’s 2016 fourth quarter report. Despite its top position among meats and its growth, pork has not contended with the same level of consumer-driven scrutiny as the poultry industry, which has been pressured to remove antibiotics from production as much as is humanely possible. The antibiotic-free pork pack leaders In dealing with the demand for antibiotic-free poultry, some retailers and major restaurant chains have already anticipated the shift in attention to pork. Here is a list of a few that have made their plans regarding future pork sourcing public: Chipotle and Panera Bread: Both have made claims to commit to sourcing some of their meat from antibiotic-free livestock. Subway: Intends to transition to antibiotic-free pork once it completes its chicken and turkey transitions. 2025 is the approximate date. Walmart and BJ’s: Currently have some antibiotic-free pork meat available. Whole Foods: Began offering antibiotic-free food products in 2010. Chick-Fil-A: Aims to be “No antibiotics ever” by 2019, but their commitment has been specific to their chicken. Will the bacon and sausage be next? As retailers begin to pull from the supply chain, we might see a domino effect toward wider adoption of antibiotic-free production within poultry. Suppliers such as Country View Family Farms and Niman Ranch provide antibiotic-free pork according to strict standards. Last year, Tyson announced its Open Prairie Natural Pork produced by pigs raised without any added hormones or growth promoting substances, minimal processing, an all-vegetarian diet and no antibiotics ever. Earlier this year, Smithfield launched an antibiotic-free line of fresh pork products under its Pure Farms brand, which designates pork minimally processed with no antibiotics, steroids, hormones or artificial ingredients. Where else is the pork label turning “antibiotic-free?” Antibiotic-free pork production is flourishing in Denmark, for example. In 1995, a program known as DANMAP was established by the Danish Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Fisheries and the Danish Ministry of Health for “surveillance of antimicrobial consumption and resistance in bacteria from animals, food and humans.” For over 15 years, Danish farmers have only relied on antibiotics to treat illness in their herds. The program they follow allows for this therapeutic use and, when combined with other management techniques such as delayed weaning, it has shown to be just as effective as traditional production. Interestingly, according to an article in the New York Times, it would only cost U.S. farmers $4.50 per head to follow a Danish model. What makes antibiotic-free pork more challenging for producers? What’s holding pork back from capitalizing on the antibiotic-free movement? First and foremost on producers’ minds is the risk of decreased profitability. Animals that do not receive antibiotics are more prone to sickness, and, of course, mortality. On several occasions, Dr. Rodger Main from the College of Veterinary Medicine at Iowa State University has cited a 2011 study in which the cost of producing an antibiotic-free pig was $11 per pig, increasing to more than $15 if one incorporates the overall risk that only 70 percent of the herd will survive production. This is significantly higher than the more recent New York Times estimate, but this range illustrates how exact production costs are highly variable and may vary daily based on feed costs. Another worry is decrease in production weight. This adds to higher production costs and, together with the threat of mortality, can account for the pork industry’s slow adoption of antibiotic-free production, especially given that antibiotic growth promoters have proven their ability to increase animal size and weight. Additionally, certification of antibiotic-free pork can be costly and time-consuming. Transitioning one’s herd from traditional use of antibiotics requires strategic planning and the implementation of counteractive measures to minimize the effect it can have on the operation’s bottom line. What has made antibiotic-free poultry successful? The poultry industry has been finding success in their transition to antibiotic-free production by following practices such as good husbandry, fewer birds in pens, feeding vegetarian diets, increasing downtime between harvesting flocks, etc. Differences in pig production make implementation more challenging: Pigs live longer, increasing the likelihood of an illness within their lifecycle. There is less time to clean and disinfect between herds. Weaning is particularly stressful for piglets and can impact their immune system. However, there are some ways these issues can be addressed. There is evidence that pigs can not only be less susceptible to infectious risks, but may in fact thrive when certain natural feeding supplements are added to the diet.

Recent weeks have seen extreme price volatility in markets for this pair of vitamin feed components that are so vital to animal health and performance. Vitamin E spot prices more than tripled soon after Oct. 31, 2017, when fire broke out at the BASF citral plant situated along the Rhine River in Ludwigshafen, Germany. BASF is by far the world’s largest producer of citral, a key intermediate in the synthesis of vitamins A and E. Compounding matters, the BASF fire was preceded in the summer months by a downturn in production of these vitamins in China. New Chinese government-enforced environmental protection measures are forcing all Chinese vitamin manufacturers to limit production output. “The vitamin industry is considered one of the heavily polluting industries, secondary to chemicals, cement and the pharmaceutical industry,” noted Alexander Buchan, Alltech inventory manager for the Asia-Pacific region. “As a result, the environmental protection tax law will without any doubt have a drastic effect on the manufacturers in China and their efforts for cleaner production.” BASF declared force majeure, which suspends a company’s contractual obligations in the wake of disasters that lie beyond its control, for its citral and isoprenol-based aroma ingredients. The company later extended force majeure to vitamins A and E, shutting down production of both. Those operations cannot be restarted until the supply of citral is re-established and the corresponding intermediates for vitamin A and E again become available. Immediately following the BASF force majeure declaration, all Chinese manufacturers stopped offering quotations in order to increase market prices. Only wholesale commodity agents had adequate stocks, offered at inflated prices higher than the manufacturer price. Once the agents’ stocks were depleted, the Chinese manufacturers began producing again at a higher price, often two to three times that of the agents’ previous offerings to the market. Vitamin A An estimated 40–45 percent of the global vitamin A 1000 feed grade market is currently supplied by precursors that were being manufactured at the BASF citral facility, according to an estimate by Feedinfo News Service. Although the benefits vary from species to species, vitamin A is generally important for immunity and reproduction and helps the heart, lungs, kidneys and other organs function properly. Vitamin E High concentrations of vitamin E are present in fresh green forage such as hay and silage. But levels decrease as plants mature and are stored. The most important functions of vitamin E are as an antioxidant and in boosting the immune system. Vitamin E has also been shown to be essential for the integrity and optimal function of the reproductive system as well as the muscular, circulatory and nervous systems in animals and humans. Vitamin E deficiency causes disorders of the cellular membrane due to the oxidative degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, resulting in protein oxidation and ultimately leading to nucleic acid damage. The symptoms are specific to each animal species. Due to the oxidative degradation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, vitamin E deficiency generally causes liver necrosis. A lack of vitamin E in the diet can cause species-specific disorders such as encephalomalacia (“crazy chick syndrome”) in poultry and exudative diathesis (abnormal permeability of the capillary walls). The deficiency is also linked to mulberry heart disease, which results in the sudden heart failure of pigs, and “white muscle disease” (muscular dystrophy) in livestock and poultry. Barely detectable subclinical vitamin E deficiency can result in impaired feed conversion and retarded growth. It has also been shown to lead to reduced stress resistance, higher susceptibility to infectious diseases and lower fertility. What should livestock producers do in the vitamin A and E crisis? So, among producers struggling to maintain healthy herds, the burning question is, “What now?” Crises have a way of sparking innovation. “I think we need to rethink vitamin E formulation strategies and, in particular, the tendency to increase supplementation rates that has been seen over the last few years,” said Dr. Richard Murphy, research director at the Alltech European Bioscience Centre in Dunboyne, Ireland. “If we look, for instance, at reformulating vitamin levels based on the synergy and antioxidant contribution that other nutrients like selenium offer, then we can look at reducing the effective inclusion levels of vitamin E.” Lowering vitamin E inclusions, however, is not as simple as finding a replacement. “The reality of antioxidants is that they do not act alone, but instead constantly interact with one another, forming an intricate antioxidant network,” said Dr. Kate Jacques, Alltech director of nutrition. “No two antioxidants interact within this web with the same specificity, so while antioxidants work in concert, one cannot replace the other.” In the case of the vitamin E shortage, the question is not how do we replace vitamin E, but rather, how do we maximize the efficiency of the antioxidant network with less vitamin E? That is exactly the premise of the Alltech product EconomasE®. EconomasE is a proprietary antioxidant blend that has been found to support the antioxidant network and improve the efficiency of antioxidant systems that depend on vitamin E. Developed using gene expression measures, research scientists found that this particular blend of nutrients could give a similar gene expression profile to that activated by supplemental vitamin E. Rather than replacing vitamin E, EconomasE supports the rest of the antioxidant system and makes the most of the existing vitamin E. By ensuring the optimal activities of the existing antioxidant system in the cell and assuring a supply of essential trace minerals that are necessary for antioxidant enzymes, EconomasE reduces the amount of vitamin E necessary to keep oxidation at bay. Is EconomasE a real solution when there is a serious shortage of vitamin E? “Further genomic studies have found that EconomasE increased the activity of genes that normally respond to vitamin E,” said Murphy. “In fact, when EconomasE is included in the diet, it is possible to reduce vitamin E supplementation without compromising animal welfare and performance.” In livestock performance trials, EconomaseE has also shown promise as an alternative antioxidant system by supporting antioxidant capacity and decreasing the cost of feed. In broilers, birds supplemented with EconomasE exhibited equal or better performance and antioxidant activity compared to birds supplemented with vitamin E (the optimal inclusion rate was found to be 200 grams per ton). In both dairy and beef, EconomasE at 2 grams per animal per day showed benefits to reproduction. There is no sign of vitamin prices relenting in the early months of 2018; meanwhile, EconomasE provides a way to optimize antioxidant defense and offset the cost of vitamin E. When will BASF resume production? BASF does not anticipate restarting the Ludwigshafen citral plant before late March 2018. Once production at the citral plant is re-established, vitamins A and E are expected to be available for transport six to 12 weeks thereafter and will then be subject to country-specific shipping lead times. BASF has established a website to provide updates, available here.

During this busy time, remember to not only monitor what’s coming in from the field, but also to think about what could be happening in other regions from which you may be purchasing feed ingredients. Molds and yeasts can grow very rapidly as the weather warms in the spring and in the heat of the early summer months. But what about the end of summer and early fall? The weather across North America was extremely variable this summer — from extremely hot temperatures to drought to floods, week after week. How do these weather patterns affect the crops, and what should you be looking for in your feed this fall? It is commonly understood that drought-stressed fields do not yield well. Digestibility and overall quality will be poor from feed grown in drought-stressed areas. Can living organisms like molds grow during a drought? The answer is yes: many species of molds will still grow during a drought, or they become dormant and wait for the right growing environment to return. One example of a drought-tolerant mold is Aspergillus. Many times, Aspergillus molds will appear olive green to yellowish in color on infected plants. Aflatoxins come from the mold species Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus parasiticus. Aflatoxins are carcinogenic and thrive in hot conditions. Aflatoxin B1 can convert into M1 and can be found in milk. If this toxin is found over a set limit, the milk must be discarded. When fed to livestock, aflatoxins cause liver damage, suppress the immune system and reduce protein synthesis. What about areas under heavy rain? Several molds are typically found during summers of heavy rain, including Fusarium, Penicillium, Mucor, Rhizopus, etc. Fusarium is commonly found in both normal growing conditions and during wetter months. Many times, this mold first appears white and will change to a reddish-pink color. Under stress, both in the field and during storage, this mold can form many mycotoxins, including the trichothecenes family (DON or Vomitoxin, T-2, etc.), fusaric acid, fumonisins, and zearalenones. Clinical signs that these are present include immune suppression, bowel hemorrhaging, reduced intakes, poor milk production, reduced weight gains, abortions, conception challenges, vasodilation and even mortality. The Penicillium molds will typically show blue to greenish in color, or potentially white, depending on the host crop. Penicillium molds will typically infect feed during storage, but abnormal weather patterns — such as heavy rains or, sometimes, cooler temperatures — can cause more mold to form. Certain tillage practices can also influence mold growth. When stressed, Penicillium molds can form patulin, Penicillic acid and ochratoxin. Clinical signs that these are present include edema, rumen upsets, loose manure, bowel hemorrhaging and increased rates of mortality. This is a minute sampling of the mycotoxin challenges that can exist during harvest in your fields. Remember: the commodities or other purchased feedstuffs that are shipped in by boat, train or truck may present their own mold and mycotoxin challenges. Check the origin of purchased feed to determine what stress or abnormal weather was experienced in that region. Your local dealers, nutritionists or Alltech representatives can put together information on mycotoxin results from other regions. If you want to be especially diligent in lessening mycotoxin challenges, an on-farm RAPIREAD® mycotoxin test or Alltech 37+® mycotoxin test will check your feeds for any concerns.

You never forget your first order You can only start a business by going with what you know, and I knew how to improve fermentation. So, when I came across a problem related to fermentation, I took the opportunity to explain to the potential customer how I could solve the problem. At the beginning, I was a one-man operation. When I received my first order on a Friday for Tuesday, I said “no problem,” even though it meant manufacturing 4,000 pounds ... and I didn’t have ingredients, the needed equipment or any packaging. I recruited my next door neighbor, bought bags at the local grocery and shopped for the 16 ingredients all over the city. Then, in my home garage, we took spoonfuls of our ingredients, mixed them in a drum and then poured the mixture into 16,000 Ziploc bags we had set up all across the lawn. Fittingly, it was Labor Day weekend. After 36 hours, Alltech was ready to be launched. I called the customer and said the order was ready, and, much to my shock, he said, “Sorry to tell you this, Pearse, but we’re going to be closing down, so we don’t need your product any longer. I meant to call you.” I supposed to myself that I just witnessed the rise and demise of my business in one weekend. “Shucks, go ahead and send it to me anyway,” he said. “We’ll get back up and running in another month or so.” Then, I decided to tell him, “Well, there’s something else. Knowing you like I know you, I knew you’d quickly want more product, so I went ahead and made two batches for you.” To which he responded, “Oh, alright then, go ahead and ship that, too.” As soon as I got off the phone, it was back to the neighbor’s house. “We’re working again this weekend,” I said. My advice to young entrepreneurs: Take an order, any order. Don’t get hung up on the details, and take heart that you never get orders from the people you think you’ll get orders from. Work with what you know. Identify a problem and solve it. Always deliver what you say you’ll do. Stay away, as long as you can, from taking partners. Make a profit. Don’t sell yourself too short. Appear successful. Create your own culture. Go with people who celebrate you, not those who tolerate you. Share your success and stay curious. For heaven’s sake, do something about your idea. Don’t get it right, just get it going.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/my-first-order-10-tidbits-advice-aspiring-entrepreneur","title":"\n\n                    My first order: 10 tidbits of advice for the aspiring entrepreneur\n                    ","date":"March 23, 2017","contentLength":456}},{"pageContent":"In January 2017, 7.91 billion eggs were produced in the U.S. Though that is already a massive amount, imagine if we could increase that number by 10 percent. It’s estimated that 10 to 15 percent of eggs laid do not make it to the end user, resulting in a dollar loss between $1.32 and $2.00 per bird1. Why eggs don’t make it to the store shelf The two main reasons that eggs do not make it to store shelves are: Egg loss: broken eggs that cannot be sold Downgrading: eggs that are given a lower score due to visible defects These issues are nothing new but continue to be responsible for economic loss in the layer industry, and both are related to the quality of the eggshell. Strengthening the shell While downgrading can be traced back to several different factors, egg loss is directly associated with a weak eggshell. One of the best ways to help ensure that the eggs produced have a strong shell is through the hen’s nutrition. If we can get her the correct ingredients, then she will be able to provide a more durable egg. It’s widely known that eggshells are composed mainly of calcium carbonate, phosphorus and magnesium. If we look at the shells more closely, we can find traces of iron, manganese, copper and other organic matter. Even though there might only be small amounts of these minerals found in the eggshell, they play a critical role in eggshell formation. But for maximum effectiveness, the form of those minerals matters. Organic minerals are absorbed more readily by the hen2. Including these organic minerals in layer diets could mean the difference between an egg being discarded or making it to the store shelf. Putting the eggshell to the test In addition to focusing on nutrition, there are ways you can monitor the strength of the eggs being produced. Recently, Alltech added a new tool to help producers quantify and better understand their eggshell strength. The Egg Force Reader measures the force it takes to fracture an eggshell. Taking a sample of 100 or more eggs allows the producer to get a good average eggshell performance. Using this data, as well as downgrade data, producers can identify if their eggs will be able to hold up in processing. Furthermore, this data, in addition to candling an egg (shining a light on the egg), can help to identify areas of improvement in nutrition regarding eggshell quality. They say not to cry over spilled milk, but what about a broken egg? Or 791 million broken eggs in one month? Put your eggs to the test with the Egg Force Reader.

What is A2, and how can it affect me? Cow’s milk is a good source of protein, containing 8 grams of protein per 8-ounce glass. The primary proteins in milk are casein and whey, with casein accounting for about 80 percent of the total protein. There are different types of casein, with one of the three major casein proteins being beta-casein. A1 and A2 are two variants of beta-casein. Depending on a cow’s genetic makeup, it can produce A1 beta-casein only, A1 and A2 beta-casein, or A2 beta-casein only. Commonly, unless otherwise labeled, both A1 and A2 are expressed in the traditional cow’s milk found on supermarket shelves. There are small variations between the two proteins — they’re nearly identical — and while there is no strong scientific research on the topic, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest milk containing only A2 beta-casein is easier for some people to digest. When A1 protein is digested in the small intestine, it produces beta-casomorphin-7 (BCM-7), a peptide that has been linked to stomach discomfort and symptoms similar to those experienced by people with lactose intolerance. Experiencing stomach discomfort (symptoms such as gas, bloating and diarrhea) after consuming dairy products is often attributed to lactose intolerance. However, a few researchers now believe that it may be BCM-7, not lactose, that is producing these symptoms in some people.1-3 A2 milk The a2 Milk Company was founded in 2000 in New Zealand, providing milk from cows that only produce the A2 protein. The a2 Milk Company tests the DNA of its cows using a strand of hair from the tail of each cow to ensure the animals produce milk that contains the A2 protein only. These cows are then segregated and milked separately. The milk is also tested after production to ensure it does not contain A1 protein. The company owns the patent to the method for identifying the A2 milk cows, meaning it’s the only brand that can sell milk with the A2 label.4 Should I choose A2 milk over traditional cow’s milk? For consumers who do not experience any digestive issues with milk consumption, there is no evidence to suggest benefits in drinking A2 milk over traditional cow’s milk, which contains both the A1 and A2 proteins. But, for consumers who report digestive discomfort when drinking traditional cow’s milk, it may be a suitable option to be able to enjoy milk and its health benefits without symptoms. It is important to note that A2 milk still contains lactose and milk protein, so it is not an appropriate alternative for people with diagnosed lactose intolerance, galactosemia or a milk allergy.

Food safety has become a top priority among poultry producers today because of its direct and significant effect on brand reputation. The effects of a food recall are always costly and can severely harm a brand's reputation if consumers lose trust. For over two decades, the meat and poultry industries have been following the guidelines of Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point, or HACCP, a management system for food safety put in place to address potential biological, chemical and physical contamination. This allows producers to identify possible hazards in order to take the necessary actions to reduce or eliminate the risk. There is no silver bullet strategy that has the capability to address every potential threat along the production chain, so producers and plants use a variety of strategies at their critical control points. Three steps to improve food safety As stated on the National Chicken Council website, some ways that producers can improve their food safety include: The use of feed additives that can reduce the growth of potential microbial hazards. Approved rinses to kill any surviving bacteria. Metal detectors to make sure physical contaminants are not found in a product. In addition to food safety systems, producers also need to make sure that their consumers understand proper food handling practices. Consumers should be made aware of the proper way to clean, prepare, cook and chill raw agricultural products in order to further reduce the risk of food-borne illnesses. West Liberty Foods, a leading supplier of sliced meats in the U.S., understands that the concepts of food safety and consumer trust are crucial to success. The company’s chairman, Paul Hill, explained its strategy in a recent Alltech feature story.

Mycotoxins are chemical secondary metabolites produced by molds as a reaction mechanism in response to an environmental stimulus. Molds may produce mycotoxins during the growing season, at harvest or during storage of feed materials post-harvest. It is common for feedstuffs to be contaminated with multiple mycotoxins, as one mold can produce several types of mycotoxins or multiple molds can produce mycotoxins in the same feedstuff. In fact, analysis conducted by the Alltech 37+® Analytical Laboratory shows that multi-mycotoxin contamination is present in 92.3 percent of 2017-2018 poultry feeds globally. As a result, the presence of mycotoxins is a major issue faced by the poultry industry worldwide. Poultry that consume high levels of mycotoxins in feed may have obvious clinical signs of mycotoxicosis in relation to specific tissues, organs or performance. However, of more concern, often, is the long-term intake of lower levels of mycotoxins, as symptoms are not noticed daily but still add up to become a long-term problem. In this instance, it is important to watch the birds closely and look for a variety of specific and non-specific symptoms of mycotoxins. A common sign of mycotoxin consumption by poultry at both lower and higher concentrations is the appearance of lesions, which start in the mouth and continue along the gastrointestinal tract. These lesions are often caused by trichothecene mycotoxins such as deoxynivalenol (DON) and T2/HT-2 toxins, which cause oxidative stress and damage to cells along the intestinal tract. These lesions — along with other side effects in the gastrointestinal tract, such as changes to mucus production, reduced villi length and impacts on gut-level immunity — can suppress health and performance and can also expose chickens to increased gut pathogen colonization. The presence of mycotoxins, such as DON and fumonisins, have been linked to increased colonization and severity of such pathogens as Salmonella, E. coli and Clostridium perfringens. Considering the many effects that mycotoxin have on poultry health, performance changes are also likely. Research shows that growing birds may have reduced weight gain and poor feed efficiency, while layers and breeders may have reduced egg production, poor egg quality or decreased hatchability. Young birds will typically be more susceptible to the impacts of mycotoxins. Like so many nutritional and health factors, the impacts of mycotoxins on a young bird could alter the ability of the bird to attain its genetic capacity for performance. Using the Alltech PROTECT™ Calculator and average risk in 2018 North American poultry feed as analyzed by Alltech 37+®, broilers may lose about 3.6 g/d in gain and have a 4.8 percent increase in feed conversion ratio. Likewise, layers may lose about 5.2 eggs over a 60-week egg-laying period. When mycotoxins impact performance, there is likely also a loss of profitability. Poultry producers should be aware of the costs of mycotoxins in order to better manage the risk. Due to the characteristics of mycotoxins, laboratory analysis of a feedstuff or finished feed is the first step in understanding risk. There are a limited number of commercial laboratories in the world capable of analyzing multiple mycotoxins from one sample. The Alltech 37+® Analytical Laboratory, located in Kentucky, provides complete analysis for 50 different mycotoxins in a single sample and also considers the total mycotoxin challenge present in each sample, rather than just looking at the individual mycotoxins. As such, the results of the analysis more closely reflect commercial production and the challenges faced by producers. Since all species and lifecycles of birds are susceptible to mycotoxins to varying degrees, samples analyzed through the 37+® Program are also provided a Risk Equivalent Quantity (REQ), one number that calculates the cumulative effect of mycotoxins and the overall risk to the target animal group associated with the sample. An understanding of mycotoxicosis in poultry is complicated by the occurrence of several mycotoxins together and their interactions in the animal, as well as their non-specific symptoms. It is clear that multiple mycotoxin contamination is an unavoidable risk — and is costly in today’s poultry production. It is important, then, to use the right economic assessment methods to evaluate the multiple contaminations and, then, to control mycotoxin risk in the feed mill and at the farm level. I want to learn more about protecting my poultry operation from mycotoxins.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/dont-let-hidden-thieves-rob-your-poultry-operation-profit","title":"\n\n                    Don’t let hidden thieves rob your poultry operation of profit \n                    ","date":"August 27, 2018","contentLength":738}},{"pageContent":"Whether your dairy’s goal is to maintain or expand herd size, disease management of heifers is an important focus for producers. Exposure to molds and mycotoxins can leave heifers more vulnerable to enteritis (caused by E. coli and Salmonella) and pneumonia, which, when coupled with potential feeding challenges, can not only lead to death, but delay the onset of puberty and cause long-term negative effects to reproduction and milk production. A dairy farm’s future is based on the future heifers produced and raised, a process that can carry a hefty cost. The cost of raising replacement heifers is $2.77 per day or $1,736 weaning to freshening.1 Mycotoxins' potential impact on health, immunity and performance of heifer calves and growing and breeding heifers In a study of dairy cattle, operation costs increased by 3 percent in the presence of mycotoxins. The annual return over variable costs decreased from 14.5 percent to 7.6 percent due to the presence of mycotoxins.9 Mycotoxins: Impact immunity and increase susceptibility and severity to other disease challenges, such as enteritis and respiratory diseases (e.g., bovine respiratory disease). Reduce vaccine titer response and vaccination protection.2 Delay onset of puberty due to changes in calves/ growing heifers, with typical growth patterns becoming longer and causing increased time to first service and first conception.4 Contribute to metabolic instability and reduce performance characteristics, such as milk production and sustainable udder and leg health.4, 7 Alter nutrient absorption and metabolism’s effect on the endocrine system as well as suppression of the immune system.2, 6, 7 Reduce feed intake or contribute to feed refusal. 2, 3, 8, 9 A large number and variety of mycotoxins are present in plant material and especially in stored products. Exposure to these complex mixtures of mycotoxins may result in unexpected health risks. Mycotoxins' effect on animal health and performance has been demonstrated and is now well accepted. This is particularly true for ruminants, especially under stressful conditions, such as in calves.9 Due to a pre-existing negative energy balance, cows in the transition period are considered to be particularly sensitive to exposure to feeds contaminated with molds, fungal spores and mycotoxins.10 The use of mycotoxin deactivators under conditions where mycotoxins are thought to be present, even at low levels, appears to restore productivity and financial returns to a large extent.9 It has been speculated by researchers, such as Dr. Johanna Fink-Gremmels of the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands, that dairy replacement heifers could potentially lose up to 25 percent of their full genetic potential of milk production due to disease in early life and feed challenges from mycotoxins. This has a potential cost of $1,000 to $1,500 or more per three-year average of lifetime milk of a future cow. Effective mycotoxin management is about seeing the whole challenge.

Cainthus is a machine-vision company specializing in health analytics for crop and livestock. Tell us a little bit about why digitizing agriculture is important and what the potential is. How we got into all of this is, we looked at what was going on in the agriculture world. My brother and I got extremely concerned about how, if we keep on farming in our “green revolution” style agriculture of monocultures plus chemical input, we are effectively going to kill our planet. We realized that we need to make things far more efficient, and farm in more environmentally friendly ways, in order to stave off what currently looks like an inevitability at the moment. We then said, “What’s the best way to go about doing this?” Despite coming from an agriculture background, I didn’t realize the sheer absence of measurement that was at the commercial field or commercial livestock level. We realized if you want to improve agriculture, first of all you need to start measuring things. Then, once you can measure things, you can work out how to improve them and then ultimately that will hopefully lead to a better system. I am very much a science fiction fan, and one of the things that always excited me as a child was the concept of robots working in farms and fields. When we started out on this journey, it was all toward the view of what we needed to do to get robots into our fields. One of the things we found out was, a robot is actually only as good as the data that feeds it. If you have an absence of data and an absence of measurement in agriculture, then the robots are never going to be there. My personal opinion is, we will never be able to move away from monocultures until we have on-demand precision harvesting, which probably needs to be performed by robots, given the cost in increased human labor. When we went looking at what was the best way to systematically capture commercial field scale data in a manner that would be affordable to the farmer, we couldn’t get beyond the fact that digital imaging was going to be the way to do it. Camera technology is increasing at an exponential level at the moment. We only just got HD TVs and they are talking about 4K TVs, ultra HD, 8K TVs, etc. It’s that technology, and how cheap it is becoming, that’s enabling us to use drones to get highly precise images of what’s going on in our fields, far beyond the capability of what we can see with the human eye. One of the big concepts that I think people on farms need to understand, particularly crop farms, when it comes to drones: The drone is incidental and is simply the best current delivery device we have for getting one centimeter per pixel resolution, which is the minimum requirement in my opinion to spot what’s going on in a farm. Tell me about some of the ways that you want to take that visual information. What would be the practical application? What are some of the things you have in mind? Stand counts are something very useful we can do today. One of the biggest decisions a farmer makes every year is when they plant a field and the crops start emerging. If areas in the field do not emerge, well, what do I do about it? When you can count every individual plant in a field, you can make a data-driven decision as to whether it makes financial sense to re-sow or simply do nothing. I know enough farmers to know how difficult it is for a farmer to sit on their hands and do nothing when they are looking at a big bare patch in the middle of their field. Financially speaking, when it comes to your profit margin, it may actually be the best decision to simply do nothing. Introducing data-driven decision to agriculture, via increased digital measurement, is what enables you to do things like that. Another application we have: Crop maturity analytics is something we can do today. The whole point of that is, when you ask farmers when they harvest their fields, it is generally they are afraid of bad weather coming, so they are going to harvest before the bad weather. If they see the neighbor out or the local agronomist tells them to do it, very little of it is based on data. I heard Aidan Connolly make a great point that today we farm based on what we see happening in our fields or what we see happening with our animals. Increasingly, as agriculture becomes more digitized, we are going to start farming data. We will look at what the data feedback is coming off our farm, and we will be making decisions on our farming activity based on that. You talked about the importance of getting to a sustainable form of agriculture. What are some of the problems that we have, the way we are farming currently? What’s the potential risk for not dealing with it? The potential risk of not dealing with it is our planet dies. That doesn’t mean humans will go extinct or anything like that; it just means that this planet won’t be a very nice place to live. Elon Musk is doing everything he can to get to Mars, but I’m not sure that’s going to be much nicer. When we look at the principal risks that can be dealt with by using digital technologies, number one is our out-of-control nitrogen cycle. Currently, we are spending $140 billion dollars annually on nitrogen fertilizer. Depending on the target plant, 17 to 26 percent of that is being used by the target plant and the rest is being taken up by weeds, getting locked into the soil, or going as runoff into our waterways. We have an inefficiency loop in terms of our nitrogen fertilizer. The difficulty with that in terms of an environmental perspective is, unfortunately, nitrogen fertilizer does a lot of damage to our soil. We are in a situation where we’re putting in more and more fertilizer to get the same results. The only way we are going to break out of that vicious cycle is by getting technology that allows us to apply fertilizer and other chemical inputs on-demand when appropriate to do so, as opposed to just doing blanket hit-and-hope spraying as we do today. Will the application in the future be more directly just to the plant’s root system, or do you think there will be more ways to deliver it more efficiently so it’s not covering the whole field? I really can’t see beyond using robotic applications. DJI Drones has already released a robotic sprayer that can spray sixty acres per hour at $15,000. One of the things we can do is spot very early where there is a problem in your field. Then you identify the problem, and you can send in your precision sprayer to spray the area in the field when it is only impacting a couple of square meters, as opposed to having to spray the entire field when you see it with your own eyes. How do you visually, with a camera, determine where you need nitrogen? I would assume that’s based on plant growth or color? Nitrogen application is not something we can do with visual technology today in a manner that is affordable to a farmer. The best sort of sensor tech to use, to identify where you need nitrogen, is hyperspectral. That is way too expensive to be using at farm level currently. The other thing is, if you do decide to spend the money on something like hyperspectral and look at it at the start of the year, that is only so useful, because your requirements are going to change throughout the growing season. For technology to actually make a meaningful impact, it needs to be cheap enough that you can use it consistently throughout the growing season so you can apply inputs as and when needed by the plant. How will you make It cheaper? If you look at RGB cameras, which are like the cameras in your smartphone or a normal camera, they are getting incredibly cheap, incredibly quickly. Again, so cheap that you have a camera included in your smartphone for free that a professional photographer would have killed for ten years ago. Hyperspectral is the same; the underlying drivers of the cost of that technology are the same for RGB. The reason hyperspectral is so expensive is that an RGB camera looks at three spectra, red, green and blue, and hyperspectral looks at two hundred spectra. Your underlying data cost is obviously a large multiple of the cost associated with an RGB camera, not to mention the cost of the sensor itself. I think you mentioned, aside from the nitrogen cycle, two other big issues with agriculture. Can you talk about those a little bit? Number one, we really need to stop using pesticides as much as we do, because obviously that indiscriminately kills all sorts of things, not just the target pest species. Also, we need to stop farming in monocultures. As I said, one of the technologies we have already developed is precision. We can spot on a grain-by-grain basis when a crop is mature and ready to be harvested. When you can do precision on-demand harvesting, that will enable you to get away from your combine harvester green revolution paradigm, where you have to harvest an entire field in a couple of hours. If you can plant many different species of plants in one field and harvest them on demand when appropriate, that’s a far more environmentally friendly way to farm. In theory, it should also be a more profitable way for a farmer to farm. They are not beholden to the commodity markets in an individual crop. They have greater resilience to commodity markets, certainly, because they have many different crops. One of the other things farmers should also be aware of in the future is there is a big trend creeping in that bio-suitability is arguably the best way to grow things. What I mean by that is, what did nature intend to grow in the area where your farm happens to be? The more you try to force something to grow where nature didn’t intend it to grow, the more chemical inputs and artificial methodologies you are going to need to make that happen. One of the things I think that farmers need to consider in the future is, what should we actually be farming here? What nature intended for us to farm here is going to minimize how many inputs we need to make it happen. There are also going to be more exotic types of farming available to us in the near future. Solar panels are a great example. How many farmers in semi-arid regions would actually be better off having solar farms rather than crop or livestock farms? Similarly, there is a chance we are going to see algae farming developing, so you know if you have a high level of solar activity, you are going to be better off farming algae than farming crops or livestock. I don’t know the answers to these questions, but I do know we are going to have far more options as to what we do with our land as we move further into the future. You mentioned alternative ways to manufacture commodities like milk. Yeah. If you look on a long enough time horizon, we can already see emerging trends. We are starting to create agents of nutritional complexity, as opposed to biological agents of nutritional complexity. What I mean by a biological agent of nutritional complexity is, well, an example of one is a cow. You feed a cow grass, you get milk and beef from that animal when you have just fed it grass. That’s what I mean by an agent of nutritional complexity. We are already starting to see the emergence of synthetic meat. There is synthetic milk, which is a bio-fermentation process including a type of genetically modified yeast that, when you feed it sugars, it excretes something that is molecularly identical to milk rather than excreting alcohol. The other big one is algae. Alltech’s heterotrophic algae facility never ceases to amaze me. I just think it’s one of the most wonderful things I’ve seen. On the best land in the world, if you get 4.5 tons of wheat out of it a year, you are doing well. If you put a heterotrophic algae plant on the worst land in the world, you can get 60 tons of that stuff every nineteen days. The parallel I draw to this is, it’s not dissimilar to where we were in the energy market in the ‘70s. We could see that the future of energy was more than likely going to be nuclear plus solar plus batteries, but we had to make our fossil fuels system more efficient and less environmentally harmful in order to buy us time to get there. We are just about there in the energy market now. When I look at agriculture, I think there is no doubt that if we want to feed 10 billion people by 2050 without destroying our planet, we are going to need stuff like nuclear and solar that give us what we need without depleting our natural resources. I would be arguing that what we are currently trying to do is make a green revolution and agriculture more efficient and more environmentally friendly until we get to such a point that we can actually create edible, tasty and nutritious food that comes out of processes like bio-fermentation, such as synthetic milk and algae. The other big outlier in that, as well, is insect meal. There is a big question of whether synthetic meat will ever be viable for reasons that are quite long so I’m not going to go into them here. But the other big issue with synthetic meat is, insects are able to convert base nutrients into more complex proteins at an eighty percent efficiency level. So any synthetic meat is going to have to beat how efficient insects are already. I get a little frustrated by the lack of adoption of insects in our industry, because they are such a suitable food for chickens and fish as well as humans. The thing I like to say is, when we eat insects from the sea, they command a price premium and are considered a delicacy. Insects that are found on land are considered disgusting, which I really don’t get. That’s a really interesting point, because if you take a really good close look at a shrimp or a crayfish, they are very much like an insect or closely related. Do you eat any land-based insects? I have. They are not that widely available in Ireland or the United States. I have no issue eating them whatsoever. This is where stuff gets a little bit disgusting, but one of the other big things that’s important about heterotrophic algae and insect meal is, you can actually use human faeces to fuel those technologies. Scientifically speaking, there is no problem with that whatsoever, but when people think about that, even though it makes tremendous environmental and ecological sense, that really turns people’s stomachs. If we want to have 10 billion people on this planet, these are the types of solutions we need to think about. We need to make better use of our waste. If we can use our waste to make food with it, I can’t think of a better use case than that. Maybe a starting point is to feed animals with insect protein. I wouldn’t expect us to feed human waste to insects, then eat the insects. When I’m talking about doing that, I mean feed the insects to chickens; then we will eat the chickens. Even feed one group of insects the human waste and feed those insects to other insects, and then we can process those insects with a lot of flavorings and hopefully people will eat them then. It’s very difficult to predict the way these things will go when it’s something quite so disgusting. One last question: How did you name your company, and what does the name mean? We completely over-thought the name, as is our habit. I did Latin for six years, and canthus is the Latin word for the corner of your eye. In Caesar’s propaganda that he used to send back to Rome, he was always winning battles that no one else could win, because he saw things out of the corner of his eye that no one else saw. Then there is a huge artificial intelligence (AI) component to what we do as well, so Cainthus is part canthus and AI. David Hunt spoke at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference.

In this interview, she discussed with David Butler the importance of docosahexaenoic acid, or DHA, and its role in brain function and development. Dr. Lyons highlighted some of the exciting new research that is being done to examine the connection between DHA, sleep quality and attention span in children. We also discussed the pros and cons of fish oil versus algae as a source of DHA. A transcript of the interview follows: This is David Butler for Alltech, and I’m here with Dr. Aoife Lyons. Can you tell us a little bit about your background, please? I’m a licensed clinical psychologist, and my specialty is in children and brain development. I ran a children’s clinic in Chicago for about 14 years where we saw all sorts of children. Many had Attention Deficit Disorder, which is more commonly known as ADHD, and we saw a lot of learning disabilities as well. How long have you been with Alltech? I have been with Alltech as a consultant for about 12 years, full-time now for about two years. Very good. Tell us a little about omega-3 fatty acids and why they are important. Well, DHA, or those fatty acids that you are talking about, are really, really important to support central nervous systems. Your central nervous system is in charge of your brain. It’s in charge of executive functioning, which is things like time management, being able to organize your time, being able to prioritize, having impulse control, things like this. It’s very, very important in children to have DHA to support that brain development, which is happening so rapidly. Also, it’s really important to have DHA through the lifetime, in particular in old age. There is a lot of literature out there that shows supplementation with DHA helps support memory function in patients with Alzheimer’s. So, you talk about DHA and omega-3’s. I think it can be kind of confusing for people when they are looking for supplements and thinking about their diet. What is the difference? Oftentimes when you go to Whole Foods or another health food store, you will see omega-3 fatty acids, and those are coming from fish oil, but when we think about where did the fish get their oil to begin with, it’s from algae. The more pure form of DHA would be from that algae. Alltech has several algae facilities that we’re developing at this point and lots of different uses that we are hoping for. My interest, of course, is in the cognitive development of children. I thought, wow, Alltech is doing this research with DHA and algae, how can we bridge the gap between what Alltech offers scientifically and what my personal interests are, which is in the health of children. There is a lot of research into the importance of DHA, of course, and I’m sure that you have read several studies on it. What are the current focus areas, and what are some of the results? Interestingly enough, most of the studies have been in 2012 and 2013, so this is really a cutting edge in terms of scientific research, into psychology and interbrain development. One study did supplementation through about 300 mg of DHA in children for 16 weeks, and then they asked the parents and the teachers, before and after, to rate the children on different behaviors, such as impulsivity, concentration, attention, these sorts of things. They did see improvement in children after the 16 weeks of supplementation. What is more interesting is that for children with learning disabilities, it seems like the effects of DHA are greater than just more typically developing children. People say, why is this? Again, this is really cutting-edge research. It’s all very very new. There is one interesting study, I believe it was in 2013, that looked at children’s sleep cycles and children with ADHD in particular. They found for all children, supplementation with the DHA for this 16-week cycle, they hooked them up to sleep machines and the whole thing, and what they found is that children were getting on average 57-58 more minutes of sleep per night. Now, this does not mean that the children were in bed for almost an hour more per night. It just meant that they had less episodes of waking up during the night. And then they looked at the children’s attention after the supplementation, and they found that the attention and also their academic skills had improved. Sometimes people will say to me, of course academic skills are going to improve after about four months, of course we’re going to expect reading to be better, and I think something that most people wouldn’t realize is that the tests that we give children, the psychological and academic tests, they are normed to the month so that children who are 7 years, 1 month old, would be compared to children who are 7 years, 1 month. So a child then who is 7 years, 5 months, is compared to other children of the exact same age. So, when we see improvement in reading, it is a true improvement. That sounds like a pretty dramatic difference. Almost an hour of extra quality sleep, and I’m sure anybody that has kids knows that they're easier to get along with if they have better sleep. So what is the next step? Well, again, this is very new research, and a lot of the studies that have been done were done in England. There hasn’t been a lot of literature coming out of the US yet. Small-scale studies, specific to schools or to clinical groups, maybe in a pediatrician’s clinic. What we need are larger-scale studies so we can piece out what exactly is going on with the DHA supplementation and the improved academics and the improved attention. I think that increased knowledge in the public about the benefits of DHA, exactly what it does in the brain to support the central nervous system development, is really important. You know, when you think about it, we’re saying fish oil, and it could have easily been called snake oil many years ago. So I think educating the public is important, so that they are more on board in terms of having their children take part in these sorts of studies. I know for myself, I am taking the fish oil. I know whenever I had researchers Becky Timmons, she takes a lot of fish oil. Her daughter also took fish oil when she was studying for her law school exams. So I think the larger-scale studies will be important, and I would love to see cross-cultural studies. I would love to see if children, say, in Japan, where the diet is more heavily based on fish, see if those children have better attention and concentration than the U.S. children, and is that due to their diet, or is that due to the cultural reasons and expectations that parents have for their child’s behavior? Do you have any plans for your own research coming up? Well, I do, actually. I would love to do another study. A lot of those studies that have been done have been using omega-3 fish oil. I would love to do a study that is just looking at the DHA, just at the algae. We have plans that are underway. We are just in the very early stages at this point. I would love to do a larger scale study with DHA from algae supplementation in a bigger group of school children with the same model as some of the other studies that have been done, but a bigger group of children so we can piece out, does this work for all children? Does this work with kids with ADHD? Does it work better with kids with learning disabilities? So there is a lot of research that can be done. I’m to the point where I have found a couple of schools that are interested in this project, but it wouldn’t get underway until probably a year from now. Let’s suppose that you have two routes for supplementing the DHA and you could either take fish oil or you could take algae. If you had an equal quantity of DHA either way, would there still be advantages to algae? Why would that be preferable over fish oil? Well, in terms of doing research with children, there are all sorts of methodological things that you have to think about. Taking the fish oil capsules is not exactly a pleasant thing, sometimes if you haven’t had breakfast it can make you feel a little sick to your stomach, but we do know that there are some gummy bear algae based DHA products available out there, so that would be one way to go. Try to make it a treat for the kid. If we’re trying to increase the number of people that are improving their diet with DHA, would algae or fish oil be more sustainable method for that? It’s a lot more sustainable to grow a lot of algae than it is to grow the algae to feed the fish to farm the fish. It’s kind of just going to the source instead of taking it one more step. And it also doesn’t taste like fish. Correct. Thank you very much, and good luck with your research. I hope we have the chance to talk to you about that soon.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/dr-aoife-lyons-dha-brain-development-and-recent-research","title":"\n\n                    Dr. Aoife Lyons on DHA, Brain Development and Recent Research\n                    ","date":"March 30, 2017","contentLength":1630}},{"pageContent":"“If a customer is telling you they want something, guess who else they are telling?” professor Robert Wolcott asked the audience at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference (ONE18). “Your competition. So, how do you find out what the customer wants before they want it?” The clinical professor of innovation and entrepreneurship at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University told the attendees of ONE18 the secret to surviving long-term in a disruptive industry. “We must ask better questions,” he said. A business survival guide “We cannot predict the future in detail,” said Wolcott. “But we can provide foresight.” Part of the foresight that accompanies great ideas entails reflecting on the history of what many considered to be the “best” companies over the past few decades. IBM, Xerox and Kodak were just a few of many other corporations that had two things in common: 1) Near death experiences. Each company was on the verge of extinction before reinventing and adapting to its surroundings. 2) They were all “the very best company on the planet for decades,” explained Wolcott. However, history shows that any company is vulnerable to possible extinction. Luckily, Wolcott shared his two tips for how companies can evolve and thrive in ever-changing markets: 1) Fortification: Extend and defend the core business. 2) Exploration: Create growth through exploring future opportunities. A business’ product will not remain the most revolutionary idea to consumers forever. There are other companies that are trying to do things bigger, better and faster. Competition is tough, and top businesses can quickly transition from predators in the industry to prey. “We must rise to the occasion, whether we succeed or not,” encouraged Wolcott. “It is in the attempt that we grow as human beings and as organizations.” Technological trend-setters Wolcott continued his talk by referencing many new technologies and business practices that are shaking up the industry: 1) Electric cars were considered a hassle by consumers for many years. An exaggerated fear of running out of battery in the middle of a busy highway plagued minds of worried potential buyers. However, Wolcott informed the audience that there are electric cars that can travel 1,000 miles before running out of battery. Millions of dollars are being invested in charging stations for easy, convenient plug-ins nationally. Listening to customer needs — and anticipating that there would be resistance to a new technology — resulted in the foresight to create an automobile that doesn’t cause more questions, but instead provides answers. “If we always look in the same places, we will only find the same answers,” said Wolcott. However, is it too late for electric cars? Are self-driving cars the way of the future? 2) For three years, said Wolcott, Amazon has been anticipating the orders of users and stocking them in a nearby warehouse, ready for shipping. Wolcott informed the audience that if a user clicks, or even hovers, over the same product in the online store more than once, Amazon will anticipate that the user is just a few more clicks away from making a purchase. When the customer finally decides to pull the trigger and buy the item they have been eyeing for weeks, Amazon will already have it nearby. “Human beings want what they want, where they want it, when they want it,” said Wolcott. Amazon’s method, called “anticipatory shipping,” is foresight personified. 3) “Today, we have a global supply chain. The larger the plant, the lower your costs,” explained Wolcott. “Over the next 30 years, this model will be destroyed.” He reassured the audience that global supply chain won’t disappear completely, as some will still be vital, but soon, 3D printing will take over. Why would extra tools, resources and employees be necessary to build something over the span of days, weeks or months, when 3D printing could provide it in minutes? “In our lifetimes, we might be able to have a 3D printing machine on our counters,” said Wolcott. So, what are the right questions? According to Wolcott, we are on the right track. The question we are used to asking, Wolcott says, is, “How can this technology help us be better at what we already do?” “This is a great question,” said Wolcott. “Keep asking it. But that’s not enough.” Instead, he challenged everyone with new questions: 1) “What can this technology help us do that we have never done before?” Is it innovative like electric cars? Expedient like anticipatory shopping? Convenient like 3D printing? Wolcott explains that often the right questions come from people investigating their own future. 2) “In a world of increasing technology,” explains Wolcott, “we can do anything. What can we do and why?” What purpose does this new technology serve? Is it making lives easier? Can it grow with time? 3) “Where might the future go?” Is the idea sustainable? Does it keep up with the trends that are found through foresight? But, overall, the foresight needed to survive in an ever-changing industry and to create the next big idea is in search of a very noble cause. “To make the world a better place,” explained Wolcott. “That is what motivates people more than anything else.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/professor-robert-wolcott-are-businesses-asking-right-questions-survive-ever-changing-market","title":"\n\n                    Professor Robert Wolcott: Are businesses asking the right questions to survive in an ever-changing market?\n                    ","date":"May 23, 2018","contentLength":868}},{"pageContent":"Tall fescue (Lolium arundinaceum) is a cool season, perennial bunch grass native to Europe. Since its introduction in the early 1800s, it has spread widely throughout the southeastern and lower midwestern United States. Due in large part to its tolerance for heat and low-quality soils, and its adaptability to a wide range of conditions, tall fescue is now grown on more than 37 million acres of land in the U.S. (Thompson et al., 1993), and it is estimated that more than half of these fields are infected with the fungal endophyte Epichloë coenophiala (Jones et al., 2004). This endophyte provides positive characteristics to the plant, but the secondary metabolites (ergot alkaloids) produced by the endophyte have negative consequences to animals grazing on infected fescue. The positives and negatives of fescue utilization Positives Negatives Drought and heat tolerance Deters insects Disease resistance Increased biomass Reduced weight gain Intolerance to heat Reduced milk production Lower reproductive efficiency Symptoms of tall fescue toxicosis in cattle The pathology of cattle consuming infected tall fescue can vary greatly depending on the weather and alkaloid concentration. The signs most readily apparent to producers include reduced feed intake (up to 50 percent) and weight gain, decreased milk production, reduced reproductive efficiency, tissue necrosis and a rough hair coat. Collectively, this range of conditions is known as “fescue toxicosis.” The decrease in productivity caused by fescue toxicosis has been estimated to cost U.S. beef producers more than $2 billion per year due to reduced growth, diminished reproductive efficiency and market discrimination because of unthrifty appearance (Kallenboch, 2015). Consumption of the ergot alkaloids in endophyte-infected tall fescue results in widespread vasoconstriction in cattle. This reduces the ability of the animal to dissipate heat, resulting in a variety of physiological symptoms, including increased respiration rate and elevated core temperature. This reduction in tolerance to heat leads to less time spent grazing and reduced weight gains, generally called “summer slump.” In colder months, the vasoconstriction from fescue can combine with natural vasoconstriction related to thermoregulation, resulting in tissue death in extremities such as ear tips, tails and feet, commonly known as “fescue foot.” The vasoconstriction also reduces blood flow to the rumen, decreasing volatile fatty acidy (VFA) absorption. Consumption of ergot alkaloids also reduces passage rates of digesta from the rumen, likely by reducing rumen motility. These alterations work together to reduce nutrient availability, contributing to the reduced growth rate frequently observed in cattle grazing fescue. Don't let fescue toxicity affect your herd's profitability As much as 75 percent of the economic losses attributed to infected tall fescue are related to decreased calving rates. It is estimated that tall fescue consumption has averaged a loss of $160 per cow annually since 2005 (Kallenboch, 2015). Several of the ergot alkaloids have structural similarities to dopamine and act as dopamine agonists, reducing prolactin secretion from the pituitary gland. This translates to reduced mammary development and lower milk production. Alkaloid consumption also alters several other hormones important to reproductive efficiency, including progesterone and estradiol. When combined with vasoconstriction to the uterus and ovaries, this exacerbates heat-related reductions in reproductive efficiency seen in cattle grazing fescue during summer months. I would like more information on fescue and Alltech solutions for beef cattle.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/tall-fescue-grassland-quandary-beef-cattle","title":"\n\n                    Tall fescue: A grassland quandary for beef cattle\n                    ","date":"July 12, 2018","contentLength":544}},{"pageContent":"During mid-February in many areas of the United States, children could be heard laughing and playing outside, but instead of sledding down hills and building snowmen, they were playing baseball. Cherry trees and dogwoods were beginning to bud, and the grass would soon need to be mowed. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has decreed this winter (December 2016–February 2017) as the sixth warmest on record. While the conditions have been warm and dry in the Midwest, California and the western part of the U.S. have experienced a very wet winter that has resulted in widespread flooding, a mixed blessing for an area that has been under drought conditions for several years. What does this wild weather mean for growers? Early warm weather can increase pressure from various sources: Diseases that may survive the season if the ground does not freeze Insects that can find a ready food source in early emerging crops Early weed growth that could mean an increase in weed population, decreasing the ability of the crop to establish itself Cool, wet soil that can hinder seed germination and increase the probability of mold Soil compaction caused by machinery being used on wet soils during early planting can decrease nutrient availability and reduce drainage and the ability for adequate rooting Possibilities of late-season freezes that can damage new planting and early growth What should growers do in early warm weather conditions? Increasing the organic matter and availability of nutrients can help decrease the effects of soil compaction and help the soil bounce back more quickly. Healthier soil will provide a solid foundation for improved plant health, enabling the crop to better resist damage from frost and disease. Frequent scouting and prompt field testing will allow the grower to more effectively manage weed, insect and disease pressure and prevent any issues from becoming widespread.

During her presentation at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference, Comstock said that the key is to shift your mindset. “It really comes down to this one thing,” she said. “You have to imagine a future that few others can see, and then you have to take action to make it happen.” Everyone, she emphasized, is capable of exactly that if you follow these three tips: 1. Change starts with giving yourself permission “Change isn’t really the scary part,” said Comstock. “It’s that most of us don’t know how to handle change.” The thing that is holding us back? Fear. In today’s hyperconnected world, in which we often focus more on efficiency than on creativity, she said we have to move forward without knowing all the answers. A critical part of the problem is something that Comstock calls the “imagination gap,” where “possibility goes to die.” Our search for greater efficiency and perfection has developed an almost mechanical work culture that fears creativity and failure. Not only is “failure” a word we refuse to talk about in our organizations — 75 percent of people say they do not feel creative at work — it is putting pressure on children as well, a time when developing imagination is critical. Comstock believes this imagination gap is holding us back by crowding out the very human nature of us. “Everyone’s job is now change,” she said. “You can’t delegate it. You have to understand it starts with you.” The number one way to shift your mindset and achieve change is to give yourself, and your teams, permission to change, including trying and testing new things. This includes giving yourself permission to fail. Comstock has even given herself and her team members physical “permission slips” to express fear and give themselves permission to try things that might not work. Importantly, this permission also includes giving feedback to other team members to foster accountability. “Feedback is oxygen for a change-ready mindset,” she said. “Seek it. Give it. Use it.” What do you fear? Pinpointing that fear, and engaging with it head-on, is the first step to creating and better adapting to change. 2. Make room for discovery “You have to lead with curiosity,” said Comstock. “You have to see for yourself.” To do so, she suggests “wallowing” in an idea, which includes getting to know your team members, your market and where change is happening, as well as spotting trends. She also urges investigating points of view that contradict your own and going on journeys of discovery with your entire team. As someone who loves patterns, Comstock recommends looking for connections and following her “going on 3’s” rule: If you spot an occurrence of something new three times, it may be a trend that is worth paying attention to, such as video streaming and the craft beer movement. Ten percent of your time, she said, is spent on what you already know. Instead, we should be focusing that time on creating something new. “Most people think they don’t have the time, that this isn’t their job,” said Comstock. An easy, business school-based breakdown of how you might spend your time more innovatively might look like this, she said: 70 percent on core innovations, or the projects on which you are already focusing 20 percent on what’s next, or today’s fresh, new ideas (e.g., CRISPR gene-editing technology) 10 percent on what’s new, or the ideas that have the potential to change the world five, 10 or 20 years from now Even though 10 percent might not sound like much, taking even this small amount of time to look beyond the status quo and innovate new ideas can reap big rewards. “What’s your 10 percent?” asked Comstock, inviting the audience to identify time that they could spend thinking innovatively. “I know you have it! How are you going to liberate your teams to go out and discover?” 3. Embed learning — and failure — into your operating system We must engage the world as our classroom, and the way to do so is to change our work culture, including the words we use and the actions we take. “Learning cultures require that you put more questions into the system than answers,” said Comstock. One of the most powerful outcomes of promoting continuously learning and empowering your team, she said, is finding out that there are many entrepreneurs in your organization. Find these people who are not afraid to make messes and support them in creating new ideas — and allowing them to kill those ideas when they simply are not ready. At General Electric, Comstock applied this method in the wider community as well, partnering with local startups to solve a critical appliance problem. By “open sourcing” the problem, she explained that you can narrow your window of risk, bring integrated teams together and create more options so that when change arrives, you can be more confident about what ideas are appropriate to scale. Not only should learning be a key element of work culture — so should failure. “If failure isn’t an option,” said Comstock, “neither is success.” She encourages inviting your team to share what went wrong with an idea, what they learned and how they plan to make it better moving forward. In order to be truly ready for change, we need more people with imagination to fight for the future, despite fear of failure. Imagination isn’t a glitch, she said. In fact, it’s our best feature. “I’m a beginner,” admitted Comstock. “I don’t have the answer yet — I don’t even know what the question is. But I’m committed to figuring it out.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/beth-comstock-3-strategies-beat-your-fear-failure-and-meet-change-head","title":"\n\n                    Beth Comstock: 3 strategies to beat your fear of failure and meet change head-on\n                    ","date":"May 22, 2018","contentLength":1025}},{"pageContent":"“The judicious use and reduction of antibiotics in poultry production is here to stay,” said Dr. Kayla Price, poultry technical manager for Alltech Canada, in a recent webinar. In the last few years, we have seen an influx of products being marketed as alternatives to antibiotics.

This functional foods market was already estimated at $129.39 billion in 2015, and a compound annual growth rate of 7.8 percent is expected through 2021. Strengthening this trend is a major demographic change taking place: the boomer generation is aging. By the year 2050, 30 percent of the U.S. population will be 65 years of age and older, and a similar demographic trend is expected in other regions of the world. Currently, life expectancy at birth is 78.9 years, a significant increase over the past 40 years due to advances in medical care and nutrition. This means more people are experiencing the aging process, which brings with it a series of changes and a decline in body functions, such as eyesight, hearing, taste, mobility, memory and cognition. This is due to an accumulation of damage to cells, tissues and organs, occurring over time from changes in hormonal regulation, wear and tear, and free radical production, among others. One of the resulting conditions, cognitive impairment among older people, may place a tremendous burden on public health. Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disease. It affects 5.3 million Americans 65 years of age and older, and that number is expected to quadruple by the year 2050 with a cost of over $1.1 trillion to the U.S. alone. Can Fido come to the rescue?: Similarities between senior pet and human nutrition As it is with humans, the pet population is also living longer due to better nutrition and veterinary care. It is estimated that 45 percent of dog parents have a dog aged 7 and older, while 46 percent of cat parents have a cat aged 7 and older. A number of studies in the past 15 years provide evidence indicating similarities between man and his best friend as far as cognitive-behavioral skills are concerned, particularly in later stages of life. These studies suggest that cognitive decline in the aging canine is remarkably similar to that of human aging and dementia. In humans, AD involves the accumulation of senile plaques called beta amyloid (AB) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Canines develop AB lesions but not full-blown NFT. In addition, free radicals or reactive oxygen species (ROS) from mitochondrial dysfunction may cause deleterious effects in neurons both in canines and humans. In the canine model, the use of antioxidants and mitochondrial cofactors, such as carnitine, alpha lipoic acid and alpha-tocopherol, showed improved cognition and reduced neuropathology in aged dogs. The beneficial effects of fish consumption are well-known in human health. Several studies in elderly people indicate that supplementation with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) has a protective association against cognitive decline. Similarly, DHA supplementation in the canine model also shows improvement in cognitive learning in aged dogs. More recently, there is strong evidence coming from a number of selenium yeast studies, indicating that selenium yeast plays an important role in reducing the beta-amyloid burden and minimizing DNA and RNA oxidation, which can assist in preventing age-related neuropathologies associated with cognitive decline. There is no silver bullet that will provide a solution to the preservation of cognitive function through life. What is clear, however, is that the nutritional tools we have available can help us forge a magnificent shield to fight against cognitive decline in both the human senior and his best friend.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/aging-brains-nutrition-human-senior-and-his-best-friend","title":"\n\n                    Aging brains: Nutrition for the human senior and his best friend\n                    ","date":"March 4, 2017","contentLength":588}},{"pageContent":"“Raising kids isn’t that hard…right?” says someone who has clearly never parented a child before. But is parenting harder than raising healthy calves? Try having that argument with a producer who has 400 individual cow-calf pairs — not just one or two kids — in the middle of calving season. From the stress to the unpredictability to the effect on his or her bottom line, calving is undoubtedly tough. But the reality is that it’s not fair to compare the two. Parenting children and raising calves are incredible gifts and incredible challenges. But why do some calves and some kids turn out well while others do not? Is it luck? Or is it something else? Many beef producers attribute a good batch of calves to favorable weather, a strong market or a list of other factors. Parents, meanwhile, spare no detail (or expense) in attempting to raise healthy and successful kids. Is it possible for us to pull some truths from parenting that apply to raising calves? Parenting truths that (wildly enough) also apply to cattle 1) Kids (and calves) need a nurturing environment. From the moment a mom-to-be learns that a baby is on the way, everything in her life begins to change as plans are made for the newest addition to the family. A bedroom is prepared, a crib is set up and everything the mom eats and drinks is taken into account to prepare for the baby. Parents do all that they can to protect their child and establish a good foundation so he or she can be as healthy and strong as possible. The same logic can and should be applied to calving. First, from a management standpoint, everything needs to be done to assure the comfort and safety of the cow. This means providing sufficient bedding, creating a clean, bad bacteria-limiting environment and reducing external stresses at all costs for the sake of the new calf. Nutrition is a second critical component of any healthy calving program. Similar to how many moms-to-be take prenatal vitamins, a quality mineral and nutritional program — especially in the final four to six weeks of pregnancy — is key to delivering quality calves. Technologies such as Bioplex®, Sel-Plex®, Bio-Mos® and Actigen® can all play a central role in a healthy cow-calf management program. Bioplex and Sel-Plex are organic trace minerals formulated to promote the optimal mineral status for cows, which is critical for ensuring immunity and the adequate transfer of nutrients to the calf. Additionally, Bio-Mos and Actigen are industry-leading technologies used to optimize gut health and promote good bacteria both in cows and their calves. A healthy gut in the cow leads to improved colostrum quality, the all-important first drink for calves that can jumpstart their natural health defense and support overall immunity. Particularly during the first 24–72 hours of a calf’s life, when it must absorb whole proteins, reinforcing nutrient status through technologies like Bio-Mos and Actigen can promote life-long health, which is good news for both the cow and the calf. 2) Even when times are tough, parents (and producers) must trust the process. There’s a reason they call it the “terrible twos,” and most parents vividly remember their kid’s first out-of-control public temper tantrum. The kicking, the screaming, the unwanted stares from other parents — those moments are intense (especially for a first-time parent), but they can provide insight for cow-calf producers. Parents know this behavior is all part of growing up and requires dedicated, steady and loving parenting. Every few years, it seems the market for cattle hits a peak high or an all-time low. In both the high and low moments (like when a kid is screaming in public), it is important to remember the impact of tried-and-tested methods, not just the latest fad or quick fix, to drive long-term profitability. One factor for success in cattle production is using comprehensively researched feed ingredients like Bio-Mos and Actigen. Reviewed in over 734 accredited studies in all production animal species, Bio-Mos and Actigen have more than 20 years of market presence to back their ability to promote both health and profitable returns. By being proactive and utilizing nutrition as a management tool, much like good parenting strategies, an overall platform for success can be created. 3) Kids don’t magically turn into adults at age 18. Calves aren’t automatically ready for the feed yard. Every parent’s “special little guy or girl” doesn’t simply wake up as a healthy, smart, successful adult on his or her 18th birthday. Every successful adult was molded and nurtured every day for 18 years by those around him or her, especially their parents, before being sent off into the world. Interestingly, the world of cattle production can and should function the same way. The goal of cow-calf production is to generate healthy, strong calves that can perform well when they are sent off for feedlot production, much as young adults are prepped in school to enter the workforce. For cattle about to enter the feed yard, this may take shape in a few different ways. Nutritionally, it can be reinforced by developing a strong mineral program throughout the calf’s life, especially during the weaning and backgrounding stages, with technologies like Bioplex and Sel-Plex. A strong mineral base prepares cattle for the new feedlot environment and ensures that they produce profitably. Furthermore, management issues, such as shipping stress, can be accounted for by supplementing the diet with electrolytes to reinforce receiving status. The connection between calves and kids/producer and parent is closer than we think. As producers, we provide some of the healthiest, best-tasting beef we can for our communities, friends and families. We also desire to feed and nurture children in such a way that they can grow up to become healthy, productive adult members of society. Let’s continue to raise our cattle and kids with the kind of care that benefits us both today and for generations to come.

Growing up, I took every opportunity I could to ride and simply be around horses. I was the stereotypical horse-obsessed little girl. And, like many adult amateur riders, I never grew out of that so-called “phase.” I rode mostly Western in those days, and back then I probably never gave my own safety a second thought. Undoubtedly, I realized that horses were quite large and capable of being dangerous, and I had experienced my fair share of falls and close calls to prove it. Most notably, I recall being rushed to the ER after a young horse I was riding bucked me off at speed in an open field, where I fell face-first onto the ground. I wound up with a severe concussion, hysterical parents and a CT scan of my brain. There were no lasting effects that I am aware of. I was one of the lucky ones. I was young and fearless, to an extent, so I never really questioned the overall lack of helmet use. In fact, the only time I was ever required to wear a helmet in my youth was when I attended a local horse camp. Older and, arguably, wiser Fast-forward to present day, when I would call myself a true helmet advocate. Maybe it’s because I ride English now, because the barn I ride at requires helmet usage or because I’m older and have a heightened sense of my own fragility. Perhaps it simply boils down to being better-educated. Either way, I can honestly say I feel far more confident about my personal safety each time I mount up, knowing I have the proper protection for the most precious part of my body. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), horseback riding is the leading cause of traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) among sports-related recreational activities (TBIs occur when an external force injures the brain). The CDC also reports that an estimated 1.7 million Americans sustain a TBI each year. A brain injury can happen to anyone at any given time; it does not discriminate. And one brain injury is all it takes to potentially cause permanent damage to your reflexes and attention, among other serious issues. Experience won’t protect you Only an estimated 20 percent of equestrians wear protective headgear every time they ride. Excuses run the gamut, from concerns about messing up riders’ hair to being very experienced and therefore having no need for a helmet. I don’t know about you, but I’m far more concerned with messing up my brain than my hair. Additionally, more experience in the saddle directly correlates to an increased likelihood of suffering from a riding-related injury. Top-level professional riders (Silva Martin and Courtney King-Dye are probably the most notable recent examples) have suffered TBIs from horse-related accidents. Ultimately, the level of rider has nothing to do with the risk when it comes to these types of injuries. Risk is directly tied to cumulative riding time rather than level of expertise. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that there are currently 1 billion people living on Earth who have some type of brain injury. Millions live with lasting physical and/or emotional effects. Lifetime costs for an acute head injury are in the multi-million-dollar range, and the injured party is not the only one impacted. Families are faced with an uphill climb to aid in rehabilitation and often feel they’ve lost the person they once knew. The effects are truly devastating. Horses: predictably unpredictable It sounds like we should perhaps consider giving up this hobby, right? After all, it’s been proven time and again that horseback riding is one of the most dangerous sports out there. However, I certainly wouldn’t suggest giving up something that so many of us are so deeply passionate about. I think we are all well-aware of the inherent risks associated with equestrian sport. Despite this, I think we can all benefit from taking at least some general precautions: Wear an American Society for Testing and Materials/Safety Equipment Institute (ASTM/SEI) Certified helmet. These can be purchased for as little as USD$25. Make sure your helmet fits properly! This is very important, as an ill-fitting helmet will not properly protect your head in a fall. The brim should sit about an inch above your eyebrows and be level across. You should feel even pressure around your head. The chin strap should be tight but comfortable. Do not wear helmets made for other sports. Riding helmets are made specifically to withstand a fall from a considerable height or a blow from a hoof. Always replace your helmet after a fall, even if you don’t see any visible damage. It will not be as effective at protecting you in future if it has sustained a fall. Replace your helmet at least every five years (sooner if you ride often). Much like your favorite pair of riding breeches, your helmet will get worn out with prolonged use. Can TBIs happen even when you are wearing a helmet? Certainly. Grand Prix dressage rider Silva Martin is living proof. She suffered a brain bleed in March of 2014 after the horse she was riding tripped, causing her to hit her head on his neck before falling to the ground. Nonetheless, she credits her helmet with saving her life that day, and she has now become an outspoken advocate of helmet use. Consider this: The average riding horse weighs 1,100 pounds and can travel at speeds of up to 40 miles per hour. Horses are flight animals, which means they can — and almost certainly will — spook at trivial things. Even the calmest, most “bomb-proof” of horses have their moments of insecurity. It comes naturally. And when you consider that a rider is perched at a substantial distance from the ground when in the saddle, it is unsurprising that head injuries are so common. But I believe we can do something about that. Let’s all “mind our melons,” wear our helmets every time we ride and do our part to make TBIs in equestrian sport a far smaller statistic. I would like to learn more about equine-related topics.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/mind-your-melon-why-equestrians-should-always-wear-helmet","title":"\n\n                    Mind your melon: Why equestrians should always wear a helmet\n                    ","date":"September 17, 2017","contentLength":1065}},{"pageContent":"There is a global movement to reduce antimicrobial use in livestock production. Antimicrobials have historically been, and are still, used extensively to address gut health issues in piglets, and a major challenge is finding alternatives to antimicrobials in order to support the gut during the period when it is developing. The goal to reduce antimicrobial use should be modified and instead viewed as a goal to produce healthy production systems that support the animal in all stages of production. In-feed prophylactic antibiotic use in pig production is not used to treat sick pigs — it is used to treat suboptimal production systems. In the Alltech Antibiotic Reduction programme, the first step is therefore to optimise the health of the production system, which will make systematic prophylactic use redundant. Such an approach will not result in increased disease and loss in productivity; on the contrary, productivity will most likely increase, and the reduced expenditures on antibiotics can be invested in other areas in order to optimize the overall welfare and health of the pigs. A healthy gut is key to a healthy animal, and, increasingly, emphasis is being placed on optimising gut health in our production animals. A healthy gut is not only a gut without disease; a healthy gut is an effective digestive organ that can mount a good defence against disease and easily cope with change. Immunity is the body’s internal defence against pathogens. The presence of disease-causing microorganisms in the gut is not sufficient to cause disease; disease occurs once the pathogen breaks down the gut’s defence. When the gut commensal microflora is out of balance, dysbiosis occurs between the beneficial microbiota and potential disease-causing organisms, and it becomes easier for pathogens to damage the gut’s structures and functions. Prebiotics, probiotics and mannan-oligosaccharides can assist the gut in adapting and minimising dysbiosis. The establishment and maintenance of good gut function are vitally important in reducing neonatal morbidity and mortality. Neonatal nutrition is a critical component in the establishment of normal gut function, from digestion and absorption to barrier function and the development of the immune system. It is therefore important to ensure good colostrum and milk production in sows as well as good creep feeding. Weaning disorders are one of the most common, and damaging, problems in pig husbandry, resulting in antibiotics being used post-weaning to protect the stressed gut and immune systems of the piglets. In a healthy production system, it is essential to do everything possible in order to help prepare the piglet for weaning as early as in the farrowing unit. Furthermore, at the time of weaning, it is important to minimise stressors such as transport, comingling of litters, large weaner groups, diet, poor air quality and unhygienic conditions. Mycotoxins are toxins produced from moulds that cause serious health problems in pig production and can result in severe economic losses worldwide. Due to current climatic conditions and production systems with long distribution chains of feed, the risks associated with mycotoxins in feed and bedding material are high. Intestinal cells are the first cells to be exposed to mycotoxins, and often at higher concentrations than other tissues. Mycotoxins specifically target cells, such as gut epithelium, that have a high protein turnover and protein-activated cells. In order to improve the overall health status of the herd, appropriate measures need to be taken to minimise the exposure of pigs to mycotoxins, particularly in terms of feed storage, feed sourcing and the inclusion of good broad-spectrum mycotoxin binders in the feed. The aim of the Alltech Antibiotic Reduction programme is to create a consistently healthy pig and make prophylactic and metaphylaxis antibiotic use redundant. This programme can assist the farmer in developing an action plan. Various feed additives and nutritional solutions are valuable tools for gut health in pig production, but these supplements alone are not sufficient for a healthy production system. Many times, there are more difficult steps that must be taken than simply feeding additives, including updates to management routines and resource allocation and needs. The programme is for pig producers who are interested in achieving higher levels of health in their herd and are committed to taking steps to achieve these goals. Audits to establish the baseline current situation and recurrent audits to monitor progress are important in order to stay motivated and continue a steady rate of progress. The Alltech team assesses the weaknesses and strengths of the production system and sets up an action plan. In addition to gut health and nutrition components, the Alltech Antibiotic Reduction programme audits include evaluations of performance, pig welfare, pig respiratory and systemic health, reproductive performance, management, housing, antimicrobial use, biosecurity and the cost-effectiveness of production. Recommendations include nutritional solutions, management, antimicrobial use strategy, biosecurity measures, reproductive performance and productivity goals in order to optimise pig health at all stages of production. Through this program, producers have not only achieved increased productivity and reduced antibiotic use, but have also found it rewarding to be part of the global action plan to use our valuable antibiotics responsibly in order to ensure their viability for future generations.

In a region where farmland is measured in square feet, fried crickets are a delicacy and roadside markets are more common than supermarkets, we experienced many firsts, and our eyes were opened to the differences in agriculture between Canada and Southeast Asia. We arrived in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, ironically on the inaugural Canada’s Agriculture Day, and so we shared our #AgMoreThanEver pride from the other side of the world. Over the next few days, we toured around rural areas, visiting a rubber tree plantation, an agriculture research park where they were growing cabbage, melons and peppers, an earthworm farm and a dairy. After an eye-opening experience traveling through Vietnam, we flew to Thailand to finish our study tour. We visited the Baan Susan Chamchoen Farm, owned by Mr. Somsak, outside of Bangkok. He toured us through his mixed fruit farm, which he built for agri-tourism, with lodging, a restaurant and a store to purchase many value-added products, including syrups and jams. He grows bananas, coconuts and mangos and raises ducks, chickens and goats. We thanked Mr. Somsak for his hospitality with an Ag More Than Ever t-shirt and a Canadian flag.

The Leavenworth Livestock Research Center officially opened in August 2017 Located near Sleepy Eye, Minnesota, the LLRC boasts two 1,250-head rooms and is fully equipped with 96 pens (48 per room) and innovative technologies like the Big Dutchman DryExact feeding system. This automated feeding system brings a higher degree of accuracy to feed delivery records at the feeder level, which results in more statistically significant information. This is essential because big differences in treatments aren’t always observed. However, small differences can add up over time. For example, 1 ounce per day (30 grams) difference in feed delivered equals 7 pounds at market in a wean-to-finish facility. And, while the LLRC may look similar to a commercial barn, it is fully filtered. The modern filtration system removes dust and pathogens before they get into the barn, thereby alleviating many biosecurity concerns. Improving research, production and the producer’s bottom line “Hubbard Feeds has a long history of providing research-proven nutrition programs,” reflects Ernie Hansen, manager of swine nutrition and technical services at Hubbard. “In the early days, we had the Hubbard Answer Farm. More recently, we’ve worked with swine industry leaders such as New Fashion Pork and Compart Family Farms. And today, as part of the Alltech family of companies, we have the unique opportunity to evaluate new nutritional technologies developed by Alltech in a barn that features the latest in design and feeding equipment.” A new group of pigs (sourced from local Minnesota premier pork producer Schwartz Farms, Inc.) was introduced to the LLRC in mid-November 2017 and the Hubbard team began conducting a research trial on Blueprint®, an Alltech program. The goal of this trial is to confirm the cumulative effects of Alltech technologies on growth, health and meat quality. “The opportunity to do research in a realistic commercial production scenario is exciting,” says Hansen. “Our team can gather large amounts of statistical data with the number of pigs on-site and connect those results to similar situations for swine producers. The resulting information from the trials will be used to develop new products and feeding programs, with the overall goal of helping our customers achieve their production goals, increase profitability, reduce risk and improve their overall competitive advantage.” Future research plans at LLRC include: Further evaluation of Alltech technologies in swine feeding programs. Continued assessment of basic nutrition principles such as amino acids, ratios and energy as they evolve with genetics. Animal protein-free and antibiotic-free programs. As the saying goes, the only constant is change. The swine industry of the future will face many challenges and opportunities. “Providing research-proven feeding programs is a big part of the value we bring to our customers,” says Hansen. “It’s why they do business with us. We need to anticipate our customers’ needs and rise to the challenge in order to improve.” For more information on this facility and the research work that’s being done, contact Ernie.Hansen@hubbardfeeds.com.

A menace is lurking, evading citrus growers’ best attempts to keep it at bay and preserve their livelihood and the world’s favorite breakfast beverage. The perpetrators are small, no bigger than an eighth of an inch, but they are mighty. The Asian citrus psyllid is responsible for transmitting a bacterial disease called Huanglongbing, better known as citrus greening. What is citrus greening? As the Asian citrus psyllid feeds on the phloem sap of the citrus trees, the Huanglongbing (HLB) bacteria can be injected. Phloem cells are responsible for transporting nutrients, sugars and metabolites throughout the plant, thus providing the bacteria with a carbon-rich food source. Typical citrus greening symptoms include blotchy mottle characterized by random patterns of asymmetrical yellowing on the leaves. In addition, the fruit are often reduced in size, fail to color properly, are misshapen, abscise from the tree prematurely and are bitter in taste. As the disease progresses, root growth is suppressed, there is twig dieback and, eventually, tree mortality occurs. Although some varieties of citrus show tolerance to the disease, there is no real resistance. Mature trees that become infected can take years to show symptoms, adding to the complexity of disease management. Citrus greening is one of the oldest and most serious citrus diseases. While the disease was first reported in China in 1919, it did not appear in Florida until 2005. Why should citrus greening concern you? All commercial citrus species are susceptible to greening, and it has been reported that over 80 percent of citrus in Florida is infected. Florida accounts for over 49 percent of citrus production in the U.S. and is one of the world’s largest contributors to the citrus juice industry. As the top agricultural sector for the state, Florida’s citrus industry provides over 76,000 full- and part-time jobs. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that citrus production in Florida decreased by 16 percent during the 2015–2016 season over the previous year. This is in addition to the continual decline in year-over-year production, with decreases ranging from 4–16 percent on any given year, that the state has been seeing since 2005. With the decrease in citrus acreage and the loss in number of production trees, Florida’s economy is being threatened. This decline could mean more sparse grocery shelves for orange juice and higher prices for consumers. How is the citrus industry fighting citrus greening? In an attempt to prevent the spread of the disease, the U.S. government has placed a federal order on the quarantine of citrus plants and plant parts, excluding fruit, from leaving Florida without specific approval and proof of treatment against the Asian citrus psyllid. The USDA is also investing millions of dollars into research against the disease. The research spans several studies, including those that look into possible bactericides and finding resistant citrus varieties. Currently, growers are using scouting, tree removal, nutrition and pesticidal programs to manage the disease. Alltech Crop Science is working with growers in Florida, investigating possible ways of combating citrus greening. Research is being conducted to investigate the impact of nutritional inputs as well as to identify how this disease impacts defense genes within infected trees.

As a sixth-generation farmer, this is a well-practiced ritual for Tucker. “We go back about five years in the records,” says Tucker, who uses this data not only to keep track of how his fields have been producing throughout the years, but also to plan what varieties of corn, soybean, wheat and tobacco he will plant the following year. “We normally don’t plant one variety for more than two years,” he explains. He notes that available seed varieties tend to change every few years, which he enjoys because “it keeps you on top of your varieties and what each of them will do.” Farm management pragmatism Tucker is very pragmatic in his approach to his farm management. “My income depends on the weather,” he says. “It depends on the rain and depends on the sunshine, and it doesn’t make a difference what crop you’re talking about.” Even so, Tucker never lets his crops want for anything that is within his control. He makes his decisions on crop inputs based on his expectations for the year. For example, if it is expected to be a rainy year, he knows that the disease potential will be high and adjustments will need to be made to better prepare the crop to fight against those diseases. Balancing technological investment with the bottom line Keeping up with technology is another important factor for Tucker. “We’ve adapted to the technology,” says Tucker. “We are a very open-minded farm and are willing to give new products a try. We have to be in order to be profitable and sustainable for the future.” While he extols the virtues of being progressive, Tucker cautions that “you have to draw a line between how much money you’re going to spend to keep up with the times and still be able to feed your family.” For the love of the farm When asked what stands out to him after his many years of farming, Tucker smiles as he says, “You have to want it. You have to want to spend 20 hours in the tractor, or the combine, or the sprayer. You have to want to do everything you can to have your crop do well.” Those long hours and hard work have a very rewarding outcome. “My most favorite thing is to be able to raise a family on the farm,” says Tucker, recalling picnic lunches and suppers on the field. “You work hard, and when the work is done, you can play hard.” Tucker’s matter-of-fact tone belies his passion for his vocation. “It’s our livelihood; it’s what we do.” Have a question or comment?","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/grower-spotlight-ray-tucker","title":"\n\n                    Grower spotlight: Ray Tucker\n                    Have a question or comment?","date":"February 28, 2018","contentLength":476}},{"pageContent":"A postgraduate student at the Institute of Technology, Carlow in Ireland, Richard Lally’s research on plant growth promotion won him first place at the graduate level of the 2016 Alltech Young Scientist (AYS) program. In addition to global recognition at the ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference, he took home $10,000 and secured a two-year fully-funded postdoctoral contract with Alltech. “It has been one of the most exciting and enjoyable experiences of my life and has been my greatest achievement to date,” said Lally. Lally noted that he has been overwhelmed by messages of support, which he is still receiving to this day. It has touched him and made him very emotional that people cared so much about him and the work he is doing. Lally spoke of his pride in representing not only his college, but his village and country. He credited the other three finalists from the postgraduate section and said they are all exceptional scientists. “To have been selected overall award winner is a real privilege for me, considering their excellent research and talents,” he said. Lally received his undergraduate degree in bioscience with an emphasis in biopharmaceuticals in 2012. He is currently in the process of completing a Ph.D. in environmental biotechnology and bacterial genetics. Lally’s research has been on plant growth-promoting bacteria. “These bacteria produce mechanisms as part of their normal cellular metabolism,” said Lally. “The mechanisms help protect plants against disease, benefit soil nutrient availability, produce plant growth hormones and can relieve plant stress.” He focused on three Pseudomonas fluorescens bacterial strains and their symbiotic relationship with bio-fuel and the food crop rapeseed oil. “I examined the plant growth promotion potential of the three bacterial strains, determining how they colonize and increase plant biomass,” he said. The current use of “agri-chemicals” can negatively impact climate, ecology and water resources in addition to being threatening to human health. Lally’s research aims to provide alternative solutions. “This area of research is deemed relevant in sustainable agriculture, and the bacterial treatments (or biofertilizers) have the potential to reduce the application of agricultural chemicals,” he said. He believes his research will provide new insights into the genetics of plant growth promoters, how they interact with plants and their field potential for crop production. “I hope overall to contribute to the understanding of plant growth-promoting bacteria and their role in sustainable agricultural practices,” said Lally. Lally is currently finalizing his Ph.D. thesis and preparing papers to be submitted for peer review. Once Lally receives his Ph.D., he will begin his postdoctorate research with Alltech. Lally wants to further broaden his skills in biotechnology, sustainable agriculture and research. “I now wish to apply my skill set to a constructive and innovative working environment,” said Lally. “I have many ideas that I wish to work toward experimenting with in the future.” After Lally completes his time with Alltech, he plans to get a job in which he can contribute to the education and development of others. He’s thankful for the people who surrounded him on this journey and credit them for where he is today. “Ultimately, a dream job for me would be a job that I can develop in, help others develop through, one that is satisfying to work in and, of course, one that makes me happy,” said Lally.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/meet-richard-lally-graduate-winner-2016-alltech-young-scientist-award","title":"\n\n                    Meet Richard Lally, graduate winner of the 2016 Alltech Young Scientist award\n                    ","date":"July 25, 2016","contentLength":563}},{"pageContent":"When you go out to your dairy, stop, look and listen to your cows. There are clear cues as to their comfort, and they can tell you if something is wrong with their environment. Three elements of a productive cow’s environment The freestall: Brisket locator: The brisket locator’s purpose is to comfortably position the cow to lie down in the stall. Without the brisket locator or enough sand, the cow can become positioned too far forward in the stall, which can cause injury and deposit manure in the back of the stall rather than the alley. When I see manure on either side of a stall instead of directly behind it, it tells me the cows are angling themselves and trying to adapt to a stall that has not been adjusted properly. Neck rail: The purpose of the neck rail is to position the cow so that when she stands up, she backs up a few inches to defecate in the alley. Deterrent strap: It should be a nylon strap, 4–6 inches wide. It should deter the cows but not injure them. A cable should not be used, as it can cause significant injury. Stall size: Many barns still have stalls that were manufactured in the 1990s. Today, we have larger animals that require larger stalls. We need to set our stall measurements based on the size of our cows, and it needs to be one cow per stall. We want the cows to have ample room to lie down and achieve optimal blood flow. If a cow does not have enough room, she may perch in the alley, and that’s where we can see an increase in hoof rot. Even a few inches of space can make a major difference in hoof condition and milk production. Sand: Sand needs to be clean and dry. Water: ​Milk is 87 percent water, making it critical that cows always have plenty of access to warm water. But how often are you cleaning and scrubbing your water troughs? It should be done every day or every other day and be clean enough that you would be willing to drink from the troughs. Feed: When cows are done milking, they should come back to fresh feed so that they stand for 20 minutes before lying down. Likewise, dry cows must have ample access to feed. Little issues affect milk quality, yield and the longevity of your cows. Focus on “cowsistency,” and your cows will reward you. Tom highlighted these points among others during his recent Dairy Strong webinar, “Cows don’t lie,” which can be viewed on YouTube.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/cow-comfort-creating-environment-healthy-productive-cows","title":"\n\n                    Cow comfort: Creating an environment for healthy, productive cows\n                    Three elements of a productive cow’s environment","date":"January 11, 2017","contentLength":438}},{"pageContent":"An Interview with Becky Timmons The following is an edited transcript of our interview with Becky Timmons, director of applications research and quality assurance at Alltech. To listen to our entire conversation with Becky, click on the player. Here at ONE 2016, you are presenting on the fish oil dilemma. Why exactly is fish oil important? Fish oil is a very important part of the food chain. If you look at our growing population needing more and more protein to feed the people, aquaculture, which is farmed fish, has finally surpassed the amount of wild capture. With overfishing, we cannot catch enough fish in the sea. We are having to farm, and fish oil is part of that diet to produce farmed fish. Why is fish oil important to humans, how do we get fish oil and what does it contribute to human nutrition? If you think about it, we are all told to eat one to two servings of fish a week and with one serving of that being a fatty fish. The reason for that is the DHA omega-3 portion of that fat, which is very important to our heart health, eye health and brain health. If you think a little further with prenatal vitamins and infant formula, those all have DHA incorporated into them now because it’s so important for brain and eye development of children. Because we have a shortage of fish oil, what are producers doing to make up for that shortage? About 1 million tons of fish oil is all that’s available every year, and that fluctuates a little bit depending on weather conditions and fishing conditions, etc., but the maximum is a million, and, as consumers, we are using every bit of that. Most of it is going for fish farming, but a growing segment is going for direct human nutrition (e.g., the fish oil capsules you take). As more and more of that is going to human nutrition, there is less available to produce farmed fishing. Farmed fish is a growing segment; what are they going to do? They have started to replace fish oil and fish meal with things like vegetable proteins, soymeal, soybean meal and soy oil. What that causes is that omega-3 that’s so important to go down in the fish that you’re eating. Now they are starting to say: Instead of that one to two servings per week, that’s going to double to two to four servings per week. That’s a lot of fish. Sitting down to that salmon dinner no longer has the same value it once did. You have to eat a few more of those a week. That is correct. There have actually been studies done. In Scotland, they pulled about 3,000 salmon and did studies on that to look and see — what are the levels? — and it has gone down significantly. What can be done? Are there any alternatives for producers? Yes, that’s what Alltech is working on. We have an algae that we produce that is a high-fat, high-DHA algae. If you think about it, fish do not naturally produce DHA omega-3. They get it in their food chain; they get it from algae. We are just bypassing the fish and taking that same algae, producing it so that we then have a nice high-fat, high-DHA algae to feed to the fish. Does it matter how the algae are produced? It does. In our case, we are producing this (algae) in very large enclosed vessels. With that, we can control everything — the temperature, the time, the pH, the mixing speed, all of those things that give us very high efficiency, which is good, but also we control the nutrients that we feed it. What that means is, something you hear about with fish and fish oil is that mercury and dioxins can be a problem; we don’t have to worry about that since we are controlling everything going into the system. Algae are not just for aquaculture diets; we see applications for other production species, right? That’s correct. If you think about it — back in history, how we used to feed our animals — we would feed scraps to our pigs and chickens out back. They would naturally have things like that fish oil in the food chain, and therefore it was found naturally in the meat, milk and eggs we would eat. We don’t do that anymore, so now they are fed very heavily on things like soy, corn and distillers grains. What we have found is that if we put in algae, the high-DHA, in any livestock diets, the animal benefits. It is beneficial to their health status as well as it incorporates back naturally into the meat, milk and eggs for human nutrition. I’m sure kids are sometimes more likely to eat some scrambled eggs than a plate of salmon. That is very interesting because, like I said, DHA is something that’s added to prenatal vitamins as well as infant formula, but once a child reaches about 1 year old, where are they getting DHA? They are not munching on salmon or trout. A study showed that in the U.S., the recommended daily intake for a 3-year-old would be 150 milligrams a day. The average American child at 3 years old is getting 19 milligrams per day. That’s a huge discrepancy, and, as you have said, a child is more willing to eat eggs or naturally enriched chicken fingers or hamburger, something like that, that will have the DHA omega-3 in it. There is an incredible opportunity for food companies to specialize and differentiate themselves on the market with these functional foods. What is the availability of algae? Again, when we say algae, algae is a huge category with lots of different types of algae. We’re talking about one specific type that we are producing. We have been working really hard over the last five years, increasing our efficiencies, lowering our costs and increasing our scale so we can produce more and more to be able to fill that gap. Would you consider it to be economical for a producer to incorporate algae in their animals’ diets? Absolutely. How does that work in the animal diet? Can you describe how algae would be added to feed? Our product is a dry powder, so it can be added just like any other feed ingredient. It can be mixed into the meal, and then it can be pelleted, extruded if it were going into a pet food. It can be handled just like any other raw material. The animals enjoy it? Yes, the animals enjoy it. Lastly, you referenced that algae are very diverse organisms. It also brings to mind what we hear about soil and how much of soil is yet to be discovered. Are there some similarities there, and what else is there for us to discover in algae? In soil, you would find hundreds of microorganisms in each gram of soil, even thousands. A lot of those are undiscovered, so now they are starting to find the benefits of soil, the same thing is true with algae. In the ocean and depths of the ocean, there are believed to be several hundred thousand species of algae, and each one is different. You can imagine the untapped resources out there.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/fish-oil-dilemma-are-algae-answer","title":"\n\n                    The fish oil dilemma: Are algae the answer?\n                    ","date":"February 3, 2017","contentLength":1247}},{"pageContent":"Noo-tri-jee-noh-miks: the official pronunciation of nutrigenomics. It’s difficult to say, and it can be even more difficult to understand. In its simplest definition, nutrigenomics is the study of how diet affects gene expression. Even more simply put, nutrigenomics looks at what a person or animal eats and studies how their body responds to it. Nutrigenomics is a relatively new and quickly evolving scientific field. Fortunately, Alltech has been at the forefront of this research for almost a decade. In 2008, Alltech opened the world’s first fully dedicated nutrigenomics and epigenetics lab at the Alltech Center for Animal Nutrigenomics and Applied Animal Nutrition in Nicholasville, Kentucky. Nutrigenomics’ true implications are only now being understood. What value can nutrigenomics bring to animal nutrition research, specifically beef research? 1) Traditional research is slow; nutrigenomics is fast. Compared to poultry or swine research, beef research is horrendously slow. The weeks or months necessary to study other species pales in comparison to the often three to four years needed to capture appropriate lifecycle data for beef cattle. As a result, innovation becomes more challenging and time-consuming for researchers. Many industry products have remained the same for more than 30 years. Nutrigenomics produces data almost immediately, and information can be gathered while cattle are still alive. 2) Traditional research gives us just one (or, sometimes, a few) key data points; nutrigenomics gives us 22,000. With the use of micro-array technology, Alltech uses a specialized gene chip that utilizes tissue samples to show almost instantaneously how a change in diet (or any environmental change) has affected gene expression. The more than 22,000 data points on a gene chip produce a digital reading that shows whether each specific gene is turned on (shown in the reading as “hot”) or turned off (shown in the reading as “cool”). This high volume of data is read using specialized software to inform researchers which pathways have been most affected by a change in diet. This breakthrough dramatically decreases the time needed to conduct and evaluate research. Conversely, traditional research can only look at one issue (or a few issues) at a time and is therefore limited in the depth of its findings. 3) Traditional research explains often only what happened; nutrigenomics tells researcher not only what but also why changes happen within cattle. For instance, Alltech has pinpointed the specific feed ingredients necessary to optimize lean tissue deposition — a key performance parameter in feedlot cattle. Through nutrigenomics, the metabolic pathways crucial to muscle growth have been identified, and as a result, both what has changed (i.e. increased weight gain) and why it has changed (i.e. improvements in energy metabolism) can be observed by researchers. To produce the scale and scientific scope necessary to make these conclusions through traditional research techniques would require investments of time, money and cattle that are simply not feasible in most circumstances. Making nutrigenomics profitable: EPNIX® Now, Alltech is beginning to see the first fruits of its nutrigenomics research in beef. Through more than eight years of nutrigenomic refinement and repeated testing in large-pen commercial feed yards, Alltech is proud to launch its new feedlot technology, EPNIX®. Named to reflect its epigenetic and nutrigenomic roots, EPNIX is a two-part feedlot technology designed to support the carcass weight and dressing percentage of finishing cattle. It is fortified with 100 percent organic trace minerals and is delivered with strategic supplementation through both a receiving and a finishing technology. EPNIX optimizes rumen function and systemic metabolism, bringing new innovation and value to feedlot production. Yet the challenge faced by any new innovation is twofold: Is it relevant, and does it provide a return on investment Designed without antibiotics or antimicrobials, EPNIX is formulated to comply with relevant changes in feeding regulations, such as the Veterinary Feed Directive. To further validate its formulation, EPNIX is certified by IMI Global as a Feed Verified ingredient for use in Verified Natural Beef, Non-Hormone Treated Cattle and Global Animal Partnership programs. Additionally, EPNIX focuses on delivering profitable returns to producers. In repeated, large-pen studies, EPNIX has demonstrated improvements in overall performance and has supported carcass weight gains, which are key to profitability. To explain the research on and key concepts of EPNIX, Alltech recently hosted a webinar led by Dave Pfenninger, Alltech territory sales manager, and Dr. Vaughn Holder, head of beef research for Alltech.

The theme of the conference, “Disrupt the Disruptors,” is about changing the status quo and shaking up the industry by developing and embracing products and ideas that save time and money, improve efficiency and are user friendly. Aidan Connolly, chief innovation officer and vice president of corporate accounts at Alltech, emphasized the importance of agriculture embracing new, disruptive technologies on-farm. “If you don’t embrace disruption, you’ll go out of business,” he explained. Welcoming disruption becomes synonymous with welcoming the future, and the future of agriculture features more efficient farming, faster results and money saved. Connolly detailed the eight technologies that have the power to transform agriculture through disruptive innovation: 3D printing Robots Drones Sensors Artificial intelligence Augmented reality Virtual reality Blockchain “Innovation is key to disrupt an industry,” said Connolly. While it is important for businesses to accept disruption, what does it take for them to achieve disruption in a competitive, ever-expanding market? Dr. Lyons made his message very clear: “Mainstream companies sell products; great companies sell dreams.” To be a disruptor in its industry, a company must sell not only what they are interested in producing, but what the consumer wants; it is a two-way street. “Being a disruptor is about having the dreams of your people aligned with yours, and your dreams aligned with theirs because, ultimately,” said Dr. Lyons, “they’re the ones who count.” In addition to realizing dreams through disruption, he explained that these dreams and ideas are not enough — companies must also have ideals. Laying out the roadmap for successful disruption, Dr. Lyons explained the non-negotiable ideals of Alltech: Remaining a privately owned company Reinvesting time and money into our companies, products and employees Speed: Don’t get it right, get it going Having fun By starting with a dream, innovators and entrepreneurs can begin their journey of disruption. Disruption, after all, begins with just ONE great idea.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/innovation-starts-disruption","title":"\n\n                    Innovation starts with disruption\n                    ","date":"May 22, 2017","contentLength":376}},{"pageContent":"Cows exhibit heat stress in many ways, and the impact can be seen in both the short and long term. Understanding heat stress is critical for producers managing herds in warmer, more humid climates or farms located in areas that experience intense heat spells in summer. There are appropriate management practices to help herds avoid some of the heat and strategies that work with the animal to help a herd manage stress during the summer months. Often the simplest solutions for heat stress are cheap, only requiring good herd management. Here are 10 heat stress management tips to help your herd stay cool. 1. Provide shade. Cows will experience lower respiration rates, decreased body temperature and less aggression when provided with adequate shade. 2. Clean water tanks. Cows can drink 30–50 gallons of water on a normal day, but that number can double when cows experience heat stress. By providing fresh, clean water, cows will drink more and stay hydrated. 3. Feed during cooler hours. Cows don’t like to consume hot feed, and TMRs are prone to heating when left out. By unloading, mixing and feeding in the morning, cows can eat before the feed gets hot and ruminate during the warmer hours of the day. 4. Watch for inconsistent manure. Decreased rumen fermentation efficiency occurs when the cow is experiencing heat stress, leading to lost nutrient utilization. Reformulating the ration can help achieve optimum nutrition potential during phases when dry matter intake drops. 5. Ensure access to feed. Depressed intake is common during heat stress periods. By providing feed at all times, cows will eat small amounts throughout the day to reduce thermal heating from large meals. 6. Use sprinklers, soakers and fans. Observe where the cows are congregating. Why are they there? Is a sprinkler out elsewhere in the barn? Are the fans providing air flow? Even if you have cooling equipment, ensure it is optimally located and functioning properly. 7. Reduce time in holding pens. The key issue with heat stress is that the environment is too warm to dissipate the heat coming from the cows. Keeping cows in close holding pens for prolonged periods of time reduces space and airflow. 8. Don’t lock up during midday. Cows are smart and will move away from areas that are too hot, but only if they have the space to do so. By allowing them to move during the hottest time of the day, you allow them to move to cooler locations in the barn. 9. Feed more digestible high-quality forages. Since cows are prone to eat less when hot, efficiently accessing nutrients is essential to health and production. First cutting or fermented forages provide energy without requiring as much rumination as more fibrous feeds, reducing provisional heating. 10. Utilize a yeast culture additive. Yeast cultures have been found to stimulate the bacteria in the rumen responsible for both fiber digestion and acid removal. This will aid in improved fermentation efficiency and prevent acidosis, which can decrease body temperature. A happy cow makes for a productive cow. Cow comfort is important year-round, but it’s a much bigger challenge in seasons of heat. Proper management of feed, water and shelter can help your herd stay comfortable and productive.

It contributes to the overall economic growth of the country and determines the standard of living for over half of the population of India. The state of Karnataka, an agrarian area in the southwest region where much of the state is still dependent on the monsoon season, has experienced substantial growth in food and grain production through the introduction of improved seed varieties, fertilizer applications and the implementation of irrigation practices. However, these advancements have also resulted in depletion of nutrients and a decrease in organic matter in the soil. In order to overcome these challenges, the local government has implemented measures that include soil fertility status reports and then use the results of these tests to advise growers on more sustainable crop management practices. Karnataka’s growers face several challenges in terms of maintaining their economic viability: Land holdings: Nearly 80 percent of farming families own less than 2 acres of land. Irrigation: 70 percent of the arable land is rainfed. Crop technology: There is limited distribution of seeds and other primary inputs available to average growers, who find cost to be the most prohibitive factor in attaining new technology. Soil erosion and depletion: Large areas of land are susceptible to soil erosion from wind and water. Soils have also historically been overused and overworked, resulting in deteriorated soil health. “The registration of Alltech Crop Science [in Karnataka] is just the beginning,” says Aman Sayed, Alltech’s director of India and South Asia, who is looking forward to giving growers in the region a natural alternative to the traditional fertilizers available. The use of natural-based fertilizers can help increase nutrient availability in the soil and improve plant defenses to stressors, such as those caused by lack of irrigation, and help plants reach their full genetic potential.

Music is what I want to do.”? There’s a common stereotype that the arts and math exist in different realms of talent, or even different parts of the brain. However, historically speaking, arts and math have long been intertwined. The Pythagoreans of ancient Greece were the first researchers known to have investigated the expression of musical scales in terms of numerical ratios. But, what is music, really? One of the simplest, yet most accurate, definitions of music is: sound(s) organized with rhythm, melody and harmony, put together in a meaningful way. All three components — rhythm, melody and harmony — can be described by numbers associated with physical properties. You have probably heard of “harmonic frequency,” or “resonance.” These musical qualities are described using numbers with precise meanings. If you are a casual listener, you’ve probably never realized that the mathematical properties of music have a significant impact on what you favor in terms of style. That is where Tech Gnar — the undergraduate winning venture of the 2017 Alltech Innovation Competition — comes into play. Tech Gnar is an application created by Western Kentucky University (WKU) undergraduate students Taylor Wathen, Zachary Wathen and Blake Knott. The app uses an algorithm to break down songs into numbers and correlate them based on which songs have previously been “liked” by the user. It uses this intelligence to then recommend songs with similar characteristics. “It’s very hard to argue with math,” said Taylor Wathen. The WKU team therefore believes Tech Gnar can beat (pun intended!) competitors’ recommendations with more fine-tuned suggestions for the user. They are now on version number 771 of their app, and it is capable of filtering songs by instrument. According to Taylor Wathen, Tech Gnar’s next steps include launching the website and mobile app as well as working in partnership with some record companies (mainly from Nashville) to come up with “perfect hit songs.” Furthermore, they plan to strengthen their digital presence through enhancements to their algorithm. Before you know it, you could be listening to your new favorite artist, tapping your toes to the very beat that recommended it to you.

In fact, the agricultural area under plastic continues to grow in the province, currently reaching over 64,000 acres according to the latest report from Spain’s Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Food and Environment. The vast number of greenhouse acres in AlmerÍa enables agriculture to remain one of the fundamental pillars of the province’s economy. Its central location provides the additional benefit of being able to supply fresh produce to markets throughout Europe year-round. The importance of healthy soil to maintain the viability of a greenhouse is evident in the care that growers in AlmerÍa have taken to increase organic matter and nutrient availability through the incorporation of manure and naturally based products.

Access to clean water is fundamental for all living creatures, and for farm animals, the quality of the water they drink can have a direct impact on performance and productivity. Like humans, most of the pig’s body is water, making up 82 percent of a young pig’s bodyweight and 55 percent of grown pig’s bodyweight (Kober, 1993). In general, pigs tend to drink about 10 percent of their bodyweight per day or roughly two times the amount of feed they eat. Mortality, feed intake, growth rates and feed efficiency rates are known to be affected by the quality of the water provided (Stull et al., 1999). Five points of water quality in pig production In general, the quality of the pig’s water can be determined by measuring the presence of the following organic and inorganic elements: 1.Total bacterial count Water contamination by bacteria is estimated by measuring the level of coliforms per milliliter of water. A total bacterial count of 50 colony forming units (cfu)/ml is considered good. If coliform levels are higher than 100 cfu/ml, then it is recommended to use a chlorine treatment. When dealing with bacteria in the drinking water, it is important to consider the cleanliness of the water lines. Biofilm in pipes can be a considerable source of microorganisms in the water, but chlorine-based disinfectants have little to no effect on biofilms. It’s important to flush out all buildup regularly. 2. pH Water pH ranging from 5.5 to 8.5 is considered acceptable. If water is too acidic (lower than 5), it can create corrosion and damage pipes and waterlines; on the other hand, a basic pH (higher than 8.5) can leave scaly deposits. 3. Hardness Calcium and magnesium are the two predominant minerals that make water “hard.” In pig production, hard water can contribute to the formation of scale deposits. The optimum water hardness in pig production is below 60 parts per million (ppm) of calcium carbonate (CaCO3). 4. Total dissolved solids Total dissolved solids (TDS), also known as water salinity, is the amount of soluble salts and minerals dissolved in the water. Contaminants are usually measured in parts per million (ppm). The majority of the time, the amount of minerals or salts dissolved is well within the acceptable ranges, but sometimes very high levels can damage performance or equipment. 5. Nitrates and nitrites Nitrates and nitrites are usually present in the water because the water supply is exposed to material with high nitrogen levels, such as animal waste, nitrogen fertilizers or decomposing organic material. Especially in monogastric animals, nitrites are 10 times more toxic than nitrates (Emerick, 1974). Levels as low as 0.10 mg/l of nitrite can impact performance in pigs. There are various methods for treating water based on the type of issue as well as its severity: Problem Solution Coliform count Chlorinate water Water hardness Install a water softener High nitrates or other minerals Iron exchange or reverse osmosis treatment system Iron Filtration High water pH Acidification Good water quality starts by implementing a program for testing as well as training farm personnel on spotting issues. It is recommended to test water quality in the pig barn at least twice a year and to test both at the beginning and at the end of the water lines. Over time, a biofilm will form inside pipes; it is important to treat waterlines with hydrogen peroxide and organic acids to flush out any buildup. Water is the single most important nutrient, yet sometimes it can be taken for granted. By implementing a program that monitors and maintains proper levels of the five water quality indicators and by carrying out proper equipment maintenance, pig producers will be able to avoid costly problems that can negatively affect the performance of their herd. Quality norms for water Good Take action pH 5.5–8.5 < 4 or > 9 Ammonium (mg/l) < 1.0 > 2.0 Nitrite (mg/l) < 0.10 > 1.00 Nitrate (mg/l) < 100 > 200 Chloride (mg/l) < 250 > 2,000 Sodium (mg/l) < 400 > 800 Sulfate (mg/l) < 150 > 250 Iron (mg/l) < 0.5 > 10.0 Manganese (mg/l) < 1.0 > 2.0 Hardness (ppm) < 60 > 300 Coliforms (cfu/ml) < 100 > 100 Total bacterial count (cfu/ml) < 100,000 > 100,000 I want to learn more about nutrition for my pig herd.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/water-quality-pig-production-pay-attention-these-5-indicators","title":"\n\n                    Water quality in pig production: Pay attention to these 5 indicators\n                    ","date":"March 22, 2017","contentLength":741}},{"pageContent":"Beat heat stress With the European summer only weeks away, it is time to start preparing management strategies for heat stress. This issue has traditionally been associated with the hotter regions in Europe, such as the Mediterranean. However, as climate change continues to impact temperature, European countries deemed to have a more temperate climate must also be aware of and prepare to take action against heat stress. When cows are suffering from heat stress, there are several indicators that can be observed. Often, the first indicator is a reduction in dry matter intake. This can be followed by a change in behaviour, combined with quickened breathing and excessive panting. This leads to difficulties in maintaining efficient rumen function, which results in decreased milk production and longer periods between conception. The cow’s maintenance needs will also increase, as the animal can be at greater risk of contracting diseases, such as subacute ruminal acidosis and laminitis. All of these negative heat stress effects will lower a farm’s ability to maintain efficiency and profitability. Don’t let your profits dry up this summer! Follow these top tips to combat the effects of heat stress on your farm. 1. Water management As temperatures increases, so does the cow’s water intake. However, a large volume of water is lost through increased urinary excretion, sweating and respiration. Therefore, water requirements for lactating cows can increase by 10 percent as temperatures move from 15 degrees Celsius to 26 degrees Celsius. The need for more water will increase as milk production rises and as temperatures rise above 26 degrees Celsius. A cow’s water intake can be improved by: Locating water troughs in shaded areas. Ensuring there is an adequate supply of fresh water at the trough. Cleaning water troughs regularly. Providing sufficient space for the cow at the water trough; there should be a minimum of two linear feet (0.61 metres) per 15–20 cows. Cooling the water trough by adding shade. 2. Forage management It is very important to identify forages that are highly digestible to use during heat stress. This will help maintain intake and energy levels. Ensure a forage’s quality is not compromised by managing the silage face to minimise secondary fermentation. When packing the silage, make certain that it is tightly compressed and covered sufficiently to avoid spoilage. Remove 6–12 inches of silage from the exposed face of the silo on a daily basis. This will help to keep the silage fresh and will prevent heating. 3. Feeding management As the temperature and humidity increase, cows will change the time they feed to a cooler period of the day. A greater proportion of the feed should be provided later in the day, when the temperature has dropped. This will help to avoid secondary fermentation and drive consumption. Three to four hours after cows feed, they will experience excess heat production due to the digestion process. By moving the feeding time to later in the day, the cow will have the opportunity to digest the food when the temperature is cooler. This allows the increased internal heat production to be more tolerable for the cow. At the end of each day, it is important to clean out feed bunks. This will help to keep the feed fresh and will reduce the possible effects of heating or spoilage as well as lower the risk of secondary fermentation.

At ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference (ONE17), 10 ready-for-market companies took the stage by telling a crowd of 4,000 potential investors and business partners what their plans are to disrupt the industry. How can these companies change the way we farm and the way we eat? Agrilyst: Determined to help indoor farmers save money and increase yields through data collection, Agrilyst aims to be an at-home digital agronomist pushing farmers to achieve year-round revenue. AgriWebb: Optimizing farm efficiency and looking to solve a $25 billion issue in agriculture, AgriWebb supports farmers by tracking their data and accreditation needs. “I wanted to solve real problems for real people,” Kevin Baum, co-founder and CEO of AgriWebb, told the crowd. Alesca Life: As a company that allows commercial-scale farming anywhere, Alesca Life saves water, promotes urban farming and meets the demand of fresh produce and organic food. Because farms are available in a shipping container, Alesca Life CEO Stuart Oda said that his company provides “local food production by anyone, anywhere.” eFishery: Overfeeding at shrimp and fish farms is a big issue in aquaculture, especially when 80% of the total cost at farms is feed. eFishery senses a fish’s appetite, adjusts the amount of feed needed and automatically distributes it to reduce a farmer’s cost by up to 21%. Greengage: When light can affect a chicken’s physiology, behavior and productivity, farmers should look to Greengage for a solution. Their LED lights that can last 60,000 hours can reduce mortality rates, increase yields and lead to more productive chickens. Hargol FoodTech: As the world’s first commercial grasshopper farm, Hargol FoodTech is disrupting the industry by proposing a new, sustainable grasshopper protein. With 72% protein, essential amino acids and a neutral taste, it has the potential to become a power protein player in providing solutions to our world’s future food crisis. MagGrow: An astounding 70% of what is sprayed does not reach the target crop, and as the CEO of MagGrow, Gary Wickham, said, “It’s waste,” particularly when 80% of the world’s available water is being used for agriculture. By using a magnetic spraying system, MagGrow disrupts the status quo by reducing water drift by over 80%. It is “truly using less to grow more, and that’s what the world needs,” explained Wickham. Moocall: Using calving sensors to measure contractions, Moocall can predict when a cow is going into labor. This innovative device will text and email a farmer an hour before the cow gives birth, marginalizing the $2 billion loss farmers experience per year due to cow and calf death during birth. SkySquirrel: Utilizing the disruptive technology of drones, SkySquirrel has created a technology used for monitoring crop health. This invention can save the wine industry $15 billion per year by detecting diseases in the vineyard. Tevatronic: “What do you think will happen with a system that will decide for you?” Oleg Koral, Tevatronics CEO, asked the crowd. The company, which is revolutionizing the future of irrigation, has developed an autonomous system that knows when to start and stop irrigation on crops so they receive just the right amount of water at the right time. The culmination of a 15-week program called The Pearse Lyons Accelerator, the 10 companies (which were chosen out of almost 200 applicants) have been provided with mentorship and new industry connections. They also received over €300,000 in software perks from Google, Amazon and Softlayer. “Since starting The Pearse Lyons Accelerator 100 days ago, we have doubled our revenue,” Agrilyst CEO Allison Kopf enthusiastically told the crowd. Connolly, one of the mentors of The Pearse Lyons Accelerator program, gave future and current entrepreneurs a piece of advice before ending the session. “You have to be passionate about what you do, but the focus is absolutely critical,” he said. “The business is not going to come to you; you have to go and find the business.” One thing is clear: with disruptive ideas from around the world and a growing interest by investors in agriculture, a sustainable future seems more possible than ever before.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/10-agri-tech-disruptions-could-shape-future-farming-and-food","title":"\n\n                    10 agri-tech disruptions that could shape the future of farming and food\n                    ","date":"May 23, 2017","contentLength":753}},{"pageContent":"For the Chinese, the rooster symbolizes vitality, honesty, integrity and luck, but what meaning does the Chinese poultry industry have to the world? “China is different and is not for the faint-hearted,” said Dr. Mark Lyons, executive vice president and head of Greater China for Alltech, during the Alltech Annual Breakfast Meeting at the 2017 International Production & Processing Expo. There has been a great urban shift of 300 million people within the economic power player, resulting in 188 cities in China that are larger than Chicago. Additionally, China has a rising middle class that is young, urban and globally minded. Since the annual Alltech Global Feed Survey began in 2011, China has dominated the world’s feed production, responsible for approximately 35 percent of the world’s total animal feed. In terms of poultry specifically, China is home to 20 percent of the world’s 60 billion poultry birds, including 8.8 billion broilers, 1.2 billion layers/breeders and 4 billion waterfowl. Currently, China produces 26 percent of the world’s poultry meat, and studies show that both consumption and production of poultry will continue to increase in China, and worldwide, over the next 10 years. China is also the world leader in egg production, producing almost six times more than the United States, which is in second place. Poultry trends in China Both the poultry and egg industry are moving toward integration. Consumer awareness of environmental pollution is growing and creating pressure at the farm level. Antibiotic-free production is a growing trend as testing and legislation increase. Pressure from the cost of feed materials is rising. Desire for high-quality poultry products is increasing.

Prosumers are product and brand advocates who now significantly affect the success or failure of companies, products and brands through their involvement on social media outlets.

Getting cows off to the best possible start in early lactation is critical on every dairy farm. During spring, it is essential to ensure that the nutrient intake of the cow is adequate to meet her needs. Poor management during this important stage can lead to reduced intakes and losses in body condition score (BCS), leading to fertility issues, which can have a significant impact on a dairy farm’s bottom line. Three ways to optimize dairy cow fertility 1. Close the energy gap In early lactation, cows will inevitably be in a negative energy balance, meaning they are not able to take in as much energy as they require because their peak milk yield occurs before their peak in dry matter intake. Therefore, they will lose a certain amount of condition. Managing cows appropriately can minimize BCS loss during this period. One way this can be done is by feeding a diet that will encourage intake and provide adequate energy. Often in early lactation, European cows are in a situation where they are being fed grazed grass, grass silage and concentrates. This may be cost effective, but it is not ideal for rumen conditions. 2. Maximize immunity and health Early lactation is typically a period of stress for the cow, as there are a number of physiological and nutritional changes during this time. It is critical to ensure she has an optimal immune status during early lactation in order to maximize fertility. Some cows will have a higher risk of uterine infections due to retained placenta and metritis after calving. Uterine infections and ovarian problems will inevitably have an effect on fertility. Trace minerals, such as selenium, play a key role in maintaining a healthy immune system in the calving period. Other trace minerals, such as copper, and major minerals, such as phosphorus, play key roles in ovulation and cycling; if there is a deficiency in either, the possibility of anoestrus becomes more likely. Research has proven that feeding these trace minerals in their organic form — for example, Bioplex® Copper, Bioplex® Zinc and Sel-Plex®, an organic form of selenium from Alltech — leads to these minerals being better absorbed, stored and utilized by the animal. 3. Look after the rumen The rumen is essentially the engine that drives the cow. The key to getting more from feed is to ensure that the rumen is working as efficiently as possible. Increased nutrient absorption allows for more milk production and also reduces the need for the cow to take these valuable nutrients from its own body reserves. This depletion of body reserves lies at the core of cow health and infertility issues. The rumen is not designed for abrupt changes, so it is recommended that cows are gradually introduced to grass in early lactation and, if possible, are brought in at night for the first seven to 10 days after calving. If turned out abruptly, it is likely that the cow’s grass intake will not be enough to meet her energy requirements. This will have a negative impact on her BCS. The increase in starch and sugar levels in the diet during this period will cause a decrease in the pH levels in the rumen.

Their primary objective was to address a less commonly realized but ever-prevalent issue affecting U.S. citizens: food insecurity. Some may be asking themselves what exactly the term “food insecurity” means. It is defined as being without consistent access to an adequate supply of reasonably priced, healthy food. And, while it may seem almost inconceivable for such a highly developed country to be dealing with an issue like hunger, according to the United States Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service, it’s an unfortunate reality for some 41.2 million Americans living in food-insecure households. Fortunately, the U.S. has one of the most comprehensive feeding programs in the world, offering the Woman, Infants and Children (WIC) program, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and National School Lunch Program (NSLP). Yet, programs like SNAP have no restrictions. People may buy whatever unhealthy options they wish to, and often do. So, the question arises: Should we limit participant options? And, while we’ve come a long way from the days of food stamps and the associated stigmas, many feel that restricting offerings would only serve to further reinforce shame felt by program participants. Domino effect According to estimates from the 2015 U.S. Census Bureau, the official poverty rate is roughly 13.5 percent, meaning over 43 million Americans are living on an insufficient income. The nation also sits at a record high obesity rate; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 36.5 percent of U.S. adults are considered grossly overweight. It would seem these two issues go hand in hand with the issue of food insecurity. People are not only undereducated on nutrition but are often unsure how to prepare food. To put it simply, many people don’t know how to cook anymore. Without this knowledge, most seek quick, convenient and often calorie-dense options. And we are paying a high price for these correlations: Globally, more people are dying of non-communicable diseases (e.g., heart disease and diabetes) than communicable diseases. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity are some of the top reasons for premature death. Obesity is one of the biggest drivers of healthcare costs. In fact, the fastest growing part of the U.S. budget is healthcare. The United States spends an estimated $147 to $210 billion annually on costs associated with preventable chronic diseases. Focus on nutrition, not just hunger The panel did seem to collectively agree that nutrition education should continue to be a top priority. The Expanded Food and Nutrition Education Program (EFNEP) was established nearly 50 years ago to help with nutrition and exercise-related behaviors for low-income families, particularly those with small children. SNAP to Health is another example of an effective program aimed at reducing food insecurity and promoting better nutrition for Americans. Additionally, many grocery store chains are now employing dietitians to help consumers make better choices, often at little to no cost. How agriculture can help We must continue to be proactive in our efforts to end hunger in this country. Not surprisingly, agriculture will continue to play a critical role. We are making headway with efforts such as the expansion of farmers markets and local food options, more widely available crop insurance and risk management tools, and the establishment of farm-to-school program grants for sourcing local foods. But the hard work can’t stop there. As our population continues to grow and weather patterns shift, we will need to continue to examine new resources, fresh ideas and innovative technologies, all aimed at making food insecurity a thing of the past. How do you think the future of farming will impact issues like food insecurity? A panel of agribusiness experts recently discussed “Farming the Future” and what it may hold for not only agriculture, but the entire food supply chain.

But the big picture also affects other groups like veterinarians and how they manage antibiotics for their clients. With many affected by these changes, it is important that the industry as a whole maps out the issues and works together more closely to reduce any risk of errors or additional challenges in this process. To help address some of these issues, we asked our team in the field: What are the most frequently asked questions across the U.S. following the new VFD? 1. How does my VFD look? This one is a big worry for a lot of people, and for good reason. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will eventually start auditing to ensure the VFD is working and that people are in compliance. This means it is important for dealers and their customers to have a proper recordkeeping system and accurate information in their VFDs. The FDA has provided examples of properly filled out VFDs that you can reference on pages 12–16 of the Common Format Q&A. It is also very important to make sure your figures are accurate. With no feed amount specified in the VFD, number of head and days are the two most important figures. It is important that the vet knows the approximate number of animals for the VFD, which should include any animal that has the potential to be fed a VFD feed, and it is also good for your vet to have an understanding of the capacity and normal animal turnover in your facility. This enables them to make sure the amount of feed sold under the VFD is consistent with the number of head covered. During inspections, VFD orders may be compared to manufacturing records, so these need to match up. You also want to make sure to include everything that is required when filling out the form. For example, there is a cautionary statement that should be included on all invoices for customers. The FDA wants feed distributors to ensure all labeling and advertising prominently and conspicuously displays the following cautionary statement: “Caution: Federal law restricts medicated feed containing this veterinary feed directive (VFD) drug to use by or on the order of a licensed veterinarian.” 2. Can we store VFDs digitally? Dealers and farmers can store their VFDs in any format, including digital or paper. However, errors seem to be more common with handwritten VFDs. To help reduce the risk of an error, it may be beneficial for veterinarians to use an electronic VFD. This can make storing your VFDs digitally even easier. Additionally, since you have to retain a copy of the VFD for two years, this will help reduce the amount of paper you have to have on file. 3. Can I use a VFD for multiple groups? You can use a VFD for multiple groups, provided the veterinarian has a VCPR and is comfortable with the health and management of each of the sites covered by the VFD. This is why making sure you have a good relationship with your vet is so important. They need to have a strong understanding of your animals and their conditions to make the best decisions for you and your operation. Many other challenges are going to come up as the VFD continues, so it is vital that you are able to discuss these matters with your vet. For example, you may need a second VFD for different feeding periods, or a VFD may expire and the vet will need to write a new one. This is a process that requires constant communication with your veterinarian to ensure accuracy and that your animals are kept as safe and healthy as possible. As our industry comes together to deal with the VFD, we are learning more about what works and what we need to change. “Though it comes with its challenges, the VFD has created a great opportunity for the industry to review what they are doing in terms of feeding their animals,” says Lori Stevermer, marketing specialist for Hubbard Feeds. “Often, antibiotics were fed because that’s what was done in the past. Now, we need to work more closely with our veterinarians to determine what is best for our animals, and our future.” By requiring us to take a closer look at our feeding processes and our relationships, the VFD presents an opportunity to strengthen our industry. This will help us determine what is best not only for our animals, but what is best for our families and the consumer. For more information on or questions about the VFD, the frequently asked questions at the American Association of Swine Veterinarians (AASV) is a great resource. Also, feel free to reach out to your local Alltech or Hubbard Feeds representative for assistance with your nutrition.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/top-3-questions-following-new-veterinary-feed-directive-vfd","title":"\n\n                    Top 3 questions following the new Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD)\n                    ","date":"February 28, 2018","contentLength":834}},{"pageContent":"When Dr. Majid Fotuhi was a young boy, his father said, “Majid, our brain is amazing, and there is no limit to what you can do.” By the time Fotuhi graduated high school in 1980, his country was at war with Iraq. Rather than face certain death in battle, Fotuhi decided to risk his life by leaving the country. He studied 12 to 16 hours a day, learning English, French and German, unsure of where his journey would lead. After being smuggled out of the country, Fotuhi went on to receive his M.D. from Harvard Medical School as a member of the Harvard-MIT Program of Health Sciences and Technology and his Ph.D. in neuroscience from Johns Hopkins University. His curiosity about why some people have a healthy brain while others show signs of aging led to his studies on neurology, with a specific focus on the hippocampus. Today, Fotuhi is a widely regarded authority in the field of memory, Alzheimer’s disease and increasing brain vitality in late life. The devastating effects of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia, which affects more than 50 million people worldwide, are often regarded as an inevitable part of the aging process, but Fotuhi says that isn’t so. “Many of us think that when we get older, our brain function must inevitably go downhill, but that's not true,” said Fotuhi, speaking to the audience at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference. “Now we can start doing things to expand our brain.” Is Fotuhi suggesting it’s possible to actually grow your brain? “It is possible,” he said. “Brain health can be improved at any age.” Fotuhi recommends embracing a healthy lifestyle that includes omega-3, meditation, learning something new every day and sleeping well. He initiated a 12-week study wherein participants incorporated these strategies into their daily routines. Using a before-and-after MRI of a participant’s brain, Fotuhi illustrated the significant expansion of the hippocampus, mirroring the brain of someone 10 years younger. “Having a purpose in life can have an impact on your brain,” said Fotuhi. “If you are someone who feels passionate about your goals, if you have a purpose-driven life, your brain is healthier.” Fotuhi encouraged the audience to take responsibility for their brain health. “Think of your brain the same way you think of the health of your teeth,” he urged. So, with the daily demands of work and life, how does one make brain health a priority? Fotuhi emphasizes reducing stress, not activity. “You need to do what you love doing,” he said. “It’s not a matter of ‘stop working’ — you need to keep your brain active. There is a difference between being busy and being stressed out.” Referring to his father’s early sentiments about the brain’s capacity, Fotuhi said, “Now I believe him. Even more so than I did back then. “Use it or lose it applies to your brain more than it applies to your muscles,” he continued. “The moment you stop using your brain is the moment you go downhill.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/dr-majid-fotuhi-memory-cure-mission-impossible","title":"\n\n                    Dr. Majid Fotuhi: Is a memory cure mission impossible?\n                    ","date":"May 21, 2018","contentLength":514}},{"pageContent":"The following is an excerpt from an article by Solutions Deployment Team Manager Dr. Jules Taylor-Pickard on Pig Progress. Times are long gone when supplying minerals to pigs was one-size-fits-all. Sows have different demands depending on their parity, size and litter size. Supplying the correct amounts will enhance sow performance — and will provide benefits for her piglets, too. Minerals are important for maintaining the body and ensuring animal performance. In breeding sows, certain minerals are needed for successful conception and parturition. Chromium influences follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones and is also needed to produce insulin, which affects progesterone production. Both hormones are required for regulating ovulation and have a direct impact on fertility and litter numbers. Manganese is required for progesterone production, while iron and chromium are required for further hormone activity, which influences embryo survival during pregnancy. Uterine capacity, which dictates the number of piglets born, requires appropriate feeding levels of selenium, iron and chromium. Breeding animals have higher mineral requirements, since they must produce ova that are robust enough to achieve conception, supply developing fetuses with minerals for correct development and, in the case of mammals, produce milk to suckle their young. As such, breeding sows can often be deficient in mineral intake, especially when tissue reserves are depleted. Dr. Pickard further delves into the different roles minerals play in supporting optimum sow performance and the difference the right mineral can make to your sows and her piglets.

Below is an edited transcript of his recorded comments on optimizing feedstuffs. Watch the full video here: I want to talk to you a little bit today about feedstuffs: in particular, different ingredients and total mixed rations. We know that a herd’s diet is made up of multiple ingredients. For example, when we have a grain mix, a nutritionist is going to add up to 30 different ingredients that will mix together into a balanced diet for the animal. A cow at a high production level is going to have the ability to consume approximately 50–60 pounds of the feedstuff a day. She has an outstanding ability for taste and smell, much better than we as humans have, so we are balancing this diet with all of these different ingredients to create a diet that is not only nutritionally balanced, but also palatable. Maximize performance When nutritionists look at a diet, we try to figure out the cow’s production level. This includes her milking performance, her reproduction performance and maximizing her overall health. Making a high-quality, balanced diet for a healthy animal will help her to perform, do well on a farm and be profitable for the producer. TMRs One of the problems we have when feeding a ration is that we include feed ingredients that animals prefer, and they will sort through to find individual ingredients. So, what we do to avoid that is running the feedstuff through a mixer to make what we call a TMR (total mixed ration), in which we combine all these ingredients together into one diet. We do that to create uniformity and to keep these cows consuming their diet consistently. Cows are great at finding the feedstuff that is more palatable to them and will look for that “goodie” or that “candy” in their diet. It is crucially important to have the feedstuff in the TMR mixed effectively to maintain performance levels at high volumes and uphold good health.

When looking at a lactating herd, it is critical to find ways to minimize the effects of heat. But one vital area of the farm that is affected by heat is sometimes overlooked: calves can be extremely susceptible to higher temperatures due to their smaller body mass and higher respiration rate. Calves and lactating cows experience heat stress at different levels. For a mature lactating animal, the level at which they begin to experience heat stress is at around 60 degrees Fahrenheit and is lower in humid environments. In contrast, calves start feeling heat stress around 75-80 degrees Fahrenheit. In the summer sun, calves look for relief in their hutches, but sometimes the hutch environment can be even hotter and more humid than the outside environment. By managing the following three key areas, producers can ensure that their calves stay cool and healthy during the hottest time of the year. Drink up: Keep calves hydrated Though it might seem obvious, ensuring calves have an adequate water supply that is fresh and clean can be a key factor in helping to prevent dehydration. Dehydration can be particularly dangerous during times of gastrointestinal stress, which can hinder a calf’s rate of recovery. Water acidifiers have been shown to increase water consumption because they make the water more palatable to the calves, which encourages them to drink more. Shoo, fly — don’t bother the calves! Hot temperatures go hand in hand with flies. It is extremely important to control flies in the calf’s environment, as flies are a main offender when it comes to transferring dangerous bacteria throughout the herd. Illnesses such as pink eye are known to be spread by flies. Recent research has also shown that flies can be carriers of some strains of Salmonella, which can show up later in life as a cause of mastitis at first lactation. Common fly control methods include an Insect Growth Regulator (IGR) in the feed as well as treating and spraying around hutches with chemicals labeled to assist in fly control. Easy, breezy temperature maintenance Adequate ventilation is important for calves, especially if they are kept inside an enclosed area or barn. Some operations may have a more serious ventilation issue when using automatic feeders because the bedding can be more prone to moisture. Ensuring the bedding remains clean and dry is critical to calf health and longevity. As temperatures rise, ammonia levels tend to rise as well, and wet bedding can pose a serious threat to calves as a result. Utilizing an ammonia binding product can be helpful. De-Odorase®, a product from Alltech, is commonly utilized in calf barns to control ammonia issues. Adequate ventilation is also important in the hutch. One key component to hutch ventilation is keeping vents open during the day, as hutches can get too hot if vents are closed. What many people don’t think about in the summer, though, is that hutches can also get too cold on cool evenings if the vents are not closed at night. This is particularly concerning in the summer because usually less bedding is used during this time, and a cold front can be hard on the less protected calves, especially when they are younger. Heat stress can affect herds in many ways. Herd longevity and the future of operations depend on the health of calves, who rely on farm owners and managers taking the necessary steps to ensure they remain healthy during the summer.

Luckily, much like ours, your pet’s body has a built-in line of defense to fight pathogens that cause illness. Optimal selenium nutrition can help strengthen these defenses and enable your pet to fight its best battle against disease. What happens when your pet is infected by a virus? When your pet is exposed to a virus, their body launches a series of defense mechanisms that make up the immune system response. The immune system is responsible for identifying foreign intruders called pathogens that can cause disease and mounting a defense against them before they can make your pet sick. The immune system has two main components: the innate and the adaptive immune systems. The innate immune system is the first line of defense and includes barriers like skin and non-specific immune cells like macrophages, whose sole purpose is to attack at the site of infection. This general, non-specific immune response is a rapid onset, taking only a few hours. But what happens if this isn’t enough and the virus or pathogen continues to infect? This is where the adaptive immune response kicks in. The components of this part of the immune system remain quiet until they are activated and adapt to the presence of the virus. The adaptive immune system is comprised of humoral, mediated by antibodies produced by B cells, and cell-mediated response, mediated by T cells. B cells make special proteins called antibodies that locate the virus and help the body destroy them. T cells, on the other hand, take a less direct route and form helper T cells and killer T cells. Killer T cells find and destroy viral-infected cells, while helper T cells coordinate the effort. The cells are destroyed and viral shedding to other cells is reduced. To better help your pet during subsequent exposure, components of the adaptive immune system can produce memory cells. These cells “remember” the pathogen so when the same pathogen infects your pet again, the response is faster and stronger. The challenge with some viruses is that they mutate, causing small changes that make it so your pet’s body doesn’t recognize it as the same pathogen. What role can organic selenium play in your pet’s health? Selenium is an essential trace mineral that is required in the diet of animals. Once consumed, selenium is incorporated into a family of proteins called selenoproteins. Selenoproteins are expressed in almost all tissues of the body and have vital biological roles. Selenoproteins function in hormone metabolism, redox regulation and antioxidant defenses. Selenium can be found in the diet in two primary forms: inorganic (a salt form) and organic (selenium yeasts). You may wonder how your pet’s immune system, viruses and selenium relate. Selenium has two roles: maintaining proper function and strength of the immune system, and counteracting the oxidative damage associated with infection. In chickens, selenium can reduce viral shedding and increase the expression of important anti-viral genes like interferons. In horses, selenium increases the expression of cytokines in immune cells. This link between selenium status and innate immune system function becomes clearer when you look at studies using selenium-deficient animals. These animals not only have higher pathogen loads, but they have reduced numbers of immune cells. The cells that are present do not function as properly as those of a normal animal. Luckily, these problems can be reversed simply by adding selenium back to the animal’s diet. At the adaptive immunity level, selenium can improve antibody production by B cells and accelerate T cell proliferation and total numbers. Conclusion A healthy immune system is your pet’s first line of defense against sickness and disease. If you remember when you were little, your mom might have said you have to “feed a cold.” While it might have sounded silly at the time, she wasn’t far off. Proper nutrition, especially selenium, is essential to make sure your body can fight off viral infections. The same is true for your dog or cat. No one likes when their pet gets sick, so ensuring they are eating a healthy diet containing optimal levels of selenium can help prevent this.

No. There are many factors that affect palatability in dogs and cat foods. Pet foods have many goals. At a basic level, they need to meet nutritional requirements. Beyond that, they should include ingredients that differentiate the product on crowded store shelves and echo a brand philosophy to which consumers, particularly millennials, feel connected. But, none of this matters if dogs and cats don’t like it. Choosing ingredients is the easy part. Ensuring the food tastes amazing to Fido and Kitty is a whole other science that involves parameters such as: Texture Shape Hardness Surface area Moisture Particle size Dogs and cats have different opinions on what makes their food taste good. The cat’s cravings Cats prefer a slightly acidic taste and a lower moisture content. As carnivores, it’s in their nature to have an affinity for animal protein, which is an excellent source of amino acids, contributing to an overall acidic taste. Organic acids, such as citric acid, can also be used as a finishing touch to provide cats with that “meow” factor! The pooch’s preferences Dogs prefer a product with a higher moisture value, around 8–10 percent. Historically, they are obligate omnivores with a diet comprised of animal proteins as well as high moisture content fruits and vegetables. Dogs also enjoy a slightly sweet flavor. Using ingredients with a slightly sweet taste, such as a nutrient-dense yeast extract, can have a big impact on boosting palatability. Cats and dogs agree on food shapes We used to believe that cats and dogs differed greatly in their preference of food shape, too, but recent studies have shown that dogs and cats are surprisingly similar. Dogs prefer round discs, while cats prefer ovals. This could be due to the fact that a round disc or oval shape has more surface area to distribute the delicious fats and coatings applied to the exterior of the kibble. Kibble: Chunky and crunchy The hardness of the kibble is important as well. Both cats and dogs appreciate a crunch, yet the kibble has to break into chunks in their mouth rather than flake apart. No cat or dog wants to eat a kibble that has a grainy texture or an uneven texture. Small particle size is a key factor to developing a smooth kibble. Fresh is best in pet foods Lastly, make sure food is, and stays, fresh. Dogs and cats can detect rancidity or spoiled ingredients from a mile away. Using a natural antioxidant, such as mixed tocopherols, goes a long way in ensuring fats don’t deteriorate during the shelf life of the product. Ironically, dogs will happily seek out whatever the neighbor’s dog has left on the lawn or sniff around the kitchen garbage. But, when it comes to what’s in the food bowl, our best friends demand the best to satisfy their exceptionally sophisticated palate.

Stored feed is at risk for mold growth, which can lead to the development of mycotoxins, as well as insect and pest damage, ultimately reducing the nutrient density of the feed. Properly managing feed stored in bulk bins is important to prevent this reduction in nutrition. There are several approaches to maintaining quality feed during bulk-bin storage, including: Running bins empty before refilling them with new deliveries. Not allowing old feed to accumulate in corners or pipework. Keeping bins in good condition to prevent water ingress. Restricting access by rodents and insects. Bins should be regularly inspected for rust or damage, including leaking seams or loose joints. The inlet and outlet augers need to be examined for damage and the buildup of old feed. Ideally, all bins should be run empty in 30 days, so producers should ensure that they have enough storage capacity to allow for this without running out of feed. In spring and autumn (or every six months), all bins should be run empty and treated with a mold inhibitor. Bin interiors must be cleaned out with a pressure washer, with close attention given to any corners or other areas where old feed may have become trapped. Bins must be completely dry before they are refilled. Fumigation can be used to control any insects or mites that may be present, and a rodent control program should be instated and regularly reviewed. The risks of mycotoxins in swine feed Old, stale and/or damp feed will rapidly develop mold growths. This, in turn, produces mycotoxins, which contaminate the feed and can be highly problematic for pigs. Compared to cattle, pigs are very sensitive to mycotoxins. Young pigs and breeding sows/boars are generally the most susceptible to mycotoxins. The presence of mycotoxins in the feed, even at low levels, can lead to infertility and abortions, palatability problems, feed wastage and a loss of nutrients (due to fungal activity breaking down the nutrients in the feed). These problems lead to reduced average daily gains and poor performance, reduced reproduction and conception rates, increased disease and health issues on the farm and, ultimately, loss of profits. Feed ingredients such as corn, soybeans and other cereals, which are used as major components of pig feed, are exposed to fungal contamination in the field. The risk of contamination may be higher in years with wetter harvest conditions. To protect against any potential fungal contamination and to reduce the risks of mycotoxins, a proven, broad-spectrum mycotoxin binder that will negate the effects of the toxins in your herd should be incorporated into the feed. Furthermore, implementing an all-encompassing prevention program, such as the Alltech® Mycotoxin Management program, is an important part of any feed hygiene and quality strategy on-farm. Mite contamination Insect infestations in bulk feed can lead to several issues. Cereal mites bore into grain and are attracted to the starch content of milled or pelleted diets. As mites consume this energy-dense feed component, they unbalance the diet by diluting its energy levels, also potentially affecting the feed’s palatability. Mite contamination also reduces the energy-to-protein balance (which can affect weight gain) and increases both the relative fiber levels and the amount of food wastage. These effects have a major impact on feed conversion efficiency and growth performance, ultimately affecting profitability. Wet feeding Offering pigs feeds that are wet or moist poses a major risk for potential fungal and bacterial contamination. If a farm does use wet feeds, it is essential that they pay close attention to equipment hygiene and the quality of each delivered batch. Wet feeds that are not fresh and/or have been stored multiple times before delivery, especially during hotter months, are high-risk for contamination. All storage and processing/mixing areas must be regularly cleaned and disinfected as instructed through a strict hygiene plan. Any splashed water spilled during delivery or the use of wet feeds must be cleaned up immediately. Storage tanks and pipework must be washed out to mitigate fungal growth and to prevent attracting the attention of rodents, wild birds or insects. Liquid feeding systems must be fitted with drainage points to allow for regular cleaning and efficient draining. Pipework should be disinfected to keep biofilms from building up at any angles or connections, as pipes can harbor pathogens that will contaminate feeds that pass through them in the future. Equipment must be regularly checked for wear and tear, and parts that are likely to break down must be replaced. For instance, valve rubbers deteriorate, so a regular program of maintenance should be incorporated into the farm routine. A stock of the parts that most commonly need replacing should also be maintained, and parts should be reordered once a unit is used. When mixing complete diets, dry ingredients should be stored separately to prevent water ingress and mold growth. Insects, birds and rodents must not be able to access feed storage or mixing and processing areas. A prevention and eradication program should be in place, including physical barriers to entry, to avoid contaminating feces and urine, which spread disease. Wet feeds are particularly at risk of fecal contamination from wild birds, so to prevent this, all storage tanks must be covered. Wet feeds should be fed immediately after mixing, as their high water content means they will rapidly start to ferment and spoil. Troughs used for these types of diets must be regularly cleaned to prevent the buildup of stale food, which can increase feed refusals. To ensure that all wet feeds are consumed completely by pigs under ad lib feeding systems, delivery valves should be switched off for appropriate periods of time (i.e., for one to two hours at the end of peak feeding activity). Feeding equipment must be cleaned and disinfected between batches of pigs to prevent any cross-contamination of mycotoxins or pathogens. Stricter hygiene procedures should be observed during hot and humid conditions of feed storage and when using wet feed, as these conditions promote more rapid growth of molds and the multiplication of pathogens.

The application of amino acid-based solutions is a first-string approach to mitigating damage caused by dropping temperatures and frost. In the town of Farroupilha (in the state of Rio Grande do Sul), Brazil, peach and grape farmer Fabiano Anselmi uses Alltech Crop Science solutions and observed improved crop development. \"The physiological stress was greatly reduced,” said Anselmi. “The plants’ color improved, becoming greener.” According to agronomist Marcos Revoredo, an Alltech Crop Science technical manager specializing in fruits and vegetables, \"When amino acids are supplied to the plant, they promote an activation or an acceleration of the plant’s metabolism. Consequently, there is an increase in the internal temperature of the cellular content and of the freezing point. Thus, it is possible to minimize the impacts of low temperatures and frost.” However, applications should be performed preventively. “It is important that the plants are treated weekly during the winter period, before the temperature drops,” said Revoredo. The amino acids can be complexed with nutrients such as calcium, magnesium and boron to enhance the results. Additionally, management practices such as using a plastic cover to avoid abrupt drops in temperature, nocturnal irrigation and other field measures can make the environment more favorable for helping the crops overcome winter challenges.

Whether you are choosing the seeds for your next crop or have just finished harvesting your fields, planning your sustainable soil management strategies should always be top of mind. Through seasons of use, soils can become depleted of nutrients and organic matter. If left unattended, this will lead to a decrease in yields for the grower. Additionally, soil depletion is not a phenomenon that is limited to the farmer; the home grower and gardener can face the same issues in their own front or backyards. Proactive growers work for their soil to ensure that it works for them. Healthy soil — which is soil that has a high organic matter content, a balanced structure and high nutrient availability — provides an excellent basis for plants. It can decrease the amount of inputs that a grower needs to use, since many of the nutritional requirements of the crops will already be supplied through the soil. This increased nutrient availability can also help plants to develop stronger roots and become naturally more resistant to environmental stressors. The four tips included below will help increase your soil health in a sustainable way and will lead to noticeable improvements for years to come. Increase soil organic matter Between all the animals (like worms and insects) and the millions of microbes that make their homes in the ground, healthy soil is teeming with life. Each of these creatures plays a role in nutrient cycling, which is the process of breaking down crop residue, such as corn stubble, and degrading it into organic matter in the soil. Once the breakdown process is complete, the nutrients then become available for use by the plants. When plants use the nutrients that are available in the soil, growers can begin using more specific additives and fertilizers instead of deploying widespread “just in case” spraying. Minimize tillage Tilling can damage the soil environment and should only be used to improve problem areas, including where the soil is compacted or where drainage issues are heavily impacting the fields. Tilling can also increase the number of weeds in a field by bringing them to the surface, where they can germinate and grow. These weeds will compete with the intended crop for nutrients and take over precious field space, potentially decreasing crop yields. Keep the surface of the soil covered Using cover crops has become increasingly popular, and for good reason. Not only do cover crops offer another opportunity for growers to improve their soil makeup, since their use increases the availability of nutrients like nitrogen in the soil, but they also significantly reduce the likelihood of soil erosion. When fields are kept uncovered after harvest and during the winter, they become susceptible to erosion from wind and rain, which leaves the grower a step behind in building a healthy foundation for springtime crops. Rotate crops The type and amount of nutrients used by different crops will vary depending on which crop is being grown. Different crops also will increase the availability of different nutrients, which can be used by the crops that follow. Crop rotation also plays a part in preventing soil erosion. Not only does the field remain covered, but as each crop’s roots grow to varying lengths, they will hold onto the soil at different depths throughout the seasons, maintaining stability against heavier rains and winds. While these steps are great ways to improve your soil and ensure that it will continue to be the hardworking first step toward producing a healthy plant and a profitable yield, their results can be maximized when combined with other management tools. Soil testing throughout your fields, for instance, will help you pinpoint areas of concern. Field scouting during the growing season will help the grower catch any areas where there might be a nutrient deficiency or disease pressure before the problem becomes widespread and requires more intervention. By combining all the tools at their disposal, growers can give crops the best possible foundation for seasons to come in a proactive and sustainable way. Want to learn more?

The answer would take the form of a 79-day, head-to-head barrel trial using two control and two separately treated barrels of tender sweet corn. Soil-Set® was applied to both of the treated barrels at planting and resulted in a greater initial take-off during the first week — when compared to the two control barrels — and were later treated with Grain-Set® and Liqui-Plex®Zn. “The plants in the treated barrels were uniform in size and larger than those in either of the control barrels,” says Springer. “We also saw 100 percent emergence in the ACS barrels, whereas one of the control barrels only reached 67 percent emergence. This is a trend we continued to see throughout the trial.” Drought conditions soon set in, with 10 days of no water and temperatures of 100°F (37°C), and the ACS-treated barrels stood out significantly. “The treated plants stood back up after the drought stress and produced corn,” says Springer. “We also found that the root systems in the treated plants were significantly larger and resulted in greater yield than the control plants. “Not only was the dealer surprised, but so were all the customers who visited the dealership everyday to buy feed or other farm needs,\" continues Springer. \"They understand that fields produce differently, but now they see it’s possible to improve their soils in a cost-effective way, to compete with anyone.” Barrel trial using two control and two separately treated barrels of tender sweet corn.

How many of us are brushing our pet’s teeth? We have good intentions. We buy the floss for ourselves but don’t use it regularly. We may even add the doggie dental care kit to our Amazon order, but we have a hard enough time taking care of our own teeth (ahem, unused floss). In fact, according to Packaged Facts, only 20 percent of dog owners and 11 percent of cat owners brush their pet’s teeth at all! If you’re on the receiving end of doggie affection, you know why this is important. No one likes bad breath, even if the offender is your best fur friend. Pet maladies: A malodorous cue? But bad breath is more than just offensive to us; it can be an indication of a more serious health issue. According to Banfield Pet Hospital’s State of Pet Health Report 2016, 76 percent of dogs and 68 percent of cats are affected by dental disease, which not only impacts the teeth, gums and mouth, but can potentially affect a pet’s heart, liver and kidneys. Brushing and professional teeth cleaning are key to oral and dental health, but treats, chews and supplements can also play a significant role. Building a pet’s immune defenses with the right nutrition is critical for oral health. Perfecting your pet’s pearly whites The form of the pet diet is important. Hard kibble cleans teeth better than wet foods. Composition is also critical. Nutrition influences tooth, bone and mucosal integrity, oral bacterial composition, resistance to infection and tooth longevity. A nutritionally adequate diet will prevent any mineral or vitamin deficiencies, but we can do better. By providing our pets with ingredients that support immunity, prebiotics like Bio-Mos® and probiotic bacteria help support gut health and nutrient absorption. Bio-Mos is designed to feed the gastrointestinal tract, promoting beneficial bacteria and building natural defenses. Feeding organic trace minerals like Bioplex® and Sel-Plex® ensure our pets absorb the minerals in a way that their bodies can fully utilize. Immunity starts in the gut, but it affects a pet’s entire body, including its oral and dental health. Place that Amazon order for a doggie or kitty dental care kit, but don’t ignore what’s going into the food bowl.

Fusaric acid was high in frequency, and there were particularly high levels of deoxynivalenol (DON), type A trichothecenes (T-2) and fumonisin. How do mycotoxins affect pigs? Young pigs and breeding sows/boars are generally the most susceptible to mycotoxins. The presence of mycotoxins, even at low levels in feed, reduces performance in growing and breeding animals, affects immune and health status, and can ultimately lead to death. Irreversible tissue damage occurs that can impair pig performance even when mycotoxins are no longer in the feed. Our previous blog highlighted some symptoms from DON and T-2, but what about fusaric acid and fumonisin? Fusaric acid Fusaric acid is produced by Fusarium mold species that are widespread in corn-based feed. Some effects of the mycotoxin include vomiting, lethargy, reduced blood pressure and swelling of extremities. It is important to note that the toxicity of fusaric acid is significantly enhanced when the feed is co-contaminated with mycotoxins such as type B trichothecenes and DON. Fumonisin Fumonisin is also produced by Fusarium mold species that are common natural contaminants of corn. Some effects of fumonisin include pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs), diarrhea, lethargy, liver damage, reduced milk production in sows, decreased feed efficiency and feed growth, and immune suppression. “Fumonisins could also alter gut-pathogen interactions, which can lead to an increase in the severity and susceptibility to pathogens such as E. coli and Salmonella,” noted Dr. Alexandra Weaver, mycotoxin management expert at Alltech. Is it a threat to your feed? By understanding mycotoxin contamination in more detail, it is possible to assess the risk posed by the specific ingredient or finished feed.

Crop emergence is the first predictor of crop success. The number of seeds that germinate and grow has a direct correlation to the total yield and quality. Therefore, it is important to take steps not only during the pre-emergence, but also in the previous growing and harvest periods, that will benefit the plants throughout the growing season. Soil preparation Preparing your soil begins during the previous season. The use of practices that promote the improvement and biological balance in the soil, such as cover crops, crop rotation and natural fertilizers, improves the soil. Optimal soil quality will help plants reach their full genetic potential and better face environmental stressors. The amount of crop residue can also affect emergence since it can keep the temperature of the soil significantly lower. Growers should take the time to break down the material, which will also provide additional nutrients to the soil. Field preparation After improving soil health, it is time to properly prepare the field itself for planting. A soil test is recommended to check what nutrients — both macro and micro — may be low. During the pre-emergence period, it is also time to begin scouting the fields for early signs of weeds. Growers should not only look for weeds that are beginning to break through, but also dig for weed seeds as well. Field borders can be a good place to check for signs of potential weed problems. Seed selection To make sure the crop emerges properly and in a timely fashion, the right variety of seed should be used. The chosen variety should work well for the soil type, the growing environment and the grower’s end market goals. For example, if the area is prone to stressors like temperature fluctuations, a seed that is rated for emergence stressors should be used. Timing Timing is integral to ensure that the crop emerges correctly. Planting too early or too late can be detrimental to the overall yield and crop quality. Some crops, such as soybeans, perform better if they are planted a bit early. Temperature Keeping an eye on soil temperature will ensure a better emergence of your plants. Cold temperatures will stress the seeds and decrease the number of plants that will reach maturity. Growers should monitor the temperature at planting depth, and if it is a cold and wet period, planting should be stopped, if possible, until more favorable conditions are present. The attention in preparing the soil and field, finding the right seeds and ensuring correct timing and weather conditions will help growers get a leg up in ensuring that their seeds emerge into viable plants.

We interviewed two experts who were present at the forum to hear their takeaways from the event. Mineral quality over quantity Dr. Vaughn Holder, ruminant research director at Alltech, was interested in the discussion surrounding the levels of minerals in supplements. “The key point to take away from this forum is that you cannot judge a bag of mineral supplements by its cover,” said Holder. “The fact that a certain bag has higher levels of minerals in it does not mean it should be worth more to your enterprise. It is more about the quality of the components that are inside of the bag, and sometimes you can get away with using much lower levels of quality minerals and actually achieve better results. Remember, sometimes less is more!” The saying “less is more” is one that we hear often, but not always when it comes to mineral supplementation. Holder emphasizes the fact that some companies focus strictly on quantity of minerals, not necessarily quality. However, in a University of Florida study featuring Alltech’s Bioplex® and Sel-Plex® organic trace minerals, it was found that, even when included at lower rates than their inorganic counterparts, Alltech organic trace minerals still managed to outperform the standard mineral in various areas, including weaning weights, pregnancy rates and even colostrum quality. For a full recap of this study, which was featured in the February issue of Progressive Cattleman magazine, click here. Mineral antagonists Another point discussed during the forum was the concept of “mineral antagonists,” a complex-sounding topic that is actually very simple — something that blocks or decreases the absorption rate or metabolic function of a nutrient. We pulled in Mark Robbins, manager of research and technical services at Ridley Block Operations (the makers of CRYSTALYX®), to speak on the issue. “If you have mineral antagonists, which is where you have situations in which inorganic trace minerals aren’t your best option, the Blueprint® program that we have formulated with Total Replacement Technology™ using organic trace minerals is the way to go,” he said. Research has shown that certain organic trace mineral complexes resemble those found naturally in plant proteins, and this may be the reason that they do not act as antagonists in the ration.

The challenges of modern production practices can restrict the diversity of the gastrointestinal microflora, in some instances resulting in an unhealthy imbalance, which can lead to the development of a vicious cycle of pathogen colonization and recolonization. Producers must utilize nutritional strategies, with additional improvements in hygiene and husbandry to address the issue of antibiotic use in animal production. During a webinar held in conjunction with Pig Progress, Dr. Richard Murphy, research director at Alltech’s European Bioscience Centre in Dunboyne, Ireland, discussed the nutritional rehabilitation and repair of the intestinal microflora in pig production. “Gut health and its management is an intricate and complex area governed by numerous factors, including nutrition, microbiology, immunology and physiology,” said Murphy. “When gastrointestinal health is compromised, nutrient digestion and absorption are affected, feed conversion becomes reduced and susceptibility to disease is heightened, ultimately resulting in a negative economic impact.” Diversify and repair the pig microbiome for strengthened immunity Murphy highlighted that the diversity of the microbiome plays a critical role in gut health, with beneficial microbes forming a protective barrier lining the gut that prevents the growth of pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella, Campylobacter, Clostridia and Escherichia, amongst others. Microbial diversity: The key to gut health Murphy discussed four ways to rehabilitate the intestinal microbiota: Normalize gut microflora: Enhance microbial diversity Shift the balance: Reduce pathogen load Break the cycle: Decrease antimicrobial resistance Feed the recovery: Enhance nutrient digestibility One way to address microbial repair is to use a feed supplement that focuses on diversifying and stabilizing the gut microflora. Mannan-rich fractions (MRFs) isolated from the yeast cell wall as a functional ingredient are currently being used for microbial control. “The effects of MRF supplementation on health and performance have been studied comprehensively, and they have proven effective at improving weight gain and feed conversion efficiencies while also protecting against pathogen colonization of the gut,” stated Murphy. Optimal pig performance begins in the gut By making changes in the overall microbial diversity within the gut, we can aim to repair and rehabilitate gut microflora, thereby reducing pathogen load, enhancing resistance to pathogen colonization and reducing the abundance of antibiotic-resistant strains. Improving our understanding of how changes in the gastrointestinal tract’s bacterial composition contribute to host health and performance is critical.

Scott’s family continues to use Grandmother Wood’s recipe for every summer holiday celebration, from Memorial Day to the Fourth of July to Labor Day, and especially for family birthdays. Even friends of the family expect it to be at every gathering! “I remember, growing up, my mother making it, and the sound of the electric freezer running in the kitchen,” said Scott. “The best part is licking the paddle after the ice cream is frozen. Now my kids enjoy doing that, just as I did.” Today, the Holloways have an old White Mountain hand-crank freezer that makes the magic happen. He says it’s fun to use, even though it’s hard work, and the end result of rich, creamy ice cream is worth the effort. Over the years, the family has experimented with delicious changes on the basic recipe. Scott’s favorite flavor is chocolate, although his grandmother, Grandma Kay, makes an excellent Butterfinger recipe that is a family favorite. Scott says that the best part about the ice cream was always the fresh milk used from their own family dairy herd. His grandfather started the dairy in 1971, when they milked about 150 Brown Swiss and Holstein cows. Scott’s father and Scott himself both came back and worked at the dairy, too, until they sold in 2014.

Weaning on dry feeds with an unbalanced diet can result in deformities and high mortality rates. High-quality starter diets are therefore essential. Providing nutritional solutions for the specific needs of larvae in their most critical life stage benefits the fish during their entire lifecycle. Supporting the healthy development of all organs, including the skeleton, for an ideal start begins with optimal nutrition. Extensive studies at the Alltech Coppens Aqua Centre have revealed the essentials for a weaning diet, which will significantly minimize deformations in sensitive fish species. This allows us to wean fish larvae with confidence knowing that the vast majority will fully develop into healthy fry without any abnormalities. Three things producers look for in starter feeds: High survival rate and minimal deformities Optimal skeleton development as a foundation for future growth High digestibility for optimal performance and water quality Benefits for hatcheries and farms By delivering nutrients in a way that can be handled easily by the maturing digestive tract of fresh water larvae, we can offer hatcheries more security when weaning freshwater larvae from Artemiaonto a dry diet. Deformities can be scaled back to a minimum with a more even growth rate, thereby resulting in less frequent grading. The end results are healthy larvae and fry, more revenue, more efficiency and less work. A new generation of starter diets Alltech and Coppens International are working closely together to bring a new generation of fish feed to the marketplace. Coppens’ Essence, designed with Alltech’s Total Replacement Technology™ and gut health technologies containing Bioplex® and Bio-Mos®, reflects this approach. Through highly bioavailable, organically bound trace elements, we can ensure optimal skeleton development with a special larval diet that can largely replace live Artemia. Essence also promotes optimal tissue development which reduces factors associated with deformity and low fry survival rates, making this feed truly unique. Due to its high digestibility and excellent performance, this starter diet is ideal for recirculation aquaculture system farming conditions. Essence is tailored to the specific needs of the early life stage of many freshwater fish, such as cyprinids, pikeperch, catfish, tilapia and koi, which are characterized by many as living jewels.

Temperatures have plummeted, and snowmen are popping up around the countryside. No matter where in the world you might be having a snow day, looking after calves properly in a winter wonderland will ensure growth rates do not decline. Remember: The heifer calf is the future of the dairy herd and will determine the potential future production of the herd, no matter what the weather! During this cold spell, calf management should be a priority on-farm. The InTouch Calf Programme offers focuses on four key areas for healthy growth in cold weather, including: Colostrum Early nutrition and energy intake Environment Immunity Colostrum We only have one opportunity to maximise the benefits a calf receives from colostrum. Colostrum is a nutrient-rich material containing immunoglobulins (antibodies) that are necessary for the newborn calf. A calf’s immune system is not fully functional until 1 to 2 months of age, so calves are dependent on the passive transfer of antibodies from the cow to protect them until this time. The ability to absorb colostrum is at its highest in the first hour after birth and ceases at 24 hours. It is important, especially during cold weather, to bottle feed or stomach tube feed at least 3 litres of colostrum and give a second feeding eight hours later before transitioning to milk or calf milk replacer. 2. Early nutrition Milk In order to maintain growth and achieve a target of up to 0.6 kilograms of weight gain per day, aim to feed 15 percent of bodyweight (for a 40-kilogram calf, this equals 6 litres of milk per day). Calves require approximately 325 grams of milk solids for maintenance in thermoneutral temperatures. Calves weighing 40 kilograms on 4 litres of milk per day (which is 10 percent of their bodyweight) can achieve 200 grams of growth per day. However, calves weighing more than 40 kilograms will struggle to maintain weight on this amount. Milk replacer has lower fat and energy content, and a larger volume is therefore needed. Calf milk replacer When mixing milk powder, always remember that it takes 125 grams of powder to make up to 1 litre of milk replacer, not 125 grams of powder added to 1 litre of water. Milk replacer should be matched to growth targets. In cold weather, milk solids should be increased 100 grams per day for every 10 degrees that the temperature drops below 20 degrees. Milk can be fed more frequently and at higher concentrations. Calves require more milk for maintenance in cold weather. The thermoneutral zone for calves less than 3 weeks of age is 15 to 20 degrees Celsius. For calves that are older, the low critical temperature is 5 degrees Celsius. Every degree below 10 degrees Celsius requires 2 percent more energy in the newborn calf; a temperature of 0 degrees Celsius requires 20 percent more feed. Fat content in calf milk replacer can be increased 2 to 3 percent in cold weather. Below freezing, daily energy requirements can increase by up to 30 percent. Draughts or wind chill can exacerbate this and will have the same effect as a drop in temperature. Water Ensure water troughs are not frozen. Water should always be freely available for calves in addition to the water that is consumed through liquid milk feeding. Environment Environment is a crucial factor in cold weather. Rest and space are a priority for calves, as they spend 80 percent of their time lying down. Housing Ensure calves are comfortable in their environment, with plentiful dry bedding and shelter from draughts and breezes. Thermal calf jackets can be a very useful addition to keep calves warm and maintain body heat. If calves are huddling in corners of the pen, adjust shelter accordingly and use bales to create shelter corners in the pen if necessary. Pen or group changes should be kept to a minimum to reduce stress. Immunity Adequate colostrum, as explained above, clean calving areas and a well-ventilated, hygienic calf shed environment will go far in preventing scours and respiratory diseases, along with using correct vaccinations.

Doctoring lots of calves is a nightmare. For producers, nothing takes more time or creates more stress than seeing sick cattle. So how do you get ahead of the problem and address herd health and immunity before it's too late? In a recent webinar, Dr. Kate Jacques, Alltech’s director of nutrition, shared how to bolster herd immunity and increase profitability. Strike Out Scours, Fight Down Stress Webinar Key tips for bolstering your herd’s immunity Identify stress points When it comes to boosting immunity, “Stress is the enemy,” said Dr. Jacques. Scours, respiratory issues or decreases in dry matter intake are all indicators that cattle may be stressed. The first thing to do is identify the source of stress. Common stress points include: Weaning New pens, chutes or feed bunks Movement through marketing channels Shipment – both to pasture and feedlot Diet changes Keeping cattle healthy and maximizing growth means getting them through a number of crunch points before finish. Rethinking how to best handle these stressors is a continual process, but it is critically important to do so to keep immunity high. Boost gut health through nutrition Feeding some form of starch, fiber, protein and mineral is typical in most rations, but realizing the opportunity other nutrient forms can play shouldn’t be overlooked. Bio-Mos® provides a new perspective on carbohydrate nutrition. Bio-Mos is in a unique class of functional feed ingredients able to play a positive role in gut health. “If you can reduce challenges to the intestine, you can promote a healthy gut, and that’s exactly what Bio-Mos does,\" said Dr. Jacques. For over 20 years, Bio-Mos has been Alltech’s trademark technology. Studied in more than 733 research trials, it has been proven to aid nutrient uptake while also binding potentially harmful gut bacteria to drive growth and performance at all stages of production. Put a plan in place; Act on it At the end of the day, there’s a tension between knowing something is a best practice for your operation and actually doing it. Dr. Jacques stressed that producers need to be strategic and that waiting to spot a problem means that profits have already been lost. To best boost immunity, analyze your operation’s potential stress points and use technologies like Bio-Mos in the ration before a gut health or immunity challenge. Trust that with proper management and nutrition, profits will follow. Like thousands of others across, producers such as Clifton Goff of B-Gee Angus in Nebraska have seen the benefits of having a plan and using Bio-Mos. He explains that by using Bio-Mos they’ve, “got a healthy herd of calves running, and I haven’t dealt with anything respiratory.” By being proactive, you can fight a mess of stress in your operation and boost your herd’s immunity.

Over the course of the last 12 months, Alltech Coppens has progressively replaced the fish oil source of DHA in its diets with Alltech’s innovative, DHA-rich algae technology, ForPlus™. “Aquaculture is the fastest-growing food sector in the world,” said Patrick Charlton, CEO of Alltech Coppens. “People are consuming more fish, but they want that fish to be produced sustainably, so the goal of many companies, including our own, has been to significantly reduce reliance on fish-derived products such as fish oil and fish meal. “Research done in multiple species with Alltech’s ForPlus has enabled us to reformulate our diets,” continued Charlton. “Our aim is to replace all of our DHA requirements in our fish feeds with ForPlus by the end of this year. In fact, we are already marketing a range of trout feeds under the Neogreen brand that include Alltech’s revolutionary ForPlus and have absolutely no fish-based raw materials in them, and these have been very well-received by the market. We expect to expand this technology into other fish species based on the success we have seen with trout.” This positions Alltech Coppens well to weather increasing pressures on the aquaculture industry from consumers and limited resources. “These are exactly the steps the aquafeed industry needs to be taking to ensure our fish supplies remain sustainable and financially viable,” stated Dr. Patrick Wall, professor of public health at University College Dublin’s School of Public Health and Population Sciences, which hosts Ireland’s National Nutrition Surveillance Centre. “We cannot keep feeding fish back to fish and expect the consumer to turn a blind eye. The goal of all fish feed companies should be to minimize and ultimately remove all fish-based ingredients in their diets, and Alltech Coppens has clearly shown this can be done.” ForPlus is a completely traceable and sustainable source of high-DHA omega-3. By incorporating the algae technology into aquatic feeds, producers have an opportunity to offset the trend of declining DHA omega-3 levels in farmed fish and offer consumers a distinct, value-added functional food. Alltech Coppens gained compliance with the Aquaculture Stewardship Council in 2016, a confirmation of its reputation as an innovative, high-quality aquatic feed producer for almost a quarter century. With a strong production infrastructure in the heart of Europe, Alltech Coppens’ specialties include temperate and tropical marine and freshwater diets for a variety of juvenile and adult species, as well as top-quality ornamental, specialty and bait feeds, which are distributed to more than 60 countries.

Drawing from this experience, he explains the key things he looks for when inspecting a silage pile, and the steps farmers can take to avoid costly issues. Safety When I go on-farm for a bunker audit, the first thing I do is inspect the silage pile for any safety concerns. Large cracks, often found when there are two crops butted together, can come down, causing an avalanche or collapse. Are there overhangs? Tires falling down? Bales that could tip over? Always exercise extreme caution when around large piles. Mold Molds like Penicillium, Aspergillus and Fusarium are often found in corn silage and are common mycotoxin producers. Colorations can help us identify molds, especially in corn silage. White-to-red/pinkish molds are Fusarium, or field-borne, molds. Blue-green molds are typically Penicillium, which is more often storage-related but can occur in the field under certain weather conditions. Aspergillus, which is very common in dry climates, is olive green to yellow in color. When I observe large mold lines, I do not touch, inhale, grab or sample those areas. Many molds cause health issues to both animals and humans, and they can also produce a fair number of different mycotoxins. In humans and animals, Penicillium mold alone can cause dermal irritation as well as gut health complications if ingested. Mycotoxins can also cause performance and reproductive problems. Facing Increased surface area permits more oxygen to penetrate the feed, triggering mold and yeast growth, which increases heating. We look for a smooth face, with little loose material at the base and edges. The proper facing and feed out equipment can help reduce shrinkage. A shaver provides a very smooth and clean face and can help reduce losses with proper management. Rakes or claws will cause tine marks, increasing surface area, but they do limit oxygen penetration during facing. Finally, bucket facing leads to a lot of oxygen penetration due to lifting the pile face. Infrared inspection Along with evaluating facing techniques, we utilize infrared cameras for hot spot detection on the piles. These cameras are used to look for areas of aerobic instability that could be due to yeast, mold, bacteria or even the management of facing practices. Shavers tend to not allow oxygen very deep into piles. Rakes and buckets can allow oxygen into the piles, resulting in quicker spoilage. Other issues we see on infrared cameras are yeasts. Yeasts have a tendency to show up as a large bubble on the images and, being water soluble, will drain down the pile. Yeast can contaminate the top and then drain down through the face. In contrast, molds have a tendency to grow in a linear or spherical fashion. This means molds will stay more toward the top of the pile and will develop in lines. Plastic We also look at how well the plastic has been managed. Has it been pulled back too far? How many sheets are being used? Are the tires touching? Are the sides covered well and is the plastic pulled out with sand around the edges if it’s a drive-over pile? Or is it a bunker in which the plastic has been, at the very least, run down the walls and double overlaid? Due to the curvature of the pile surface area, taking proper precautions and good management of the top of the pile can result in reducing up to a third of spoilage and oxygen penetration: Tires: You don’t want to see large spaces between tires; in fact, the tires should nearly be touching. For ease of weight and placement, side walls work the best and reduce water-holding capacity, which can encourage bugs and pathogens. Plastic: One black and white sheet with an oxygen barrier film, or two layers of black and white plastic, will protect the top of the forage from the elements and discourage animals from penetrating your feed. Cutting: Depending on height, conditions and other safety factors, try to keep the plastic cut 6 inches to 1 foot from the face edge. Two to three feet is common, but air, rain and other weather conditions can truly damage your forage when it is exposed to the elements. Treatment: Most spoilage occurs at the top of the pile, where the packing density isn’t as high. A mold inhibitor can help counter the impact of increased oxygen flow in this area. Up to 60 percent of the average farm’s expenses are feed-related. By increasing the quality of your forage and reducing shrinkage, considerable cost savings can be achieved without even leaving the farm.

However, over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that the complex community of microorganisms residing in the GI tract not only influences digestive processes but also significantly impacts long-term and short-term health. For optimum well-being, it is important to maintain an appropriate balance in the intestinal microflora. But what is that balance, and how do we support it? Nutrition for a balanced GI tract With the realization of the importance of microflora have come new nutritional strategies that influence microbial balance. Many are based on simple supplementation or diet changes, but their effects can be profound. These approaches are revolutionizing not only the way we view our gastrointestinal health, but also that of our animal companions. Digestive aids that include specific feed ingredients, exogenous enzymes, probiotics, organic acids and plant-derived oils can be coupled with nutritional management practices to beneficially manipulate intestinal microbial populations. One of the most successful documented uses has been supplementation with small doses of yeast-based polysaccharides (prebiotic fibers) to influence the composition of the gastrointestinal microbial population. We know that these supplementation strategies not only limit the proliferation of detrimental bacteria and pathogens but are also associated with improved immune function and nutrient absorption. These approaches allow us to eat our way to improved health, but how exactly they work had not been understood…until recently. The science behind the nutrition revolution A nutritional revolution is at hand, with new tools for reliably demonstrating and predicting how dietary and supplementation approaches can influence the intestinal microflora and gastrointestinal health. Detailed nucleic acid sequencing techniques now allow for an in-depth description of the composition, profile and function of the most beneficial microbial populations in the intestinal tract. It is now possible to clearly pinpoint the effects of nutrition on the critical components of these complex populations and to determine the most effective balance of intestinal gut microbes. Rather than focusing on individual types of microorganisms, these techniques allow us to identify the optimal microbial populations that promote good intestinal health. This clarity takes the guesswork out of diet formulation and can strategically improve health, from the most minuscule gut microbes to overall well-being.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/feeding-pets-good-microbes","title":"\n\n                    Feeding pets the good microbes \n                    ","date":"April 2, 2018","contentLength":411}},{"pageContent":"Companion animals have now become an extension of the family. It should come as no surprise, then, that many pet parents would say their pet’s nutrition is just as important as their own. They pay as much attention to the ingredients in their pet food as they do to the food they put on the dinner table. Superfoods make it into the doggie dish Consumers are gravitating to “superfoods” that tout beneficial effects on the human body, and they want the same for their dogs and cats. Functional foods now starring in the ingredient lists of pet food include: Blueberries: Identified as a source of antioxidants, they can be found in dry dog food. Carrots: Known for having beta-carotene, they can be found as a principle vegetable ingredient in pet food and can be given as a treat to dogs in their raw or cooked form. Pumpkins: In the fall, when we are all inundated with pumpkin and pumpkin spice products, even pet food is not immune. Pumpkin is a good source of soluble fiber with beneficial digestive properties. Sustainability: Supporting a positive cycle of “good” for pets and the planet Sustainability is a concept that has become increasingly important to consumers when thinking about their own food. They want to know not only how nutritious their food is, but also what practices were used to grow the vegetables and feed the animals that are nourishing their bodies. This concern extends to pet food ingredients and how the grains, vegetables and fruits (and superfoods) were grown. From this standpoint, the management practices used on the farm are very important to the concept of sustainability. When a plant is stressed, whether from environmental factors, disease pressure or micronutrient deficiency, it lacks the necessary ingredients to attain its peak performance. This can result in subpar yield, size, flavor and texture. Growers will invariably use synthetic products to try and combat these deficiencies. However, a more sustainable approach will incorporate the use of products that are naturally based, with substances such as amino acids that enable micronutrients to be more readily available to plants, increasing their ability to fight stressors. The plant becomes stronger, and, by using these natural products, growers also limit residues that could be left on the fruits and vegetables that go into the pet food. The process is cyclical. By using sustainable practices that protect the soil, such as cover crops, crop rotation and precision agriculture, growers create a more active soil microbiome filled with beneficial microorganisms that help provide micronutrients to the plants. These micronutrients, in conjunction with natural plant biostimulant products, improve a plant’s resistance to stressors and help the plant protect itself. This in turn decreases the need for pesticides and other synthetic products that leave residues in the ground, on the field and in the food. Plants raised on healthy soils with the micronutrients needed for plant health, supplemented with naturally based fertilizer as needed, have increased nutritional value. Meanwhile, these farming practices also improve the environmental footprint of the crop itself so you can be confident that your pets’ food is not only good for them, but for the planet, too.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/crop-canine-sustainable-pet-food-starts-soil","title":"\n\n                    Crop to canine: Sustainable pet food starts in the soil   \n                    ","date":"February 20, 2018","contentLength":530}},{"pageContent":"When we talk about the balancing act of a healthy gastrointestinal tract, we want to make sure that calories, colostrum, cleanliness, comfort, the strength of the immune system and the health of the gut flora outweigh the pathogens that may invade the gastrointestinal tract of calves. In a recent webinar, Dr. Corale Dorn, a veterinarian at Dells Veterinary Services in Dell Rapids, South Dakota, explained how using proper management practices and keeping an eye out for diseases are key to tipping the scales in the right direction for healthy calves. Calories We need to adjust our thinking from quarts to the number of calories that calves are receiving through milk replacer. “When I go out to a farm in the dead of winter in South Dakota and they are only feeding 2 quarts of 20/20 milk replacer every 12 hours, I know we are not hitting anywhere near the calorie requirements that we need,” said Dorn. “If we are completely missing the mark on these calorie requirements, we cannot expect to maintain calf health when pathogens enter the herd.” If we are getting 2.1–2.5 pounds of average daily gain on Holstein calves, then we have enough calories to keep the calves healthy and growing. The calories and protein that they need depend on their weight and the temperature of their environment. For example, during the winter in South Dakota, we need to be feeding at least 6 quarts of milk a day. This can be pasteurized whole milk or 24/20 milk replacer. Re-evaluating our thinking when it comes to feeding calves for the calories they need can assist in their ability to endure seasonal changes and other challenges that can impact calf health. Colostrum It’s a given that calves need a good measure of colostrum beginning at calving. We know that when we take a blood sample at 24–48 hours post-calving, calves well-fed with colostrum should reach a calibrated total protein of 6.0 grams per deciliter For calves that require esophageal tubes, we need to make sure they are getting 1 gallon of colostrum within the first six hours of life. Not only is quantity key, but quality is equally important. Colostrum needs to be clean, high in immunoglobulin (IgG), low in bacteria and fed as soon possible. If colostrum is not fed within one hour, it needs to be cooled to less than 35 degrees Fahrenheit to prevent bacterial growth. Cleanliness A standard procedure to ensure milk bottles and nipples are properly cleaned is extremely important to reduce pathogen exposure to calves. It is also vital that the environment the calf comes into is managed properly to ensure cleanliness. “The maternity pen is the first place the calf is going to be, so ask yourself, can you kneel into the bedding and come out with dry knees?” asked Dorn. “If you have a large surge in calving, you can have a very dirty pen, so ensuring that pen is cleaned as frequently as necessary is important.” Calves should be moved to a clean “wet calf” area within the first 15 minutes of life before attempting to stand. Be sure to clean this area vigorously after every calf to prevent pathogens from spreading between calves. Comfort The thermo-neutral zone for a calf is 50–68 degrees Fahrenheit. In the winter, use calf jackets and deep bedding. In the summer, we start to get anxious when we have semi-opaque housing, as on hot days these hutches can get very hot if not ventilated properly. Looking at ways to provide additional ventilation and water to hutch calves during the summer months is key to keeping calves cool and comfortable. Immune system Everything we do impacts the health of the immune system. Normally, when bacteria invade the calf’s system, immune cells attack and swallow up the bad bacteria, destroying them. However, some bad bacteria can evade this immune response. “The problem with some of the bugs that enter the immune system, such as Salmonella, is that they have developed ways to invade the calf’s immune system by hitching a ride on the white blood cells,” explained Dorn. “Once bacteria join ranks with the white blood cells, we have a breach in the immune system and have bugs we can’t kill, with few medicines or vaccines that can slow down this process. This is where MOS products come into play. When bacteria attempt to attach to receptors on the intestinal wall, MOS blocks the attachment of these bacteria.” Stop bugs before they take hold in your livestock Long gone are the days we could just give calves a drug and kill the bug. Dorn advised dairy producers to: Keep the maternity pen clean. Be sure to test the bedding regularly to ensure it is not too damp. Ensure calves are well-fed! Remember, calves need an adequate supply of energy not only to fuel metabolic activity, but to support their developing immune system.

To listen to our entire conversation with Dan, click on the player. Can you start by telling us a little bit about why grazing management is important to the cattle industry? The grasslands, or forage base, are the largest nutritional input for beef cattle operations, primarily within the cow-calf sector. Being the largest component of their diet, managing the forage properly becomes very important in terms of your herd production level as well as the economic returns from the land. What are some ways that people can implement a successful grazing management program? There are a number of different steps for improving forage management. Primarily, if you take a look at the grasslands, you want to make sure there is ample forage for cattle grazing, and all considerations should be given for managing the forage resource. When you manage cattle on grass, you want to take a look at the season of forage production, particularly when the forage or grasses are actively growing. Then, how is it that you can optimize how that forage is harvested by your livestock? We often see certain areas within a location of a pasture that are not utilized or are underutilized in terms of the cattle. They don’t tend to go there for different reasons. They may not prefer the grass species that’s there or the terrain might be a little too rugged for them to actually get there. Some of the ways you can take a look at that, and we have done considerable research in this area, are by using block supplements, very palatable supplements that cattle seek out, and place those supplements in those areas and improve the forage utilization. We have seen as high as 15 percent improvement in the utilization of grasses in those locations that normally go underutilized, and now they are actually being harvested by the cattle. That’s in terms of up to a 600-yard or 600-meter radius from where you place those supplements. There is certainly an environmental impact to this as well. Can you talk a little bit about that? Yeah, in terms of impacting the environment by locating the supplements that you provide, one of the strongest things is as an attractant to those supplements. Cattle want to spend time by them. If you have grasslands that have waterways in them, or what a lot of people refer to as riparian areas, they (cattle) can do damage to the stream banks if they spend a lot of time down in those areas. Cattle tend to migrate there unless you give them a reason to stay off those areas by moving supplements further up out in the grasslands, where you want to have the cattle grazing. You can help protect those sensitive areas in terms of the environment. The other thing that happens is, if you can better utilize the entire forage base, you just optimize your production from that land resource. You get more utilization of your forage base by using these supplements and putting them in strategic locations throughout your pasture. You even have a block technology, the BioBarrel®, that is completely biodegradable. Want to talk a little bit about that as well? Oftentimes, in placement of supplements, one of the battles producers face is the containers those supplements are in. What we have developed is a degradable container that, basically as the cattle consume the supplement, the container disappears or just goes away. There is no need to go back and pick it up; it just degrades into the environment. Some of those containers are actually consumed by the cattle because it is fiber-based. Ruminant animals have that ability to digest fiber, so they can consume the container and there are no problems with it. And there are no concerns with rain? No. One of the things we did in the past couple of years is we introduced a technology called WeatherAll®, which is a (food-grade) wax coating that is put on during the manufacturing process of the container. What that wax coating does is it really prevents any sort of seepage or moisture from coming into the container during weather events like heavy rainfall periods or even slow drizzle-type rains. That container stays in place and holds the supplements as it is supposed to and, again, it matches it to the degradation rate that the supplement disappears. Speaking of weather events, I want to segue to a recent article I read about the FAO using blocks as part of disaster recovery plans in certain countries. Do you want to comment a little bit about that and how blocks could be used as an operations plan for pending weather events or in recovery efforts? Mother Nature is always an issue that livestock producers have to work with, and the uncertainty of what’s going to happen is one of those occurrences where preparedness is your best friend. For supplements you can put out in the environment, especially if there is a pending weather event that’s coming, you are able to get that nutrition out there where cattle can actually access it, given an event that may come and you can’t get to them in a timely fashion. Being able to place (block) supplements out in the environment (that are consumed over days and weeks at a time), where the cattle are can certainly help so you’re not scrambling after the (weather) event to try to get those cattle fed. You mentioned WeatherAll®. What are some other new technologies, or are there other new technologies in blocks? There are always different ways for supplements to be fed. The traditional or conventional way is to try and look at what is in the diet of these grazing ruminants and find out what it is you can provide to improve their efficiency. Over the years, actual use of the blocks supplements has started to broaden out, and using the blocks for grazing management, moving cattle around, has been something in more recent years that has been developed. Additionally, using block supplements in confinement feeding — normally you think you bring all of the diet to those animals, why would you need a free-choice supplement? We have done work with the University of Wisconsin where we actually can provide low-moisture block supplement to dairy cows. The cows are high-producing dairy cows that are at risk, because of being fed high-starch diets, of subacute ruminal acidosis. By providing these blocks supplements that have buffering and alkalinizing agents in them, plus the ability for the cows to start licking the supplements to provide more buffering through their saliva production, we are able to help hold those cows (from reaching metabolic acidosis). We’ve got good documented proof, and actually a patent that’s been accepted, that it will hold them out of this acidosis condition. You maintain the health of the cow and improve milk production. Another area is (a direct result of) the palatability on these blocks being so great and cattle and livestock seek them out. When you start calves on feed, one of the biggest issues they have is just getting them up to the feed bunk and wanting them to consume feed. By providing a palatable low-moisture block supplement, we can get calves encouraged to lick that supplement and then that stimulates their appetite to get on feed quicker. We have been able to cut death loss and calves’ mortality in half and improve average daily gains by at least a quarter of a pound a day. There are different applications to the blocks that we see beyond the traditional “just supply the deficient nutrient and move on.” That’s fascinating, Dan, and very exciting. Before we wrap up, is there anything you would like to add about the future of block technology? I think that the future of the block technology is extremely bright because of the flexibility of the different sizes and packaging material we are able to start utilizing within the delivery of blocks. Then also the broadening out to other species like wildlife and some of the things we can do to help on the environment side. We recognize that greenhouse gas emissions, or methane production, by ruminant animals has been singled out as a culprit. For us to help improve the fermentation efficiency, we can help limit how much of the greenhouse gasses — methane — are produced (by improving fiber digestion through self-fed supplementation on pastures). From our perspective, we think there is a great chance for us to utilize these free-choice or self-fed blocks to help improve those efficiencies and reduce the greenhouse gas emissions. A very exciting future indeed. Thanks, Dan. Sure.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/ridley-block-operations-interview-block-nutrition-innovations-lead-new-applications","title":"\n\n                    Ridley Block Operations Interview: Block nutrition innovations lead to new applications, improvements in environmental sustainability\n                    ","date":"December 22, 2017","contentLength":1492}},{"pageContent":"In a recent webinar, Dr. Shelby Roberts, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Alltech Center for Animal Nutrigenomics and Applied Animal Nutrition, used her knowledge of ruminant health and immunology to take a closer look at calf gut health and the importance of nutrition during the first weeks of the calf’s life. Here are a few points to keep in mind in the midst of spring calving. 1. The importance of colostrum for the calf’s immune system Colostrum is the mother’s first milk and the calf’s first source of immunity and nutrients. Antibodies from colostrum protect calves until their immune systems are fully functional. However, the first couple weeks after birth can be a period of elevated risk as the maternal antibodies disappear and the calf’s immunity is maturing, as shown in the diagram. 2. The balancing act between pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria Good bacteria (e.g., lactobacilli, bifidobacteria) are constantly fighting to keep the pathogenic bacteria (e.g., E. coli, Salmonella) in check, but the immune system is also fighting the pathogenic bacteria. The immune system and the good bacteria work together to keep the cow healthy and to suppress the pathogenic bacteria. When antibiotics are used, this clears out the pathogenic bacteria AND the good bacteria. While recolonizing the gut, the cow is at risk for pathogenic bacteria recolonizing at a quicker rate than the good bacteria, leaving the immune system as the last and only line of defense when antibiotics are removed. 3. The new research behind Bio-Mos® is here Since the 1980s, Alltech has been conducting studies on its signature product, Bio-Mos. The calf research on Bio-Mos has shown the following results: Maintenance of gastrointestinal health Alteration of intestinal microbial populations Stimulation of immune activity Stimulation of the natural defenses of the animal When it comes to receiving diets, Bio-Mos has also been tested. In a study conducted in a commercial feedlot in Southern Alberta in Canada, 902 mixed-breed, newly weaned beef cattle were split into two groups, one fed a control and one supplemented with Bio-Mos. Cattle fed Bio-Mos showed improved average daily gain and maintained a healthy immune response.

Brave woman Lisa Murray, executive assistant to Dr. Mark Lyons, global vice president and head of Greater China at Alltech, comes from a long line of horsemen. She grew up in Cincinnati because that’s where her parents could find work. But the family's hearts were in their Eastern Kentucky hometown of Berea, where her uncle John Murray had a farm. “When I was 13, they thought I was old enough to handle myself and not be in the way, so I was allowed to go stay with him,” said Lisa. “And he was the man in my life that I looked up to — my dad’s oldest brother out of a family of 12.” Lisa’s formative years were devoted to riding in field trials and competing in the show horse industry. She could not have known in those days that she was on a path to a friendship that would endure through the brightest and the darkest moments of her life. The stars began aligning in 2001 when friends in Michigan had bred a foal, hoping for a winner in breed show performance classes, only to be informed by their trainer that the horse just didn’t have what it takes. Upon hearing this, Dr. Harv and Brenda Carlon thought of Lisa and her daughter. “Brenda approached me and said, ‘Hey, would you like him for Jeren? Maybe he could be a good 4-H project,’” Lisa recalled. Weeks later, the double-registered Tennessee Walking and Spotted Saddle Horse Repeat the Beat, aka “Pete,” was on his way south to Lisa, who then lived in the Franklin/Murfreesboro area of Tennessee. It was a difficult transition for Pete. Lisa had trail riding in mind. He had trouble fitting in. “He was kind of goofy,” she said. “He had only been in a show barn. He had never had any real-world experience out on a trail. So, his nickname was ‘Unpredictable Pete.’” A misunderstood horse It turned out, however, that instead of being a goofy hothead, Pete simply had been misunderstood, and there seemed to be no way to tell the humans in his life. The breakthrough came as he was turning 4, Lisa recalled. Friends visiting from Germany had taken Pete on a trail ride while she stayed behind to tend to chores. When they returned, they excitedly reported, “Wow! Pete can jump!” Pete was the first Tennessee Walking Horse ever invited to give a demonstration at the Rolex Kentucky Three-Day Event, pictured here with rider, Victoria Gomez. Lisa was sure they must be talking about her gray Arabian, a former jumper. She thought to herself, “Pete doesn’t know how to jump. He’s a Tennessee Walking Horse. Gaited horses don’t typically jump.” “I walked outside with them, and they had my whole field set up with jumps,” she said. “They said, ‘He jumps so nice!’” Until the visitors from Germany pointed it out, no one would have even tried to jump him, she said. By her own admission, Lisa knew nothing about jumpers. But after consulting other women who knew the ropes, she started taking Pete out to events all around the middle Tennessee region. “Initially, people would just stand and stare because when you see Pete next to a regular horse, first of all, he’s kind of small — he’s only 15 hands — but he’s this lit-up color that they’re not used to seeing,” she explained. Pete’s coat resembles that of a blue heeler dog: a roan body with a tail and mane of black and silver and some spots on his belly. He’s officially registered as a Black Roan Sabino. “But when you see him jump, that is the happiest horse on the planet,” Lisa said. “He’s very ‘ears forward,’ and everybody comments that he has this ‘tail flip’ as he lands from a jump. It’s obvious that he’s so happy.” Still, she wondered: “Why is this horse doing this? Why does he like it? How is he doing it?” Then she recognized that Pete’s body confirmation is such that he is actually built to jump. So, she started calling around to barns, asking for help, and nobody wanted to talk to her because Pete is a Tennessee Walking Horse, a breed that has been under a cloud of controversy over the practice by some in the industry of soring and the use of chains and pads to produce a distinctive show-ring gait. Pete had not been subjected to the practices, but as a registered Tennessee Walking Horse, he had been tarred with the same brush. And perhaps, as Lisa would later discover, deep down in his DNA was a sensitivity for those who have been abused. Lisa did eventually find a willing trainer. And, in 2004, the Carlons, thrilled to learn of his new career as a jumper, gifted Pete to her. She built a team to compete with Pete. It became a collaboration among a group of young riders, and eventually Pete won competition after competition. But not at first. Lost in the translation Anyone who shares space with an animal — a dog or cat, for example — knows that over time you find a way to communicate: a “lexicon.” Lisa and Pete developed theirs. “He has great respect for me,” she explained. “There are things that he’ll do for me that he won’t do for anyone else. We’re in synch.” This became crystal clear one day when Pete was taken to his first horse show and entered in the novice jumper class. “And he wouldn’t jump anything. He stopped at every jump and just stood there,” Lisa recalled with horror. The rider said, “I’m so sorry, I don’t understand. I’m talking to him, and every jump, he’s just: nope.” Lisa, wracking her brain for an explanation, asked, “What are you saying to him when you’re approaching the jump?” The rider said, “I’m just saying, ‘Easy, Pete, easy.’” It turned out that when trail riding, as Lisa and Pete approach a creek crossing or any obstacle, she always says to him, “Easy, Pete.” “He knows that every time he hears the word ‘easy,’ it means stop, assess the situation and then walk over it,” she said. The trainer returned Pete to the ring. “He went double-clear (no time or jumping penalties),” said Lisa. “He was brilliant.” Pete, and his rider Ashley Jones, under the training of Dauntless Performance Horses and Chelsea Kolman, in Ocala, Florida, Spring 2017.

In July, he became the official 2017 Breyer Horse model, a limited edition of his plastic likeness selling out at BreyerFest 2017, now in its 28th year at the Kentucky Horse Park. Pete and some of his former riders were on hand for the event, which drew an estimated crowd of 20,000, many children among them. And Pete likes kids. “He stood at that gate with his ears completely up, and when a child would come, he would lower himself to the level of the child,” said Lisa. Lisa attributes Pete’s fitness and good looks at age 18 to his customized diet of Alltech-owned McCauley's. feed and the company’s vitamin and mineral supplement, Trinergy®. “Pete needs a specific diet, and they answered all of my questions and came up with a fantastic plan for me,” she said. You’ve got a friend To fully understand the very special bond between Lisa and Pete, you have to dig a little deeper. Lisa’s first marriage to a horse trainer in 1985 was at the tender age of 19. They had a daughter, Jeren. The marriage, like many that begin at such an early age, ended in divorce in 1994. In the following years, Lisa devoted her energies to her daughter’s riding career, and, in 2003, Jeren, riding her own horse Ali Ali, won her first world championship. She went on to repeat the feat in 2004 and 2005. Jeren Guthrie McCluskey with three-time world champion Ali Ali. Photo Credit: Jack Greene Many years passed before Lisa would again feel comfortable about the commitment of marriage. The day came in 2007 when she married the Nashville-based Dutch sport horse trainer Arnold Warmels. In 2010, the decision was made to relocate Warmels’ training center, Fryslân Valley Sport Horses, to Lexington. They had been attracted to the Horse Capital of the World at a time when the city was buzzing with energy. For the first time in its history, the FEI World Equestrian Games, eight world championships in equestrian sport, were being hosted by the United States. And the events were to be held at the Kentucky Horse Park. It was through the Alltech FEI World Equestrian Games™ 2010 that Lisa became acquainted with the title sponsor, Alltech, and learned that the company was in search of an executive assistant to president and founder Dr. Pearse Lyons’ son, Mark. She was hired. Her first day on the job was Jan. 3, 2011. And within the year, Lisa’s life was suddenly and horrifically upended when abuse no one knew she had been enduring at home escalated into violence. It’s a story that she wants told in the hope that it will inspire other battered women to persevere and help drive changes and improvements in domestic violence law and support programming. What happened to Lisa on the night of Sept. 21, 2011, is summarized in the book “Violence Against Women in Kentucky: A History of U.S. and State Legislative Reform” by Carol E. Jordan, executive director of the University of Kentucky Office for Policy Studies on Violence Against Women. When Lisa Murray first met him (Warmels), he was like no man she had ever known. He was European and spoke five languages. He was attentive and thoughtful — always doing little things to impress her. His family was accomplished, creative and professional, and when she was with them she felt like she was part of something important. What she didn’t know about him seemed mysterious and attractive. Three years after they met, they married, and subtle signs began to emerge — so subtle that she recognizes them only in hindsight: his strange behavior when they were with a group of people, his criticisms and rude statements, his tendency to put her down in front of others, his withdrawal of intimacy. Most disturbing was his lack of empathy. When she was thrown from a horse and hospitalized, he showed no concern. When his friend died in an automobile accident, he seemed not to care. Over time, his verbal abuse grew. He screamed at Lisa, accused her of stealing his belongings and ruining his life. He broke glass objects and threw things at her. One night, in September of 2011, his verbal and emotional assaults peaked, and Lisa had finally had enough. She turned around and, with all the confidence she could muster, told him never to say those things to her again. She turned to walk away and never heard him coming. He grabbed her, threw her down, beat her with his fists, and repeatedly slammed her head against the wooden floor until she lost consciousness. When she awoke, still lying on the floor, she knew she had to flee. She mustered her strength and ran to a nearby gas station, where she collapsed. Police were called, and she was taken to the hospital, confused, frightened and injured. These days, Lisa feels like she can breathe freely again. But even in the silence she revels in, the fear is there. As she says, “I’m always looking over my shoulder.” Jordan had gotten to know Lisa and regards her as an extraordinary model for other women who have experienced domestic violence. She emphasizes that the Lisa Murray who was knocked unconscious on that awful September night and the Lisa Murray who is the consummate professional are the same person. As a testament to the strength of Lisa’s character, she immediately filed for divorce and took her abuser to criminal court, an excruciating ordeal during which she was forced to move three times and totaled her car. Warmels was convicted and subsequently spent a year in prison in Kentucky, followed by five months in a federal prison. Since his release, Warmels no longer resides in Kentucky but remains in the U.S. Lisa has reunited with her daughter, Jeren, who now has two children of her own. They love horses. Lisa and Pete with grandchildren Madison and Alexis. After discovering a lack of resources for battered women in Kentucky, Lisa has gone public with her case, appearing on the radio and becoming a member of the Kentucky Survivors Council. “It's a platform that I've stood strong about,” she said. “I prefer to see myself as a survivor and not a victim.” She gives enormous credit to Greenhouse17, an intimate partner abuse victims advocacy organization, for helping her through those terrible times. She is grateful to colleagues at Alltech, including the Lyons family and many of the company’s top executives, for their patience and unwavering support as she navigated troubled waters. And always there for her has been Pete and his barn companion, Jiltsjke, a big Friesian mare. “Those two horses are what saw me through that very traumatic, difficult time in my life,” she said. “Every day I could go out to the barn and it was just this smile. He’s silly and goofy. Anybody who’s around him will say, ‘Oh my gosh, you should see what he just did.’ He interacts with people.” Jiltsjke has since been sold, but Lisa says that Pete “is the one horse that I’ve had in my life that was never for sale. I’ve been offered a lot for Pete, but I will never let him go.” The brave woman and the misunderstood horse Pete found happiness by prevailing over a stereotype to reveal his truth: “I’m not a walker, I’m a jumper!” Repeat the Beat, or Pete as Lisa calls him. Photo Credit: Heidi Rockhold Lisa Murray has found her own truth in the discovery that as bad as things can get, “there is nothing I can’t do. Nothing I can’t achieve.” “I have a lot of strong, independent women friends, and those horses bring so much to us,” she said. “There were several times when I could’ve shipped Pete off for awhile and said ‘Hey, take care of him, I’m going through something.’ But if I were to sell Pete, I’d be selling my soul. I’m not going to compromise that.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/survivor-and-her-horse","title":"\n\n                    The survivor and her horse\n                    ","date":"July 28, 2017","contentLength":2507}},{"pageContent":"Peer into the abode of today’s modern millennial couple, and there’s something striking: the baby bassinet is missing and in its place is a perfectly plush dog bed. Millennials, as the largest consumer group, are the ultimate game-changers for pet food companies and product retailers. Millennial family portraits: Pet parents and the pooch The modern millennial family is being formed with pets instead of, or well before, the much later addition of children. As such, for pet companies and retailers, the ubiquitous “millennial mom” being chased by most major mainstream brands today is instead the powerful pet parent. These pet parents are more than willing to reach deep into their bank accounts for their beloved beasts. But they also possess similar characteristics to the traditional millennial mom: a demand for convenience, transparency and sustainability in the products they purchase. New to the pet-purchasing scene: Socially conscious spenders Now that millennials have reached the point in their lives to be engaged consumers with expendable incomes, big brands’ boardrooms are paying heed to the group’s demands and desires. While there is much negative stereotyping about the generation, millennials have matured into a group of socially aware consumers. With this comes a demand that the brands that they purchase are transparent about every aspect of their business, from the types and sources of their ingredients to the manufacturing processes and even sustainability initiatives in place at the corporate level. Small brands are in the spotlight The distrust that millennials have for large corporations has led to an embracing of smaller brands with a real message that feels personal to them. This is particularly evident in regard to ingredient sourcing and sustainability initiatives. Small brands have made a name for themselves by displaying their quality ingredients with transparency. Similarly, brands that tout the sustainability of their foods’ ingredients receive high marks from this generation. In the past, many of these smaller brands were ignored by the big players in the industry, but now those brands are prime targets for acquisition. Recognizing what these small players are doing right but realizing the inherent challenge for a large firm to morph into this new image is the precise reason behind these purchases. But a strong story with healthy, wholesome ingredients is not enough for millennials. Convenience is critical. Special delivery for Fido The online market for pet products has exploded recently. PetSmart purchased chewy.com in the largest e-commerce acquisition to date in order to rev up its lagging presence in the online space. Amazon Prime has set the expectation, and now today’s busy consumer can’t understand not having the option of fast, free delivery to their door. Brands without a value proposition for online convenience will be left behind. Four-legged social media stars Finally, companies must learn to embrace the new normal of pets as children. Social media is where we see the strongest evidence of the role that pets play in people’s lives. Pets themselves are commanding their own online “pack” of followers on Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat. The Huffington Post even published an article in March 2017 listing the best dogs to follow on Instagram. Obviously, the dogs are not posting, but their “parents” are, and these adorable pets and their antics are winning quick acclaim with generations that have grown up with cruising cat videos on YouTube. Just as grain-free sparked a revolution in the pet food industry, now millennials are fanning the flames of a new normal.

R. Martin’s bestselling books, set in a harsh world, its characters struggling as they face hard truths, might be a fitting metaphor for what is happening in the kingdom of the honey bee. But this is no game. The European honey bee, Apis mellifera, is the most economically valuable pollinator of agricultural crops worldwide. Bee pollination is responsible for more than $15 billion in added crop value in the United States. Especially dependent on bees are specialty crops such as almonds and other nuts, berries, fruits and vegetables. And there is the product of the bees themselves: honey. “Sadly, when all of this started to happen back around 2005–2006 with the bees just disappearing from their hives, nobody knew what to call it, so the media latched onto something called CCD, or colony collapse disorder, and that’s just a misnomer,” said Michele Colopy, program director at the Pollinator Stewardship Council in Akron, Ohio. “It is not explaining the issue well enough, and we would like the media to stop using it.” In fairness to the media, the term originated in the mid-2000s with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), where scientists were scrambling for an explanation. But the origins of the term hardly matters. Beekeepers had awakened to a nightmare of sickened, even vacant, hives. Think of their anxiety this way, suggested Colopy: “Honey bees are a beekeeper’s livestock, and they suffer under the same health stresses as any four-legged livestock that doesn’t have wings.” What happened? As Colopy stressed, in recent years, it has become clear that no single factor is responsible. According to the USDA, research is beginning to strongly suggest that CCD “may be a syndrome caused by many different factors, working in combination or synergistically.” As in the mythical “Game of Thrones,” the very real forces arrayed against the kingdom of the honey bee, the hive, have converged to lay siege in many guises and from many directions. Some likely candidates have recently been identified. There remains speculation about additional culprits. What we know about “colony collapse disorder” According to the USDA, researchers have documented elevated pathogen levels, and a wide array of pesticides have been present in the wax and pollen in both CCD-affected and non-affected apiaries, with none linked definitively to CCD. Pesticides “The wax (inside the hive) holds onto pesticides,” said Colopy. “It is a sponge. So, when a pesticide is brought into the hive on pollen or nectar or on the bodies of the bees, the toxin in the pesticide stays active for a longer time because it’s in the dark — most pesticides break down in sunlight. “But it’s not that we can suddenly open the hive to sunlight to change this, because the wax still holds onto the toxin and protects it,” she continued. “The toxin leaches through the wax.” Beginning in 2015, beekeepers began to report more bee deaths in late summer than in winter. It was a troubling sign. Hives are expected to be stronger and healthier in warm weather and more stressed in the cold months. “What is happening at the end of summer is the full effect of the pesticides,” explained Colopy. “They build up across the summer, and the bees are eating these toxins. This slowly kills off the adult foragers. Then the whole organism of the hive is thrown off because different bees have different duties, based on their age. “If you suddenly have too many foragers dying and everybody gets shoved ahead in their duties, you start to throw off the life cycle of the hive,” she continued. “The queen’s reproduction ability declines; there aren’t enough bees to help raise the brood, so you begin to slowly lose the population, and this is where that so-called ‘colony collapse’ comes in.” Mites In addition to pesticides, infestations of mites have taken a toll. Varroa destructor, a parasitic mite, propagates within the brood cells of bees. The mites can do serious damage to their hosts' health, latching on and feeding on hemolymph, insects' rough equivalent to blood. Bees are left with open wounds, making them susceptible to infection. Adding insult to injury, noted Kentucky State apiarist Tammy Potter, is a finding that Varroa mites can introduce viruses — one, in particular — to honey bee colonies. “Lake Sinai virus, named for a lake in South Dakota, is fairly new,” she said. “It has characteristics that look remarkably similar to what we used to call colony collapse disorder. “Forty-six percent of our (Kentucky) apiaries have high Varroa mite counts,” continued Potter, referencing the most recent USDA Honey Bee Health Survey. “There was only one from this particular year that did not have a virus present. The other 23 did.” Researchers and the USDA have urged a change in management strategy, including more frequent sampling. “Given the biology of the Varroa mite, the best management practice is to sample your bees for mites four times a year,” said Potter. In 2015, the EPA approved the use of oxalic acid (OA) as a Varroa mite treatment. Various studies have shown OA to be effective in a variety of climatic conditions with an efficacy as high as 97 percent in a broodless period. But it’s far too soon to breathe easy. Researchers at Purdue University have discovered that a sister species of the Varroa destructor mite is “shifting from feeding and reproducing on Asian honey bees, their preferred host, to European honey bees, the primary species used for crop pollination and honey production worldwide.” While Varroa Jacobsoni mites have not been found outside of Papua New Guinea, Purdue researcher Gladys Andino said vigilance is needed to protect European honey bees worldwide from further risk. \"This could represent a real threat,” said Andino. “If this mite gets out of control and spreads, we might have another situation like V. destructor.\" The Purdue researchers note with caution that “V. destructor made the same host leap at least 60 years ago, spreading rapidly to become the most important global health threat to European honey bees.” The Honey Bee Health Coalition, an organization of beekeepers, researchers, government agencies, agribusinesses, growers, conservation groups, manufacturers and consumer brands, is holding its first Mite-A-Thon in September. The event is “a national effort to collect mite infestation data and to visualize Varroa infestations in honey bee colonies across North America within a one-week window.” The Varroa monitoring data will be uploaded to www.mitecheck.com. Continuing research also focuses on additional possible CCD factors, such as the synergistic effects of the Nosema fungus and pesticides, and of pesticides and other pathogens. Monocultures Even before CCD came along, one of the biggest challenges for native wild bees has been the agricultural specialization that has produced huge fields of just one crop: the monoculture. The almond groves of California, for example, are a sea of blossoms in February. \"But for the rest of the year, there's nothing blooming,\" Claire Kremen, a conservation biologist at the University of California, Berkeley told NPR. \"In fact, in places where we have very large monocultures of almond, we don't find any native bees anymore.\" So honey bees must be trucked in from all over the country. And the industry's migratory characteristic may also contribute to the colony collapse problem. “If you start in South Dakota and you take your bees to California, where there are also honey bees from Indiana, Kentucky and Texas, that virus can be spread,” said Potter. Time is money, and this travel leaves little time to sample for mites, which can be a lengthy process. However, necessity has inspired invention, said Potter. “There is a new tool on the market to help beekeepers quickly sample their bees,” she said. “I think you will begin to see a significant decrease in hive mortality.” The Varro Easy Check tool uses an alcohol solution to remove mites from up to 300 bees at a time. Forage land development Working in combination with the impact of monocultures is the development of countryside and forests. Much pollinator habitat has been lost to urban and suburban development as well as surface mining. “Many pollinators are adversely affected when large, intact tracts of habitat are broken up into smaller, isolated patches by road construction, development or agriculture,” observed a joint study by the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation at the American Museum of Natural History and the Greenbelt Native Plant Center. “These habitat fragments may not be large enough to meet all pollinator needs by themselves.” Honey bees are left without the diverse sources of nectar and pollen they need to thrive when confronted with multiple factors known to affect their survival, growth and reproduction, the study concluded. How can we help the bees? What can be done to improve survival prospects for these industrious, socially sophisticated creatures and the human agriculture that depends on them? A survey of its beekeeper members by the Honey Bee Health Coalition found a demand for companies to offer supplemental pollen patties that address “specific regional, seasonal, and/or life cycle challenges and objectives.” They identified two primary drivers for beekeepers to feed protein supplements: “to stimulate colonies to produce more brood at certain times of year; and to offer nourishment when natural pollen flow is lacking.” Initial trials of the Alltech supplement Bee Pollen-Ate® suggest a promising response. “We’re increasing brood during low pollen levels,” said Kyle McKinney, Alltech’s crop science manager in Costa Rica. “It means the whole hive is active and healthy. When the queen lays the brood, the worker bees come in and start feeding the brood and building up the comb to protect the brood. We know with certainty that what we’ve seen in Costa Rica, during low pollen season, supplementing with Bee Pollen-Ate, we have a healthier and more active hive.” Acting as something of a worksite food truck, the quarter-inch-thick patty is placed atop the comb where the bees are working. “They come up and they feed on the patty and go back to work,” explained McKinney. There are numerous feed supplements on the market, and many beekeepers make their own “patty” of supplements. “I see about a 50-50 split between people who want to make their own patty using their own recipe versus people who want to buy a finished patty,” noted McKinney. “But even those who make their own are using our Bee Pollen-Ate as the protein supplement.” McKinney’s research partner, Tyler Bramble, general manager of Alltech ruminant nutrition in Visalia, California, said it appears that many commercial companies making pollen substitute products are in a race to see who can pack the most protein into a bee supplement patty. “I’m not convinced that more is always better,” he said. “I think you really need to look at the form and the digestibility. We see in livestock animals deleterious effects as protein levels become ridiculous. It costs the animal energy to process and get rid of all that extra protein.” The distinction between the Alltech product and others, Bramble noted, is the particular expertise behind its development. “With Alltech’s core competencies being animal nutrition and yeast fermentation, we understand all the different parts of a yeast cell,” he said. “That’s our business. We fractionate the yeast cell, and, because of our knowledge of the yeast cell and its various components, we are able to pull out protein, carbohydrate and nucleotide-rich portions of the cell. That enables us to make a designer pollen substitute.” With McKinney in Costa Rica, where it is now winter, and Bramble in California, where summer is in full force, the two are teaming up to carry out continuous trials of Bee Pollen-Ate. Their findings are anticipated by spring of 2018. A “what if” to ponder But what if all of our best efforts fail to restore the honey bee population to levels required for crop pollination? One possibility makes the long, deadly winter of “Game of Thrones” seem springlike by comparison. There is the prospect that in the not-too-distant future, farmers might not have to rely on declining bee populations. For example, researchers at Tokushima University in Japan have used the CRISPR gene-editing technique to produce seedless tomatoes, which do not require pollination at all.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/game-drones","title":"\n\n                    Game of drones\n                    ","date":"August 11, 2017","contentLength":2092}},{"pageContent":"How do you prefer your salmon: wild-caught or farm-raised? When that question came up in dinner conversations 20 years ago, the answer likely would have revealed skepticism about farmed fish. In those days, the industry was new. Salmon farms were being accused of polluting the oceans. Some were found to be harboring and incubating disease, turning a blind eye to infected escapees, and wiping out forage fish, up to 7 pounds of which once went into each pound of farmed Atlantic salmon. But those negatives did nothing to dampen a growing world population’s appetite for fish. Seventeen percent of the protein people eat already comes from the sea, and demand is set to rise by 40 percent by 2050, according to the Norwegian Seafood Council. “The consumption of salmon has tripled over the past 15 years,” said Keith Filer, research coordinator for aquaculture at Alltech. “The increased consumption would not be possible by relying on wild-caught salmon. Farmed-raised salmon is the only option for supplying the increase in demand.” Still, it’s not unusual to encounter lingering debate and a host of misperceptions over wild-caught versus farmed salmon. And in this era of the smart device with details about our foods accessible at our fingertips, there has been commensurate pressure from consumer and wildlife advocates to reform aquaculture. “Salmon farmers did a funny thing,” wrote The Washington Post contributor Tamar Haspel. “They listened. The survival of the industry depended on farmers cleaning up their act, and so that’s what they started to do.” That has included an effort to boost consumer confidence and demonstrate a commitment to the environment through independent, third-party certification. “The best-regarded of the certification programs will require record keeping, disclosure and transparency so the public can know that the fish they choose has been secured with care,” said Contessa Kellogg-Winters, communications director at the Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC). The ASC has developed certification based on industry standards that address the adverse impacts associated with aquaculture. Thousands of NGOs, scientists, academics, farmers and industry experts contributed to the process. According to Kellogg-Winters, the ASC standards: Regulate where farms can be sited to protect vulnerable nature areas. Help protect the surrounding ecosystems and biodiversity. Preserve the quality of the water. Mandate strict criteria for resources use. Regulate feed practices and mandate that farms use more sustainable feed. Require best practices that combat the spread of illness and parasites between farmed fish and wild fish. Proactively prevent fish escapes. Reduce the use of pesticides and chemicals. Set stringent controls for the use of antibiotics. These standards not only raise the bar on the quality of production, but also serve to combat misperceptions about farmed salmon. Here are some of the more persistent among them: Myth: Farmed salmon are raised with growth hormones and antibiotics “An important misperception that I have come across is the use of growth hormones and antibiotics in feeds for farmed salmon,” said Gijs Rutjes, technical sales support manager at the fish feed producer Alltech Coppens. “This is not true for the growth hormones. Antibiotics are only used as a last resort in salmon farming to cure a potentially dangerous bacterial disease but never to prevent diseases or to get performance benefit. Just like we would go to the doctor when we are seriously ill.” Myth: Farmed fish are raised in dirty conditions and generate pollution Concerns that fish are farmed in dirty water and crowded conditions linger. The industry, however, has developed a better understanding of regional capacity — the total number of farmed fish an area can support, according to the Monterey Bay Aquarium’s Seafood Watch. The result has been a decline in pollution as farms allow areas to recover before fish are replaced there. Fish farmers “choose suitable sites for cage farming where the conditions and water quality are optimal,” said Rutjes. “They use feeds that keep the fish healthy and that ensure good growth. Nets are cleaned regularly to make sure sufficient water flow is there and to keep oxygen levels optimal. The salmon are kept at rather low densities, and they have spacious net cages that provide ample possibilities for natural behavior.” Marine Harvest's salmon net cages in Norway. For example, to prevent overcrowding, Norwegian law requires that salmon make up less than 2.5 percent of the pen’s volume. Each pen is made up of 97.5 percent water to allow for maximum comfort and a healthy growth cycle. Salmon farms, he said, have been moving production to land-based recirculation aquaculture systems (RAS). These closed systems have no escapees, and the feces are collected and removed. Salmon raised indoors at Marine Harvest in Norway. Rutjes added that it’s in the fish farmer’s best interests to maintain a clean operation. “A salmon farmer cares about his fish and knows the better he looks after them, the better the growth and flesh quality,” he explained. Myth: Feed conversion rates are high and inefficient for farmed fish Among lingering misconceptions is that a feed conversion rate of as much as 7 pounds of forage fish is needed to grow 1 pound of farmed salmon. “The salmon industry has worked for many years to reduce the use of marine products in diets,” said Filer. “The feed conversion ratio for the industry has been reduced to as little as 1.6 to 1. The marine species that are used are not ones that are consumed by humans, and the major fish meal producers are much better at restricting the amount of fish harvested on a yearly basis.” Alltech Coppens has yielded several new algae-based products that help reduce dependence on forage fish. These include the sustainable fish oil replacer ForPlus, an algae-derived fish oil substitute containing very high levels of DHA, which has been found to help reduce risk factors for heart diseases like high cholesterol and high blood pressure. Myth: Farmed salmon are not an environmentally friendly choice According to Kellogg-Winters, a side-by-side comparison of the resources and emissions it takes to produce salmon, chicken, pork, beef and lamb has shown salmon to be the most environmentally friendly of the group. “Salmon convert more of what they are fed into consumable protein for the end user and require fewer resources for their feed,” she explained. “Pound for pound, salmon farming produces less waste — and requires fewer raw materials — to produce more of the food our growing global population needs.” Myth: Farmed salmon’s pink hue is the result of artificial injections A Lerøy Seafood Group employee fillets farmed salmon raised in Norway. Another concern voiced by consumers is the notion that farmed salmon get their pink color from artificial injections. Kiara Vallier, a writer for the submersible vehicle manufacturer Deep Trekker, notes, “Both wild and farmed salmon get their pink color from a carotenoid antioxidant in their diet called astaxanthin, which is traditionally produced by algae that wild salmon consume. Generally, farmed salmon are fed a diet that contains a chemically synthesized astaxanthin, so they get their color from the same antioxidant as their wild counterparts.” Myth: Wild salmon tastes better than farmed salmon Meanwhile, at the dinner table, how does wild-caught salmon differ in taste and texture from the farmed variety? Which is best? To find out, The Washington Post assembled a panel of noted Washington seafood chefs and a seafood wholesaler for a blind taste test. They included Scott Drewno, executive chef of The Source by Wolfgang Puck; chef-restaurateur Kaz Okochi (Kaz Sushi Bistro, Masa 14); chef-restaurateur Bob Kinkead (Ancora); Bonnie S. Benwick, Tim Carman and Jane Touzalin of The Washington Post; and John Rorapaugh, director of sustainable initiatives at ProFish. The fish, in order of panel preference (rated 1–10, with 10 being the highest score): 1. Costco farmed Atlantic, frozen in 4 percent salt solution, from Norway; $6 per pound (7.6 out of 10) 2. Trader Joe’s farmed Atlantic, from Norway; $10.99 per pound (6.4) 3. Loch Duart farmed Atlantic, from Scotland; $15 to $18 per pound (6.1) 4. Verlasso farmed Atlantic, from Chile; $12 to $15 per pound (6) 5. Whole Foods farmed Atlantic salmon, from Scotland; $14.99 per pound (5.6) 6. ProFish wild king (netted), from Willapa Bay, Washington; $16 to $20 per pound (5.3) 7. AquaChile farmed Atlantic, from Chile; $12 to $15 per pound (4.9) 8. ProFish wild coho (trolled), from Alaska; $16 to $20 per pound (4.4) 9. ProFish wild king (trolled), from Willapa Bay, Washington; $16 to $20 per pound (4) 10. Costco wild coho, from Alaska; $10.99 per pound (3.9) Much has changed, and for the better, since the early days of salmon farming. “We have certainly seen improvements in the performance of the aquaculture sector over the years, and we expect even more to come as a greater number of farms understand the imperative of operating with great care for the environment and those who work on their farms,” noted Kellogg-Winters. “The farms that voluntarily commit to the ASC have to operate in a transparent manner: they must keep records, work well with the community and improve their environmental performance to meet the standard.” You can stay current on salmon and other seafood by checking FishWatch, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website. The site profiles six salmon species: chum, coho, chinook, sockeye, pink and Atlantic (both wild and farmed). Want to try your hand at whipping up a great salmon dinner?

An aquaculture pond is a diverse habitat populated by countless species that interact with each other to achieve a unique balance, known as symbiosis. A holistic approach to maintaining aquatic symbiosis The existing variables in aquaculture are diverse and interrelated. Pathological events are an imbalance of the aquaculture universe; therefore, any techniques and methodologies that incorporate key elements (e.g., water quality, soil, nutrition, biosecurity) must be positive and sustainable over time. Treating these variables separately will not generate permanent results. The aim should be to seek alternative options, such as integrating them into a more holistic concept. A great example is technology that combines prebiotic concepts with probiotics, which work together to create a symbiotic environment. Eventually, this alternative approach stimulates beneficial microorganisms (e.g., phytoplankton, zooplankton, bacteria, yeast), which stabilize aquaculture ponds and lower the risk of disease. Becoming part of the symbiosis Through management programs focused on health, biosecurity, nutrition and immune support, we have integrated ourselves into this symbiosis, effectively becoming the missing link in aquaculture. For example, in Ecuador, we have been working with industry partners to develop a symbiotic environment for shrimp through the production of bokashi. Bokashi consists of soy cake, a source of soluble and insoluble fibers. Its protein is also considered a functional food source. Soy nutrients are released when combined with enzymes such as Allzyme® SSF and Allzyme® Vegpro, in addition to Lacto-Sacc®, which provides high-performance probiotics. An interesting fact is that the probiotics in Lacto-Sacc, such as Latobacillus acidophilus and Enterococcus faecium, contribute metabolites (natural organic acids), which acidify the digestive tract. Additionally, enriching bokashi with Bio-Mos® and organic trace minerals like Sel-Plex® and Bioplex® may result in optimal farming conditions and significant cost savings.

Once harvest is complete, it is the perfect time to take stock of the previous growing season and look ahead to what the next year will bring. In particular, we have four winter planning suggestions for growers to maximize the potential of their operation in the coming seasons. Soil testing: Post-harvest is an important time to get your soil testing done. The testing will create a baseline for spring and help you plan for nutrient applications. It can also allow for more economical alternatives to nutrient applications that are usually administered in the spring. For example, phosphorus and potassium tend to be more economical during the offseason. “Historically, the least expensive time to buy phosphorus and potassium is late in the year,” said Chuck McKenna, Alltech Crop Science sales manager. “As soon as facilities start filling up with those ingredients, the price goes up.” McKenna also noted that applying these nutrients in late autumn and winter frees up the grower to potentially only apply nitrogen, if needed, in the spring. Cover cropping: The use of cover crops in autumn and winter allows for increased aeration and water-holding capability in the soil. A growing crop will also help support microbes in the soil and allow them to break down organic matter well into the winter and spring. Depending on the blend of cover the grower chooses, it can also target compaction and weed control issues. Weed control: An effective weed control program will allow you to plant earlier, as the soils will tend to warm up faster if they are not affected by a weed problem. If there is a problem with breakthrough weeds or weeds that haven’t been seen before, this is a good time to plan for how to manage these challenges. Review the information from your yield monitor: Are you finding that there are trouble spots that you are not able to see? Is there an issue with sudden death syndrome that was not noticeable while the crop was growing? Are there areas that are more susceptible to weeds, therefore decreasing yield? Have insects caused a problem with your yields? A bird’s-eye view from the yield monitor, paired with the field record, will give you a broader image of what is going on in the field. In order to make the most of the time between harvest and planting, gather all the information from the previous year and create a map for the upcoming year, including financial aspects such as ROI and whether or not you plan to use more acres for a particular crop. Sit down with your agronomist and talk about your issues and your plan now, because winter is coming but spring is just around the corner.

With an FCR of 6.4:1, cattle are sometimes compared to chickens for the efficiency of their 2.1:1 FCR. Some argue that comparing the FCRs of chickens to cows is like comparing apples to oranges, and their points are fair. However, even when comparing the efficiencies of dairy cattle to beef cattle, beef cattle still come up short. If beef cattle were metabolically efficient like dairy cows, then by extrapolation, beef cattle would reach a weight of about 2 tons by two years of age. This is clearly unreasonable. Inefficiencies in industries contribute to profit losses, but is it even possible for the beef industry to become more efficient? Professor Maurice Boland, European research director for Alltech, believes that beef cattle have the potential to make FCR improvements. The right process just needs to be implemented with the help of the right tools. He explained his reasoning, describing the tools and processes at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference 2017. Moo-ving toward the goal of beef cattle efficiency In order to make cattle more efficient, there needs to be fewer days on feed and less feed fed per day, while still reaching the desired carcass weights. Genomics seems to be the best tool for achieving these goals; however, there is still a lot of work that needs to be done on genomics in beef cattle. “While genomics has made a significant improvement in dairy herds, it’s going to be easier said than done to achieve the same kind of input in beef herds because of that animal-to-animal variation,” said Boland. Bullseye: Finding the reproductive targets While genomics is improving, recent work is contributing to a better understanding of how to improve the reproduction process. The following are some of the reproductive targets for beef cattle gathered from a recent publication1 by Michael G. Diskin and David A. Kenny of the Animal and Bioscience Research Department at the Teagasc Animal and Grassland Research and Innovation Centre. These reproductive targets suggest that, in order to achieve optimum production: Calving intervals should be at or below 365 days. Less than 5 percent of cows should be culled as barren. The age at first calving should be 24 months. There should be a replacement rate of 16 to 18 percent. To determine if the environment in utero had significant effects on post-natal health, Alexander Evans, the dean of agriculture and head of the School of Agriculture and Food Science at University College Dublin, examined in a separate study2 the effects that nutrition had on the ovarian follicles in fetal development. By 150 days, most heifer calves will have all of the follicles that they are ever going to have. Evans altered the nutrition of two groups of cows that were to be inseminated and continued the nutritional plan throughout a portion of the pregnancy. The resulting calves did not differ in weight at birth nor any measure of size, but the control group, with the new nutrition plan, had a significantly higher peak ovarian follicle number than those coming from cows that had their energy intake restricted during the first 110 days of preganancy. A higher follicle number means that the reproductive targets established by Diskin and Kenny are more achievable. Beefing up Another study conducted by Giuliana Miguel-Pacheco3, honorary research associate for the National Autonomous University of Mexico, showed that crude protein in the second trimester significantly increased the body weight in the calves. While birthweights were only slightly higher, the crude protein increased calf growth rate during the first six months. Boland is optimistic about the opportunities that prenatal nutritional programming could present for improved cattle FCR, “I think there are opportunities there that we haven’t all engaged with in relation to what is happening in the pregnancy period,” he said. “The mechanismns to take advantage of that opportunity are there.” Cash cows Although improved beef cattle efficiency has often seemed fraught with challenges, recent studies are indicating the promise of prenatal nutritional programming. The more efficient cattle become, the more profit producers will make. Continued research, especially research focusing on in uteronutrition, holds the potential to make every cow a cash cow.

It isn’t genetic engineering or modification, but rather a way of measuring changes in the activity of genes that result from changes in an animal’s diet. This field of research opens many doors that were previously closed in classic animal nutrition and allows us to better understand how “you are what you eat,” or rather, your chickens are what you feed them. What is nutrigenomics? Before we can talk about nutrigenomics, let’s do a quick review of molecular biology. Each animal has what’s called a genome that contains all of the genetic material, or DNA, of an animal and provides the basic blueprint for life. These carefully drawn out plans provide the blueprint for that animal’s life. However, outside influences, such as nutrition, can have a strong impact on the expression of this genetic information, or essentially how that blueprint is read. Over the last decade, genomes have begun to be sequenced. This means that we know the approximate makeup of an animal’s entire genome. Identifying the genome sequences opened the door for cutting-edge research approaches to understand the molecular mechanisms behind everyday life. Even more importantly, we can now use genomic technologies to understand how each of the genes in that genomic sequence responds to outside influences and how this relates to the health and disease of an animal. The genomic sequence is very stable, so changes in function and activity come from up-regulating (“turning on”) or down-regulating (“turning off”) individual genes to produce (or decrease) products called transcripts in response to a stimulus like nutrition. These transcripts code for the proteins that make up structures and functions in the cells, so the result is that changes occur in physiological processes like energy production or immune response. Nutrigenomics is the field of research we use to study these changes in gene activities that occur because of changes in the animal’s diet. This information can help us better understand how nutrition influences animal health and production by giving us insights into what is going on within the cell in response to changes in the diet. We can measure the response in animal tissue using a technology called DNA microarrays. These tools are the basis of nutrigenomics studies and allow researchers to profile the activity of all the genes on a genome at once. The information gathered from nutrigenomics studies can provide us with a better understanding of nutrition by giving us clues to how nutrients work, why different forms of nutrients have different effects and how such nutrients can be optimized for health and production. How can we use nutrigenomics to further poultry nutrition? Current research can paint us a picture of how nutrigenomics is being applied to poultry nutrition. For example, recent work at Alltech has helped decipher why different forms of nutrients in the diet, such as Bioplex® organic minerals versus inorganic forms of minerals, can have very different effects on animal health. Before nutrigenomics, analyses like animal growth and tissue nutrient content gave us only part of the picture. But now, we can understand why changes occur. Mineral matters We know that Bioplex minerals support increased tissue levels. Through nutrigenomics, we identified changes in important transport proteins in the intestine that lead to increased mineral uptake into tissues when Bioplex zinc is used in poultry diets. In a similar fashion, we used nutrigenomics to understand why Sel-Plex® has a greater effect on reproduction than inorganic selenium. Traditional poultry nutrition studies were only able to reach the conclusion that it was due to selenium’s role in antioxidant defenses. However, nutrigenomics data confirmed this and, more importantly, indicated that selenium in the form of Sel-Plex could alter genes involved in energy production and reproductive signaling in the oviduct. In males, it made a clear impact on genes involved in tissue structure and function. Early birds Another area in which nutrigenomics is leading to a new understanding of the importance of nutrition is nutritional programming. This concept is the idea that nutrition, especially early in life, can have lasting imprints on an animal’s entire life. By understanding the gene expression patterns that are targeted by early life nutrition, we can begin to determine how this programming occurs and use it to our advantage in poultry production. For example, nutrigenomics studies have shown that changing the trace mineral content in the post-hatch diet can have long-term effects on genes in the gastrointestinal tract that are important for nutrient transport and for intestinal tissue structure. These genes remain changed in the adult bird weeks after the post-hatch period. In the future, the information that nutrigenomics provides us could change the way we feed birds and make poultry nutrition a more precise field. Molecular findings can add to our understanding of how nutrition influences animal production and health and how we can use nutrition to get the best out of our animals. Nutrigenomics provides a way to know preciously what nutrients, timing of nutrients or combinations of nutrients are optimal. Through this information, we can not only streamline nutrition, but improve performance, efficiency and health.

To listen to our entire conversation with Jim, click on the player. Jim, you spoke earlier today about brands finding their north star, and you also were an author of a book called Grow. Is growth always good for a company? We have seen companies recently that have actually narrowed their focus a little bit because they felt like they were growing too much and in too many different directions. I think a growth mindset is good, although option B is not good. Companies that are cutting costs and selling businesses may be doing that for a reason, but I don’t know how you build a culture of innovation, change and creativity if you don’t have a growth mindset. How do you attract talent if they don’t feel like they can grow their careers or opportunities? I’m studying a lot of old and young companies now for a new book, and I look at companies like General Electric (GE), IBM and Ford. They are asking very different questions and expanding their view of their business, and I think they are creating new opportunities and attracting different kinds of talent. If you look at even GE’s corporate ads now, they are about the new kind of company they are: a digital company. They are seeking to recruit different kinds of people; they are reinforcing their culture in those ads. This is a company that has shed businesses and has restructured their business but is now thinking growth. In their case, maybe it’s even keeping to the north star that you talked about, the innovation, and their focus now on innovation is taking on a digital component. Yes — now they want to make the world work better by linking machines with better information. That’s their goal; they really want to transform the industry by bringing a digital mind and digital capability to the industrial world. It’s a beautiful thing. In this landscape, how do you feel the role of the CMO is changing? Well, the chief marketing officer today is a more important role in more companies. You can see there are more companies with CMOs, and there has been some analysis of companies that are growing faster than others. They typically have marketing as a stronger capability, and you’re seeing longer-tenured CMOs in that position. Leadership is still very important. The way to motivate people, attract talent, bring out the best in people and set a direction for the company is still very important. They have to be very comfortable with data analytics as well as creativity. They have to have both sides of their brain developed, and they have to be building an organization for the future that has those capabilities. If they are relying on what they were good at when they were younger, it’s not enough. To me, great CMOs are curious and humble, creating a culture of curiosity, collective purpose and collaboration. CMOs today have to build the right capabilities but, actually more important, the right culture. That leads into another question: You talk about ideals-driven companies. Is that idea built around transparency, and do you feel like companies are really moving to transparency, or is it just a marketing message? No, I think they are moving to more transparency. Look at what’s happening in the beverage and food industry. Companies are being more proactive, more transparent. They are doing things they are not forced to do, but they realize consumers care and people have 24-hour access to any information they want. It’s an important part of being a brand today, so to me transparency is part of an ideals-driven philosophy. I think great brands and great business have a great ideal and have a reason to be; they have something that everyone understands. They need the behaviors to support that. If you’re Ford and want to re-invent transportation to get people from here to there in a more efficient and environmentally safe way, then your behaviors better be a part of that and support that. I think it’s part of being an ideals-driven company. When we talk about growth, I think something that’s important for us as an international company is the idea of balancing centralization and consistency with localization in any market. Certainly that is something that you experienced with Procter & Gamble (P&G). What advice would you have for companies that are growing and becoming more international to balance centralization and localization? I think the best brands have one purpose or one idea. They have a framework of what it means to their customers and employees, but then they allow the employees to have some freedom in that framework. Alltech is one brand, so you want it to share a common purpose, have common characteristics, common behaviors and want people to share the same values about the brand. It has to be centralized and have an Alltech brand manager or franchise manager. Then if you’re in Russia, Italy or China, you want to give your local team the ability to seize opportunities to delight customers. They still have to be the values of Alltech and work toward the purpose of Alltech. It’s a very delicate thing, but companies tend to go more decentralized. I think the trend is that you need more central leadership of the brand but then a very strong relationship with your counties. That’s what great brands do. Lastly, what companies are on Jim Stengel’s watch list as far as doing marketing right, growth right and ideals-driven organization right? Well, the good news is that there are a lot of them and a lot of them that are trying to move in the right direction. A brand that I don’t work with now but I know some people at and I just admire greatly is LEGO. Think about them: They have a very strong ideal and creativity and play. They are making content like crazy — movies, documentaries — endlessly innovative. Engagement scores are off the chart and they are still not satisfied with it. They enable their people to be free and creative, but they operate in a framework. They have a central leadership of LEGO, but the countries are able to capitalize on opportunities. Their profitability is growing. If you look at them versus their competition, it’s kind of night and day, so that’s one brand that I just think is doing so many good things. From a corporate perspective, I like what Unilever is doing — a competitor of P&G. They really embrace trying to make a big growth goal. The way they get there is by reducing their impact on the planet. I think that has galvanized people to attract talent. They are doing very innovative and creative things with their brands that are good for the planet. This is a very large company that is pulling this off, so I like what they are doing. I think GE is amazing to watch because their stock prices have begun to grow. Wall Street is beginning to reward what they are doing, and their culture is changing in a very deep way. They have strong leadership at the top from Beth Comstock. These are a few I admire, but the good news is I think we have a movement in the kinds of things we’re talking about. There are more and more companies that are raising the game. They are behaving better, setting bigger goals and trying to make a difference. No one is perfect and stumbles along the way, but I do think we’re on a good trend. I am excited to see what happens next year. Jim Stengel spoke at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference.

For the first time in history, the consumption of farmed fish has exceeded that of wild-caught fish, and by 2030, aquaculture is expected to account for two-thirds of the fish that humans consume. Aquaculture also includes the production of shellfish, crustaceans and seaweeds that provide both important sources of human nutrition and molecular components for the pharmaceutical industry. The increased demand for fish has put a strain on resources and sustainable practices among fisheries, requiring the innovative use of existing and new technologies. Fortunately, there is great potential to produce this protein source sustainably, particularly through the advent of technology. Like other agricultural industries, the technologies being introduced within aquaculture are the focus of interest from the farming community and its investors. According to AgFunder, aquaculture investment increased 271 percent in 2016 over the previous two years. The demand for fish is ever-increasing, particularly as its health benefits continue to gain acclaim with consumers, who, overall, are becoming more interested in the nutritional advantages of their food choices. While the production of fish as a primary protein source is considerably more efficient than other protein sources such as cattle or pork by as much as six and four times, respectively, on a feed conversion basis, much can still be done to improve production and efficiency in aquaculture. In a previous article, I identified eight technologies that possess the power to transform agriculture. I’d like to outline specifically how these eight technologies are having a profound impact on aquaculture. 1. Could 3D printing save lives? Believe it or not, you can print your own hydroponic system! That is, of course, if you have a 3D printer. While many people still do not have one for personal use, 3D printers are becoming more affordable, and it’s possible that home 3D printers could become as ubiquitous as coffee makers in the near future. 3Dponics is a company that offers downloadable instructions for printing hydroponic systems. Not only could this technology be used by the aquaculture industry to produce hybrid aquaponic systems, but it could potentially lead to personal at-home aquaculture gardens. Another example of 3D printing in aquaculture is a fish robot printed by MIT that almost perfectly mimics an actual fish’s motions and movements. Technology like this could allow for opportunities to further study and understand the natural environments of aqua-related species. A better understanding of fish in their natural environment could aid in improving welfare conditions and provide a more natural experience for fish used in production. This soft robotic fish was developed by MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. Photo Credit: M. Scott Brauer A very different aspect of 3D printing involves the production of seaweed. Aquaculture includes plant stocks raised in bodies of water, and within this space, algae hold particular promise for causing disruption and even saving lives. Algae have been used to create an environmentally friendly, inexpensive material in the form of a gel used to 3D print medical implant devices. If demand increases enough to drive the need for increased production, companies such as Australian-based Venus Shell Systems could reap the benefits. The production of human tissue and organs is also already on the agendaalgae could lead to the next generation of life-saving procedures. 2. Will robots farm our fish? While considered a sustainable alternative to wild fishing, farmed fish are not without their own sustainability concerns. Fish farms are often cramped conditions that can exacerbate issues such as diseases and parasites, leading to lower yields and higher production costs. A remarkable company that is using this technology to actively sort sick or harmed fish as well as those that are ready for processing is Cermaq. The future of fish farming could very well lie in giant, autonomous roaming robotic cages, called aquapods, such as the SeaStation by InnovaSea. While these impressive cages might seem costly when compared to other costs of aquaculture, the technology is likely to prove its efficiencies against stationary fish farms, particularly as demand for protein from fish sources increases. The Aquapod is a free-floating fish farm that can accommodate several hundred thousand fish. Image Credit: InnovaSea. If aquapods grow fish in the open ocean, what happens when repairs are needed? Norwegian company SINTEF is developing an underwater robot that will be able to examine and repair these nets, providing a safer and more cost-effective way to manage the operation. How will we then get these offshore fish to market? Rolls Royce believes robotic cargo ships will be used for more efficient, clean and cost-effective shipping, and this concept could potentially become a vehicle for transporting the fish raised offshore to commercial entities. In fact, Rolls Royce has already signed contracts to transport construction materials for offshore aqua farms, though these will most likely be facilitated through usual cargo methods initially. Other robotic opportunities in our oceans include SeaVax, which is working to create a large-scale, solar-powered robotic vacuum cleaner that could pick up around 150 tons of plastic from the ocean. OceanOne is a bimanual underwater humanoid that allows for safer underwater exploration. This innovation could potentially serve as a human avatar, allowing the operator to work underwater while staying onshore. Maritime Robotics and Deep Trekker both provide robotic or unmanned ocean monitoring devices to be used in exploration and aqua farming. 3. Drones dare to take on dangerous dives for data Similar in many ways to robots, drones also offer applications for aquaculture both above and below the water. Drones can be utilized for monitoring offshore fish farms, for example, and can take on any number of tasks that currently require specialized and expensive human intervention, such as inspecting underwater cages for damage or holes. Companies like Apium Swarm Robotics use drones en masse to survey the ocean and provide analysis through the use of sensor technology. Blueye Pioneer offers live video streaming of underwater exploration through the use of the Blueye app on a smartphone, tablet or with goggles. Companies like SeaDrone, Aquabotix, PowerRay and OpenROV are making affordable drones for underwater exploration of both a professional and personal nature. This PowerRay drone can even include a virtual reality headset that allows users to explore open water while staying dry. Image Credit: PowerRay website Drones are also able to collect information that can be used to create algorithms that further develop the technology or applications available in the production of aquaculture and offshore fish farms. Saildrone, for example, offers data collection, fish stock analysis and environmental tracking and could easily be applied to offshore aquaculture. This aquatic drone connects with a producer’s tablet, smartphone or computer and allows for information to be gathered and analyzed. 4. Sensors for smarter, more sustainable aquaculture Many of the drones and robots mentioned above use sensors to navigate underwater and collect data such as water pH, salinity, oxygen levels, turbidity and pollutants. From salmon to oysters, biosensors such as those created by Sense-T are helping to create efficiencies in the industry through the analysis of oxygen levels and water temperature; even heart rate and metabolism can be measured! Shrimp farms in India are using Sensorex to monitor dissolved oxygen levels and balance pH to create an ideal atmosphere for improved shrimp efficiencies and yields. One of the coolest technologies is that of eFishery, which uses sensors to detect the hunger level of the fish and feed them accordingly. It can be used in any size farm and can reduce feed costs by up to 21 percent. eFishery’s sensor technology can reduce feeding costs by up to 21 percent. Photo courtesy of eFishery. Real Tech uses sensors to monitor water quality and uses ultraviolet transmission to disinfect water of pathogens and clean aquaculture production facilities. Norwegian AKVA Group builds an entire cage with cameras, sensors, feeding and recirculation systems for use in open ocean or inland farming. Osmobot focuses exclusively on land-based aquaculture and allows for cloud management and mobile connectivity. YSI has an array of handheld sensing devices, automatic feeding technology and transportation tanks that maintain the fishes’ ideal environment. Other neat companies that offer entire monitoring systems include IPI Singapore, which offers real-time monitoring and connects for cloud-based analytics, and Pentair, which offers a complete suite of sensor-enabled aquaponic equipment for the small-time hobbyist all the way up to commercial production companies. 5. Artificial intelligence empowers aquaculture decision-making Collecting most of their information from sensors, many aquaculture technology companies are harnessing the power of artificial intelligence (AI) to improve decision-making. The Yield, an Australian company that provides technologies for all types of agriculture, uses its Sensing+Aqua technology to create predictive analytics for enhanced data-driven decision-making. Shoal’s robotic fishes work collectively using AI to locate sources of pollution underwater. Credit: SHOAL Consortium/handout A robotic fish known as Shoal uses AI, or swarm intelligence (SI), to detect pollution underwater. The robots are sent out as a group and must be able to navigate their environment, avoid obstacles, including those of other robotic fish, recharge themselves at charging stations and generally make decisions autonomously of humans. Even companies that are considered market leaders in simpler technologies such as camera and feeding systems, such as Steinvikare making strides to incorporate AI and system learning into their technology in order to remain competitive and accommodate customers’ rising expectations. According to The Economist, nearly 32 percent of wild-caught fish are procured unsustainably. The introduction of AI can greatly reduce overexploited fish species through camera and data collection systems that use AI to identify species and enable greater accountability of harvesting practices. The Seafood Innovation Cluster launched the AquaCloud platform, which aims to help managers, researchers and scientists gain new insights through its massive data collection and analysis. Particularly focused on sea lice management, the platform then uses AI to aid in the monitoring of infestations' development and spread within the environment, effectively promoting more effective area management systems for the control of pathogens. 6. Augmented reality (AR) adds a new dimension to dives The U.S. Navy developed this diver’s helmet that uses augmented reality. Photo courtesy of the U.S. Navy. There is great potential for the use of AR in the aquaculture industry. Already the U.S. Navy uses DAVD (Divers Augmented Vision Display), which superimposes high-resolution sonar imagery on a diver’s visual world. NASA has tested Microsoft’s HoloLens in a similar way. Comparable masks include Scubus S by Indiegogo, which has a camera, or Smart Swimming Goggles by Yanko Design, which even allows for calls between divers. The implications for this from an aquaculture industry standpoint are significant. Producers could use this technology to improve the efficiency of operations, analyze mortalities, health status and a variety of environmental parameters. One of the best ways to incorporate AR into the aquaculture industry is to use it for teaching and instructional purposes. The Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) designed an aquaculture simulator using virtual reality and AR, incorporating Oculus Rift’s technologies. The program has been designed to teach about fish welfare, disease prevention, escaping fish and dangerous working conditions. This last concept is of particular importance to students, as salmon farming is one of Norway’s principle industries. 7. Virtual reality (VR) is opening the eyes of the next generation to aquaculture Currently, the most practical applications for virtual reality are training and education. The opportunities for VR in the aquaculture industry are many, particularly for training and education. VR is being used by NTNU to pique the next generation’s interest in aquaculture. NTNU has developed an aquaculture simulator that uses VR to allow students to virtually visit a fish farm. It is quite clear how such developments could also be used for training purposes in the aquaculture industry. 8. Blockchain verifies sustainability, improves transparency from fishery to finished plate Blockchain is best known as a financially secure method of payment, which could greatly benefit the aquaculture industry. Due in part to the lifecycle of the fish and in part to the significant values involved in the transactions, the industry suffers from a poor reputation for payment contracts. Much like the concept of open ocean fishing, the interconnectivity of blockchain should elicit more sustainable practices in aquaculture. Blockchain is a digital record of transactions that is accessible publicly and is incorruptible by any one person. What it would mean for the aquaculture industry is the opportunity for transactions between suppliers and purchasers to occur immediately and safely. There would be no need for the exchange of physical monies, potentially saving the added expense of transaction and currency exchanges. Furthermore, information about individual harvests and production methods could be stored here and made accessible to other producers and consumers. Privacy is always a critical concern when discussing these matters, but the way blockchain is set up maintains privacy while enforcing transparency. Fish that is claimed as sustainably produced could, in fact, be verified as such. Connecting all of these disruptive technologies is the internet of things (IoT). It is this technological revolution of computing and communications that makes the robot capable of performing tasks as assigned by a remote user or that transfers information obtained through sensors to producers for analysis on smartphones, tablets or computers. For prime examples of IoT technology, look no further than Eruvaka Technologies or Cargo Zippers. The adaptation and adoption of these eight digital technologies are occurring at an ever-increasing rate in many industries. Aquaculture has been a relatively late adopter, and what we are seeing is only the tip of the iceberg. When considering that the industry is the fastest-growing sector in food production and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations anticipates that an additional 27 million tons of fish production will be needed just to maintain the present level of consumption in 2030, it should come as no surprise that additional ag-tech investments in aquaculture will be at record levels. The future of fish farming looks more sustainable, more traceable and more profitable.

With so much of the diet dependent on the nutrients a cow receives from forage, it is important to make sure the crop reaches its nutrient and energy potential. Nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, the major components of fertilizer, are essential for soil nutrient content and are controlled by pH. We test and fertilize for these nutrients regularly, and they are often the first place we look for a solution if a problem arises in crop health. However, critical elements — like calcium, magnesium, and sulfur — are often seen as secondary in importance in terms of soil content, and, in turn, plant health. For example, with current industry practices, recent findings show that sulfur deficiency of 10 to 20 pounds per acre is common in much of the United States. Of these elements, sulfur in particular might be the missing piece in your forage puzzle as it increases nutrient quality and aids in balancing the microflora in the rumen. Common Sulfur Sources Type of Sulfur Molecular Formula Common Presence Amount of Sulfur Non-Soluble (S) Elemental Sulfur 100% Semi-Soluble CaSO4 Calcium Sulfate or Gypsum 15–17% Soluble (Organic) (NH4)2SO4 Ammonium Sulfate 24% MgSO4.7H2O Epsom Salt 13% KMgSO4 Kainite 23% K2SO4 Potassium Sulfate 18% NH4S2O3 Ammonium Thiosulfate 10–26% What is sulfur? Sulfur is one of the 17 elements essential to crop production. This is because, according to the International Plant Nutrition Institute, plants almost exclusively use sulfate as their primary source of nutrition. It can be found in high levels in salt domes and volcanic deposits, typically in its elemental form. But it is also present in almost all soil types in smaller quantities. Plants receive sulfur through two primary mediums: Soil: The sulfur found in soil is typically organic sulfate that has been converted from elemental sulfur by soil bacteria. Ninety-five percent of plant sulfur uptake is in the organic form of sulfate. Air: Inorganic sulfur dioxide is often absorbed through the leaves and stoma. What role does sulfur play in forage plant and dairy cow processes? Required by both plants and animals, sulfur appears in every living cell and is essential for the synthesis of certain amino acids and proteins. A deficiency of sulfur in the soil can lead to deficiencies in the cow. Nutritionists recommend 0.2 percent of sulfur or sulfate in the diet of cattle, and ensuring your forage has enough sulfur is the easiest and most cost-effective way to manage sulfur requirements for the ration. Most of the dietary sulfur required by the cow is actually utilized by the rumen microbes for amino acid production. By feeding the microbes, the cow can produce amino acids, enzymes and proteins that then contribute to cow health, milk production and quality. Not only will the sulfate aid the cow, but plants use sulfate for chlorophyll formation, which contributes to higher sugar content and nutrients, resulting in greener, fuller foliage. What does our current sulfur landscape look like? In recent years, there has been a decrease in soil sulfur content as well as an increased demand on the soil for higher crop yields, and the fact that many fertilizers contain little to no sulfur is the primary reason for our current depletion of sulfur in the top soil. Secondary causes include erosion and mineralization. How to recognize a sulfur deficiency Since high-yielding crops often don’t receive adequate amounts of sulfur or receive it at inopportune times, it is important to be able to recognize a sulfur deficiency. Thankfully, if presented in its organic form, sulfate can quickly be absorbed in two to three days, which helps avoid leaching as you fertilize. If you notice some of the following signs of sulfate deficiency, it is recommended to provide a sulfur treatment two to four days before cutting forage to increase chlorophyll, resulting in a fuller, energy-rich harvest. This short-term solution can be done by applying biostimulant products, as a sulfur application would need to take place much earlier in order to keep the plant healthy and growing well. Signs of sulfur deficiency include: Yellowing of young growth; yellowing of old growth indicates a nitrogen shortage. Curling of young leaves. Diminished foliage. ​ Photo is provided courtesy of the International Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI). Although sulfur is present in the soil, it is often below recommended standards. Furthermore, in its inorganic sulfur state, it cannot be properly taken up by the plant until it has been converted to organic sulfate. By checking your forage crop for sulfur deficiency and treating as needed, you can increase the sugar and nutrient quality of your forage and provide sulfur to your herd to support rumen microflora health.

And perhaps there is a sort of magic. We’ve put together four reasons why Ireland is a promised land for dairy cows, a place where blessings flow out to the world in the form of butter, milk, infant formula, yogurt and cheese. 1. The comfortable climate Pack your wellies! There’s a reason Ireland’s rolling hills appear so green and lush. Rainfall is common on the island. The east typically experiences 30 to 40 inches of rainfall per year, and the showers are even more abundant in the west, which receives between 40 and 50 inches. But the mountainous regions of Ireland top them all, literally; rainfall there can exceed 118 inches per year! In the winter months, the average temperature ranges from 40 to 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Summers stay cool, with temperatures ranging from 57 to 61 degrees Fahrenheit. Despite the rain, the climate remains relatively comfortable for cows and farmers all year long. 2. The greener grass Generous rainfall, mild weather conditions and rich soils contribute to an abundance of grass for pasture. In Ireland, the dairy farming schedule is dependent on this grass. When cows calve in the spring, they eat as much grass as they can during their 300-day lactation period. More than 80 percent of Ireland’s agricultural land is devoted to pasture, hay and grass silage for this exact reason! The land area of Ireland is 6.9 million hectares, of which 4.4 million hectares is used for agriculture (DAFM, 2014). 3. A growing milk market In 2014, the Irish dairy industry had an estimated value of €3.06 billion ($3.61 billion) in exports to 140 countries, and its milk production is expected to increase approximately 50 percent by 2020! According to the Central Statistics Office in Ireland, 2016 domestic milk output checked in at 6,654 million litres, which led to the production of: 527 million litres, or 139 million gallons, of milk sold for human consumption. 198,700 tonnes (219,000 U.S. tons) of butter. 117,700 tonnes (129,700 U.S. tons) of skimmed milk powder. 205,000 tonnes (225,900 U.S. tons) of cheese. There are approximately 139,600 family farms in Ireland. Although they manage only 1 percent of the world’s dairy cows, they are responsible for producing more than 15 percent of the world’s infant formula! 4. There is more than one cow for every four Irish people! In 2016, the total number of dairy cows in Ireland hit a record high of 1.39 million cows. Comparing this to the population of Ireland of 4.773 million, this means there is just about one cow for every four Irish people. Come see Ireland for yourself on our Great Green Getaway.

The pop of a peach skin. The sweet lick of a summertime ice cream. Food — it awakens our senses to memories, to moments, to the people who’ve mattered most in our lives. For Alltech dairy specialist Tom Lorenzen of Wisconsin, a poppy seed pie evokes sweet remembrances of mom. Tom began working for a registered milking short-horn dairy as a child. For 17 years, every other day he brought home fresh milk from the dairy to his mother in tin milking cans. And that’s when mama would work her magic. She skimmed the cream off the top of the milk to make whipped cream for a host of delights, including her popular poppy seed pie. The pie, featuring butter and whole milk fresh from the dairy, was the highlight of family gatherings and holidays.

Perhaps you’ve already started thinking about how to increase your crop quality or increase your yield next year. As you consider how to better your crops, there are a few things you can do now to prepare your soil for the winter and the eventual spring. Setting your soil up for success 1. Broadcast or drill in a cover crop Topsoil has been a big topic of discussion across the globe. Each year, erosion eliminates some of our fields’ topsoil, and it takes many years to try and rebuild it, if it can be done at all. One way to maintain the top soil in your fields is to keep it covered throughout the winter by broadcasting or drilling in a cover crop post-harvest. 2. Apply a soil amendment One of the challenges of minimum tillage or no-till practices is the buildup of residue on the soil post-harvest and pre-plant. To help reduce this buildup of residue and use it to benefit your soil, try applying a soil amendment like Soil-Set®. By breaking down that buildup of residue, it will turn into organic matter for the soil, and planting may be a bit easier, too. 3. Get your soil tested Many people only soil test their fields on a biannual or triannual basis, making it difficult to have a solid understanding of what is going on in their fields year after year. By getting your soil tested post-harvest, you can have a better idea of what you need to apply in the spring to get the most out of your soil and ultimately grow a better crop. Many agriculture retailers offer this as a service and can help with the planning of proper nutrient placement and timing once the results are back.

Agriculture’s impact on land and water Currently, agriculture takes up about 40% of the Earth’s land area. The total amount of cropland is roughly equivalent to the landmass of South America. Pasture takes up about the same area as Africa. As agriculture demands more land, the inevitable result is deforestation, with agriculture and deforestation combined responsible for 25% of our greenhouse gas production. Agriculture’s water consumption is an even more serious problem. Nearly 70% of the Earth’s freshwater is used for agriculture. Lakes across the world are being depleted, and the Colorado River no longer flows to the ocean. Some of our most important aquifers are being drawn down past the point of recovery. Ag-tech: Savior of a hungry, malnourished and growing world? With so many resources going to agriculture, how is it possible that people still go to bed hungry? According to Bobo, 9 million people die from hunger and malnutrition each year, far more than any other cause. That means that 25,000 people die each day from hunger and malnutrition. And we will need to produce 60% to 100% more food by 2050. So, why is Jack Bobo optimistic? Because agricultural technology has made incredible improvements in the last few decades. We are producing more food with fewer resources than ever before. Bobo compared corn production inputs per bushel for 1980 and 2011. The improvement was striking: 40% less land 60% less erosion 50% less water 40% less energy 35% fewer greenhouse gases It seems the ability to produce more food with fewer resources should make everyone optimistic about the future of agriculture. Clearly, that isn’t the case. According to Bobo, “consumers have never cared more, nor known less, how their food was produced.” Farmers make up roughly 2% of the U.S. population. Consequently, very few people even know a farmer today, and they have very little knowledge of how their food is actually grown. “If people don’t understand your industry, then it’s up to you to change that,” said Bobo. Some food companies actually compound the problem by using outdated imagery of very small farms to market their products. Or, some will market to misperceptions because it is more in their interest to cater to that belief than to eradicate it. Distrust of agricultural science and technology can result in regulations that will make it difficult to meet the challenge of feeding 9 billion by 2050. It’s important, according to Bobo, that scientists work to gain people’s trust by telling their stories and explaining why they do what they do instead of just presenting the science. “If people don’t trust you, the science doesn’t matter,” said Bobo.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/jack-bobo-ag-innovation-next-most-important-35-years-planet","title":"\n\n                    Jack Bobo: Ag innovation for the next most important 35 years on the planet\n                    ","date":"May 23, 2017","contentLength":536}},{"pageContent":"Through the incorporation of new technology, efficiency in crop production has soared; however, so has the demand for more sustainable management practices. Today, there is more scrutiny than ever before from consumers regarding conventional herbicides, fungicides and insecticides, and regulations are tightening. “Complete replacement of synthetic chemistries is impractical for producers,” said Dr. Steven Borst, Alltech Crop Science compliance manager. “Unfortunately, however, we are running out of silver bullets.” Borst believes the future of integrated pest management (IPM) programs will include the best tactics from a variety of approaches, including nutritional and natural technologies. “Used in conjunction with the best conventional approaches, producers can reduce inputs while maintaining crop quality and improving sustainability measures,” he said. Nutritionals: Giving crops the building blocks to defend themselves A balanced plant nutritional program is a key component of an effective IPM program. “If a plant is not healthy from a nutritional standpoint, it will not be able to defend itself against a potential pathogen attack,” said Borst. Healthy plants can have a better chance of resisting disease pressures, and bioavailable micronutrients can naturally support plants’ inherent defenses. “If you can trick a plant into thinking it’s going to be attacked, then the plant can develop its own metabolic pathways to fight the disease,” he explained. However, plants are not naturally proactive. “They are reactive organisms,” explained Brian Springer, CCA, Alltech Crop Science technical services manager. “They respond to their environments. Something has to trigger a reaction in a plant to be defensive, unlike an immune system that can react on its own. By using biologicals, such as nutritionals and activators, we can elicit a response in the plant.” The dynamics between plants and their environment, including the complex microbial world in which they live, is being further researched by Alltech Crop Science and others. This week in an article titled “Scientists Hope to Cultivate an Immune System for Crops,” The New York Times reported that it is a dense ecological web to untangle. Untangling the ecological web calls for a new approach Efficient crop management is moving to a prescriptive/proactive management of inputs, rather than a reactive approach. “We’ve been taught to scout fields, find what’s wrong and then fix it,” said Springer. “We’re moving to a new perspective where we can not only act on plant health, but also improve soil health instead of acting on disease.” Better nutrient management, especially nitrogen, is a key component of this movement and is important to sustainability. “The definition of soil health is different for every farmer, since every cropping system is different,” added Springer. “It’s important to find out what amounts of nutrients are going to be available during the growing season.” This includes organic nitrogen in the soil that can be fed through amino acids. To this end, he mentioned that the University of Illinois is now including an analysis of amino acids as part of their soil sampling. The goal is to help reduce the amount of fertilizer applied to fields and hopefully improve the environment by minimizing application of excess nitrogen. An additional benefit of incorporating biologicals is that the nitrogen in the soil is not as volatile and won’t leach like nitrates. Biofungicides are another tool in the natural crop protection arena. To read more about the use of this microbial technology in conjunction with conventional fungicides, click here. A total systems approach Alltech experts agree that a total systems approach will serve crop farmers best in the future. “We continue to research how and when to use biologicals — whether it’s natural activators, foliar micronutrients, natural inoculants or biofungicides — with conventional methods in cropping systems to help producers with environmental stewardship,” said Borst. “As any market progresses, we see increasing management of smaller and smaller pieces of the total system,” concluded Springer. “This is the next layer down that we are fine-tuning.” Dr. Steven Borst was a presenter at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference.

Once, milk was a beverage made only by dairy cows. But a walk into the \"milk\" section of today’s supermarket would suggest otherwise. With a growing selection of milk alternatives made from soy, almond, rice, hemp, coconut and cashew, consumers have become increasingly confused by the health attributes touted by both milk and milk alternatives. While these plant-based products make up less than 10 percent of milk sales, they are gaining ground. Even popular coffee chains have hopped on the milk alternative train — will your mocha be made with 2%, 1%, nonfat…or soy, almond or coconut milk? Plant-based milks have been perceived, or sometimes advertised, as healthier alternatives to dairy, but that’s not always the case. Milk alternatives were created to accommodate consumers who have an allergy, are lactose intolerant or have vegan dietary restrictions, not because they are nutritionally equivalent or better. Check the (nutrition) facts on the milk carton Milk alternatives, with the exception of soy milk, have considerably less protein than dairy milk. Although many of the plant products fortify their beverages with additional nutrients, they also have a long list of added ingredients, including sugar, salt and thickening agents. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee identified low- and fat-free dairy as part of a healthy diet. With the exception of fortified soy milk, the same cannot be said for milk alternatives, which lack the quantity and quality of nutrients milk has, including vitamin D, calcium and potassium. Milk, yogurt and cheese are naturally nutrient-rich foods that provide many essential nutrients that contribute to good health at all stages of life. Milk is a natural source of calcium and vitamin B12, riboflavin, phosphorus and potassium. It also contains smaller amounts of other nutrients including vitamin A, other B-vitamins, vitamin D, magnesium, iodine, selenium and zinc. Dairy foods are also excellent sources of high quality protein that contain essential amino acids, which the human body cannot synthesize itself. 1 What type of milk is best for toddlers? Cow’s milk is not recommended during the first 12 months of life. However, fortified cow’s milk is an important dietary component of a toddler’s diet because of its high-quality protein, calcium, and vitamins A and D. Calcium is involved in bone growth, tooth development, and muscle contraction, and it may play a role in the regulation of blood pressure and body fat.2 One study showed that children who consumed milk with the noontime meal were the only group to meet or exceed 100 percent of the daily Dietary Reference Intake for calcium (i.e., 500 to 800 mg).3 Two or three servings of milk or dairy products per day are recommended to meet these requirements.

This means that a hiccup in silage preparation can lead to a year of poor forage quality, while a year of exceptional weather and silage management can offer a year of quality feed and optimal herd health. What happens now has long-range consequences, whether good or bad. Farmers deal with many factors on a daily basis that are out of their control, with silage being one of them. Understanding what aspects of growing, chopping and ensilaging forages we can control can make all the difference between a year of mitigating forage issues and battling marginal milk production and a year of optimum herd health and prosperity. Over my years of experience in silage management, I have developed four practical and proven tips for making great silage. 1. Start with quality This means you need to make the proper seed selections from the very start! The following factors are important when selecting seeds, so be sure to consult with your seed salesman before you make a decision: Yield potential Digestibility Grain content 2. Proper moisture and maturity Harvesting your crops at the proper moisture and maturity optimizes the benefit for the animals. For corn silage, the proper moisture should be approximately 65–68 percent. What can happen to my silage if I chop when the moisture content is too high? What can happen to my silage if I chop when the moisture content is too low? Dry matter losses Protein degradation High butyric acid concentrations Reduced palatability Reduced packing potential Reduced density, which can lead to increased spoilage, increased mold growth and mycotoxins It is important to remember that chop height is also important. For corn silage, the normal chop length should be 6 inches. You can increase the quality and digestibility of the corn silage by increasing the chop length to 12–16 inches, but it is important to remember that we lose between 7–15 percent of our yield by chopping at that height. 3. Storage and filling of the harvest With the popularity of high-horsepower, self-propelled choppers and custom operators, we can get a lot done in a very short amount of time when filling our silage piles, but being able to ensure that we get good packing and preservation of our forages is important. If you are using one of these machines, you may need to increase the quantity of tractors or weight used after placing the silage on the pile. Remember: When a tractor is compressing a pile, it can only efficiently compress up to six inches underneath the tractor tire, so layers need to be added in increments of six inches or less. A lot of times when I am on the farm, I hear, “When the silage starts coming in really fast, we just let it all come in and spend a few hours at the end packing it down with the tractor,” and that is not something I want to hear. If you aren’t spending the time during the gradual filling of the silage pile and instead wait until the end to pack it down with the tractor, you are significantly decreasing the quality of the silage on the top and wasting time. 4. Be patient! After harvest and when storing your feed, be patient as to when you are going to feed that silage. I understand there are times when we need to feed before we would like to on our forages, but we would like to try to keep the silage covered for at least four to six weeks before we open the pile or bunker to ensure that fermentation is completed and we have stable feed to provide to our herd. If it works for your operation, I would strongly suggest you allow three to four months prior to opening silage piles or bunkers to ensure you have quality feed for your animals.

Vasconcellos, Universidade Estadual de Maringá, Brazil Because cats originated from arid regions, they have a superior ability to adapt to a low consumption of water in comparison to other species, such as humans and canines (NCR, 2006). Although this could be perceived as an advantage, a low water intake has a high impact on the development of urinary tract diseases such as urolithiasis and idiopathic cystitis (Little, 2016). These two diseases commonly affect young cats and are frequently related to nutritional and environmental management deficiencies. It is estimated that between 1.5 percent and 3 percent of clinical cases are caused by these two urinary illnesses (Forrester et al., 2010). It is also estimated that these two diseases are responsible for 80 percent of all related urinary tract issues in felines. However, this can be reduced or even prevented through nutritional intervention and environmental management. The most common clinical signs of urolithiasis or cystitis are (Little, 2016). Although diagnosis and clinical treatment are relatively simple, it is very common to see recurrences of these illnesses. Nutritional and environmental strategies should therefore be constant to reduce the possibility of reappearing problems. On nutrition, there are two crucial aspects to consider when preventing issues in the lower urinary tract, including controlling salt levels and the pH of the urine. It is recommended to promote water intake, as this is the best way to avoid supersaturation of salts in the urine and the eventual development of crystals and urinary stones. Managing urinary pH, will help avoid formation of kidney stones. The general rule is to keep urinary pH between 6.2 and 6.8. Different strategies have been implemented to promote water intake, such as providing access to water around the house, offering clean and fresh water, palatable drinks, wet diets and the increase of salt levels in dry food. All these strategies have been proven to work successfully in cats facing urinary issues. The use of one or more strategies combined could be beneficial (Forrester, 2010). Different types of kidney stones can be developed depending on the level of pH. The pH conditions, combined with salt saturation in the urine, promote the precipitation of salts and therefore the development of uroliths. The most effective strategy to regulate the pH through diet intervention is by adjusting the composition of macroelements (e.g., sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chlorine, sulfur and phosphorus). Cationic macroelements such as sodium, potassium, calcium and magnesium promote urine alkalization, while anionic elements such as chlorine, sulfur and phosphorus favor acidification. The levels and concentration of these macroelements could be formulated in the diet. Salts with acidification or alkalization properties are frequently used (Jeremias et al., 2013). In conclusion, promoting water intake and controlling urinary pH are the foundation to preventing urinary tract infections in felines. It is also important to look after the environment, as urolithiasis and cystitis are correlated to environmental stressors such as addition of a new pet into the household, extended stays of guests or home renovation.

Dairy farmers are, and should be, chief among those concerned about the well-being of their animals. Uncomfortable animals are not productive animals. The first and best way to care for your herd is to reduce discomfort and stress caused by husbandry procedures, and this requires early recognition of any pain. Since cows do not communicate verbally, veterinarians and dairy producers have to pay close attention to changes in cow behavior. Teeth grinding, vocalizing, head pressing or, less frequently, colic behavior are clear signs of severe discomfort. Earlier identification of less severe behavioral changes in the cow will help detect illness, leading to better treatment options and improved health outcomes, including milk yield. In this video, Dr. Silivo Miranda explains his 5-minute facial assessment. To hear it in Spanish, click here. Understanding cow discomfort by facial expression We are developing new guides to facial expression to help farmers detect if their cows are experiencing pain. This program is based on identifying and recognizing specific features on the cow’s face. Cows change their facial expression when stressed, and this spontaneous facial expression is considered an innate response, which is very difficult to suppress. With a little practice, this evaluation can be done quickly in five minutes, and the farmer, with help from his veterinarian, can decide if the cow needs treatment or not. Nose: It is a good sign if she lets you get close to the nose. If the facial muscles are relaxed, it means she isn’t in pain. Strained nostrils dilated with lines above the nostrils and tension of the facial muscle suggest pain. Also, an increase of tonus of the lips could indicate pain. Eyes: A cow has incredible peripheral vision and relies on vision for many things, from navigating the barn to finding feed. That is why bright, clear eyes, free of any crusting, are important for a healthy cow. A stare/withdrawn appearance and tension of the muscles above the eyes that may be seen as “furrow lines” indicate pain. Ears: Should be forward. If the ears are tense and backward or low, also called “lambs ears,” this might indicate discomfort or pain. Pain evaluation is an essential tool to ensure animal welfare in the modern dairy industry. Remember, happy, pain-free cows mean more milk and better reproductive health.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/cow-comfort-5-minute-facial-assessment","title":"\n\n                    Cow comfort: 5-minute facial assessment\n                    ","date":"January 16, 2018","contentLength":401}},{"pageContent":"In a recent live webinar, Dr. Kristen Brennan, research manager at Alltech, discussed how the science of nutrigenomics can be applied to pet nutrition. Click here and sign-up to view the recorded webinar and the interactive question-and-answer session. Precise nutrition: What does it mean? When we talk about precision nutrition, or target nutrition, we are referring to specific dog/cat foods for specific breeds, age groups or sizes of dogs/cats. We know that certain breeds might be predisposed to joint arthritis (e.g., larger dogs), and other breeds might be more sensitive to gastrointestinal issues. The idea behind precise nutrition is designing the best nutrition for an animal based on its genetics, physical build and lifestyle. How long has nutrigenomics been around? What drove this technology to the forefront of nutrition? Nutrigenomics has been around since the evolution of the first living thing, because nutrition has always influenced the genome. We just figured out a way to measure it. Really, the sequencing of genomes is what drove this technology forward. Once we understood what each part of the genome coded for, we could capture that information. What advantages are there for us to use nutrigenomics studies compared to tradition nutrition studies? The number one advantage is purely the sheer volume of information we can get. We can profile thousands of genes and their activity in one snapshot versus just a few phenotypic measures like body weight. Another benefit is that these can be relatively non-invasive. We need only small samples of tissue and that can be as simple as bloodwork. Can we use nutrigenomics to explain why some breeds respond different to the same diets? Down the road, that is the goal. We are starting to understand changes in the genome’s sequence (called SNPs) and their role in health. Eventually, we hope we can link those changes to how dogs or cats respond to diets. The work being done now is more “big picture.” Gene expression: What does up- and down-regulating mean? Which is better? By up-regulating (“turning on”) or down-regulating (“turning off”) genes, the body changes the levels of the proteins that make up structures and functions in the cells. This, in turn, alters physiological processes like energy production or immune response. Nutrigenomics is the field of research we use to study if changes in genes occur with changes in the animal’s diet. Which is better: up-regulating or down-regulating? The answer is, it depends. For instance, if you have genes that are responsible for cancer cell progression and you see an increase (i.e., the genes turn on, or up-regulate), that is a negative thing, but if you see a decrease (i.e., the genes turn off, or down-regulate), that is a good thing. However, if you have genes that are involved in a different function, such as protein translation or energy, increases (up-regulation) are good. What do we know about obesity and gene expression? More than half of all cats and dogs are obese in the U.S. Nutrigenomics helps to identify the molecular markers associated with, or before, body weight gain, potentially offering an opportunity to identify targets for nutritional intervention before a problem becomes bigger, literally. Nutrients and molecules: What is the impact on gene expression? What we’ve seen on a molecular level is that the form of the nutrients — for example, organic trace minerals versus inorganic — is extremely influential to how an animal responds. By observing genetic expression, we can determine which form of a trace mineral will have the most beneficial effect. Nutrients and energy: What is the real benefit of organic selenium? We like to talk about the mitochondria being the “powerhouse” or “battery” pack of the cell. Every cell in your body has mitochondria, which provide energy. We have found that selenium plays a role in controlling the gene that essentially says, “make more mitochondria.” PGC-1 alpha is a key regulator that says to your body, “We need more capacity for energy, so let’s make more mitochondria.” Nutrients and inflammation: Omega-3 fatty acids can have an impact Nutrigenomics is telling us that omega-3 fatty acids can decrease the transcription genes involved in joint inflammation, opening the doors for potential nutritional therapy or alleviation of symptoms. Nutrients and digestive health: Other applications of nutrigenomics By using nutrigenomics, we have found that special molecules from yeast-based polysaccharides (prebiotic fibers) can increase goblet cell counts and mucin, protecting the mucous membrane and, ultimately, the intestine from chemical and physical injury. The bottom line on nutrigenomics and pet nutrition: Nutrition and the environment are the two main factors that can affect the health of a pet. Nutrigenomics examines the nutrient-gene interactions on a genome-wide scale. Better understanding of nutrition is possible through nutrigenomics. If we understand the “why,” we can figure out the “how.” Nutrigenomics enables us to design diets to target specific concerns such as obesity and joint inflammation.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/nutrigenomics-uncovering-effects-nutrition-pets","title":"\n\n                    Nutrigenomics: Uncovering the effects of nutrition in pets\n                    ","date":"February 5, 2018","contentLength":837}},{"pageContent":"When choosing between organic and conventionally grown produce, we tend to see it as an “all or nothing” decision. However, many growers are using techniques that have traditionally been seen in organic farming and are incorporating them into conventional farming. The gap between organic and conventional growers is narrowing with every passing year as new technology is making it easier to incorporate more natural methods into traditional management practices. Soil management Many growers are turning away from using traditional tillage practices in an effort to nurture the agribiome in the soil. Instead of churning the soil annually, many will now till only when needed to combat soil compaction. Soil testing Soil testing is done to guide precision nutrient application. The grower can apply only the nutrients that are shown as deficient on the tests and only in the correct areas, thus increasing the efficacy of the nutrients while decreasing some of the costs associated with soil treatments. Cover crops Many conventional growers are also using various cover crops and polyculture, the practice of growing multiple crops in the same area. These practices aid in maintaining nutrient-rich soils through organic matter breakdown, and they also help prevent weeds. Crop scouting Early detection of pests, diseases and nutrient deficiencies through crop scouting can reduce the use of pesticides and other inputs and allow for more precise applications of treatments to address crop issues. A natural approach Naturally based crop inputs, such as those that use amino acid technology, are being used by growers throughout the plant growth cycle. These inputs result in improved soil biology, plant health and greater yields, all while decreasing the use of synthetic inputs. More growers are coming to the realization that there is no need to compromise growth, yield or profit in the pursuit of improved sustainability.

I grew up in a small city, where my parents raised dairy cattle. That is when my interest in studying dairy cattle began. After I finished high school, I was sure that I wanted to study animal science, and I completed my bachelor’s degree in animal science at Santa Catarina State University. I received my master’s degree from the Luiz de Queiroz College of Agriculture at the University of São Paulo, where my research evaluated the effects of fatty acid supplementation on the performance and metabolism of dairy cows grazing tropical pastures. My doctoral dissertation at Michigan State University examines the effects of altering the dietary ratio of fatty acids on the energy partitioning of dairy cows under different physiological conditions. My first study from my research in Michigan was the base for my application to the Alltech Young Scientist program. My research has focused on altering the fatty acid profile of dairy cow diets and how that impacts feed efficiency and energy metabolism in dairy cows. The results suggest that different fatty acids can alter energy partitioning between the mammary gland and adipose tissue, which may allow for the application of different fatty acids in different situations according to the metabolic priority and needs of dairy cows. This may provide key information on how to group cows to properly feed them to meet their requirements and maximize milk fat yield. There is tremendous potential for increased profitability and farm efficiency by improving milk fat yield through improved understanding of how fatty acids are metabolized and partitioned to different tissues. Being selected as the global winner of the Alltech Young Scientist program was the biggest achievement of my career, especially since I competed with other brilliant scientists with very solid research. It has certainly given me more confidence in presenting my research. However, this prize was not only a personal achievement, but also the achievement of several other collaborators and mentors that I have had throughout my career. I will complete my Ph.D. by next year, and I would like to continue working with research and training people.

All feed manufacturers who manufacture, process, pack or hold animal food for consumption in the United States must comply with the FSMA. In general, this includes those who register under Section 415 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (also known as the Bioterrorism Act). It’s important to note that not complying is considered a prohibited act. Recently, Hubbard Feeds hosted a series of meetings for its customers to help them prepare for the FSMA. Keith Epperson of Epperson Consulting & Associates, LLC, led the discussion by giving attendees an overview of the FSMA and how it affects their businesses. Below are the key takeaways from Keith’s presentation. Deadlines for larger businesses to comply with the FSMA went into effect in 2016. The current compliance date for many feed dealers is September 2017 for Current Good Manufacturing Practices. A more detailed outline of compliance dates is shown in the chart below, provided by the American Feed Industry Association. Compliance dates for FSMA Business Size Subpart B Current Good Manufacturing Practice Subpart C Hazard Analysis and Risk-Based Preventive Controls All Others Sept. 19, 2016 Sept. 18, 2017 Small Businesses (&lt; 500 FTE) * *full time employees Sept. 18, 2017 Sept. 17, 2018 Very Small Businesses (&lt; $2.5 million/year) Sept. 17, 2018 Sept. 17, 2019 Critical prevention efforts The first of several topics discussed at the meetings was the importance of training employees on their job responsibilities. Having qualified individuals who understand what they do and the consequences of not performing those tasks correctly is a key aspect of food safety. Documenting when training sessions occur is an important part of FSMA compliance, because if it’s not written down, it’s assumed it didn’t happen. Housekeeping and maintenance of equipment and facilities was also discussed frequently. When inspectors walk through a facility, it’s easy to see what type of housekeeping is being done. A regular maintenance schedule can prevent breakdowns or improper manufacturing and processing of feeds. Biosecurity was another topic heavily emphasized throughout the meetings. Examples of this include documenting and visually inspecting incoming ingredient trailers to record what was on a previous load, trucking of finished feed, and even keeping brooms and equipment separate depending on where they are used. Planning ahead Another aspect of the FSMA that feed manufacturers will be required to complete is a food safety plan. Every feed manufacturer must conduct a hazard analysis to identify and evaluate — based on experience, illness data, scientific reports and other information — known or reasonably foreseeable hazards for each type of animal food manufactured, processed, packed or held at their facility to determine whether there are any hazards requiring a preventive control. The hazard analysis must be written regardless of its outcome. Some examples of hazards in animal food are: Biological hazards: Salmonella spp. Listeria monocytogenes Chemical hazards: Mycotoxins Pesticides and process-related or industrial chemicals Drug carryover Nutrient deficiencies or toxicities Physical hazards: Stones Glass Metal Moving forward The compliance date for small businesses with less than 500 full-time employees is September 17, 2018, which gives feed manufacturers time to do their hazard analysis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently announced they will delay inspections for the hazard analysis and risk-based preventive controls portion of the FSMA until Sept. 2018. However, while the inspections may have been delayed, feed manufacturers will still be required to meet compliance deadlines. The FDA has launched a food safety plan builder to help owners create a food safety plan for their businesses.

In fact, despite the continued preference for pork in Asia, current growth means that global chicken meat consumption will exceed that of pork by 2022. Egg consumption continues to grow as well because eggs are inexpensive, mild-tasting and easy to process and include in other foods. Universal acceptance by almost all cultures and all religions ensures that poultry will continue to prosper. Although touted as the world’s most efficient protein, poultry producers actually manage their flocks with very limited information. Today, it takes 1.4 kilograms of feed to produce 1 kilogram of live-weight meat, and genetics offer the opportunity to reach a 1:1 ratio. Chicken producers know the birds’ weights when coming in and going out as well as average feed and water consumption. Egg farms at least have the daily data point of average egg production for a group of birds, but managing for averages makes production inefficiencies inevitable. What would make for better poultry production? From a production standpoint, individual real-time body weights, feed and water consumption. From a husbandry and welfare perspective, knowing the stress levels in the bird and bird comfort assessed through body temperatures and air quality factors, such as carbon dioxide and ammonia. From a disease management outlook, the ability to spot disease or find morbid birds before the entire flock is affected. From a food safety perspective, enhanced Salmonella, Campylobacter and E. coli detection. From a food processing perspective, increased yield. In the next 30 years, we will see another 3 billion people inhabit the Earth, and the middle class of urban dwellers will continue to rise. Poultry farming must respond. Farmers must farm data, not just chickens, and in doing so, harness new digital technologies and information to improve efficiencies and respond to the growing requirements of proactively engaged consumers (“prosumers”). These eight digital technologies provide a useful framework to describe the plethora of novel technologies arriving in the marketplace that can help producers manage their flocks in a more efficient and sustainable way. 3D printing prosthetics What is the realistic future of 3D printing in the poultry industry? Poultry operations would benefit from the on-site printing of plastic or metal parts when the ones on the farm require replacing. The University of Western Australia’s head of mechanical and chemical engineering, Tim Sercombe, has developed a printer that would use a metal powder that represents about 20 percent of the total cost of the part. Smaller part sizes might take a day to complete, but when compared to ordering and waiting for delivery of a part, the potential to save downtime on a farm could be considerable. Aurora Labs is focusing its efforts on agriculture, citing the opportunity for rural or remote farmers in Australia to come to their own rescue! One of the more inventive ways in which 3D printing can affect the poultry industry is through life-saving techniques. Reproducing feet, legs and even beaks has already been applied for pet birds. One example includes researchers from the University of Calgary, who created prosthetic feet for Foghorn the rooster after he lost both of his feet, most likely an unfortunate result of severe frostbite. Then there’s Dudley the duck, who received an entire prosthetic leg (including the knee joint!) from the combined efforts of a 32-year-old mechanical engineer and architect who worked with Proto3000, a 3D printing company based out of Ontario. Imagine the opportunity for preserving high-value breeding stock such as parents, grandparents or great-grandparents, where continuing the genetic line is critical. Foghorn the rooster gets new feet! Picture courtesy of Riley Brandt/University of Calgary. Robots doing the dirty work One of the most practical applications of digital technology in the poultry industry is that of robots. There are a multitudinous number of repetitive tasks that robots could assist with. Poultry houses require nearly constant attention — cleaning and sanitizing, collecting eggs and checking birds. This is time-consuming, monotonous work, but it would not bother a robot. Additionally, robots are more precise, thorough and honest about the work they do compared to their human counterparts. An article by Benjamin Ruiz also points out how robots can help from a human welfare standpoint. Check out Wageningen University’s video demonstrating a robot that detects and picks up each egg with great care. France-based Octopus Robots designs entirely autonomous robots to prevent and control disease and infection in poultry houses. The bots also evaluate environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, ammonia, sound and brightness. Image courtesy of Tibot Robotics. Another French robotic company, Tibot, explains that robots can discourage chickens from laying eggs on the floor and also keep the birds moving for an added health benefit. These attributes can result in cost-savings for producers in product and labor while appealing to welfare advocates. For more specialized tasks, including feeding and monitoring, Metabolic Robots designed robotic feeders that can increase feed efficiencies, lower mortality rates and alert the producer to potential disease concerns. “Nanny robots” are used by Thailand’s Charoen Pokphand Group (CP Group) to maintain healthy flocks of around 3 million laying hens. If the robots detect an ill bird, humans are alerted and the bird is removed immediately. These automations will reduce outbreaks of bird flu and foodborne illnesses, improving the safety of the entire supply chain from producer to consumer. Also with safety in mind, Tyson recently announced the opening of its high-tech hatchery in Springdale, Arkansas. The operation spans 75,000 square feet (7,500 square miles) and hosts six robotic arms designed to replicate tasks that would otherwise result in worker fatigue. Drones The opportunity for drones in chicken houses may seem a little farfetched. There is concern that the drone could make the flock nervous and cause undue stress. To this point, an experiment by Georgia Tech in 2015 showed the birds were not yet ready for this technology, compared to robots, which are probably better suited for indoor tasks anyway. Free-range or yard-kept chickens and turkeys that roam fields freely would be a better application for drone technology, which could herd, protect and monitor them. Adaptation of avian species to drones would probably require training but will most likely succeed outdoors. Sensors Sensors probably represent the easiest of the eight technologies to implement. This is partly due to lower implementation costs, but also because the benefits are immediately recognized. Big Dutchman is one of the top names in modern poultry housing. Its DOL 53 is a sensor designed to measure ammonia, a common problem in many hen houses. Both SKOV and Filipino Poultry use sensors to regulate and control the climate in the house, including ventilation and temperature. Rotem’s sensor is designed for carbon dioxide monitoring, which can reduce the negative effects high carbon dioxide concentrations can have on layers and breeders, resulting in significant cost savings. Greengage has a unique lighting system using sensors and LED bulbs to create a consistent lighting environment that stimulates better growth efficiencies in birds and also reduces costs. From a wearable sensor perspective, researchers — and even farmers — could gain a lot of insight into the health and well-being of broilers, layers, turkeys and ducks. Fitted with RFID tags, poultry could then be observed in a more natural environment, giving researchers the opportunity to learn from the animals. This information could be evaluated to determine everything from natural behaviors to inefficiencies in diet, greatly increasing the opportunity to help with production efficiencies. Studies conducted at the University of Michigan have used sensors to analyze how chickens use space in their pens in order to better understand how to design non-cage systems for the comfort and well-being of the hens. Artificial intelligence (AI) AI technologies have become the backbone of many other technologies. Robots, for example, use AI in the processing plant to improve efficiencies. Through a collaboration of efforts, iPoultry is a high-tech automated processing system first demonstrated at VIV Europe. Automating a procedure such as chicken deboning requires recognition of the shape and size of each chicken and individual adaptation. Artificial intelligence is the perfect technology for this application. Consider that a computer can analyze the difference in density and structure of meat versus bone, thereby making the most precise cut possible. This is a great example of combined technologies: robots perform the work that AI instructs them to do based on the data that sensors collect. The Gribbot by SINTEF is one such robot that can debone a chicken in two to three seconds, replacing up to 30 human operators! When combined with machine vision, companies like Gainco are also creating processors to achieve high productivity. Companies such as Porphyrio, PMSI, Impex Barneveld and Intelia all use AI to monitor and control the environment of the house. Sensors collect the information, software tracks it and AI adjusts the conditions of the house or alerts the farmer if there is a potential issue, such as an ill bird. All this information can be transferred to the farmer’s iPad or smartphone. This is all done in real time and can curb concerns and small issues before they become disastrous to the entire flock. Aside from saving humans from doing these tasks, there are opportunities for cost savings, such as optimized feed consumption and climate control, increased production through healthier flocks because of cleaner water and better systems management. All of this information can be stored and analyzed to increase uniformity in production, which will ultimately increase performance and overall flock health. Another AI application? Chicken translators! Many a poultry producer will attest that the sounds of the flock indicate health, comfort and overall well-being. By listening to and understanding the sounds of a healthy flock, producers can be tuned in to signals of distress and have a better chance of reducing stress or distress early on. A form of AI, machine vision, has been used to grade eggs as well as determine defects such as cracking or internal blood spots. It can also be used in assessing infertility in incubation by scanning eggs and learning which are fertile and which are not. An algorithm is then created, enabling the machine to determine the accuracy of fertility by over 98 percent by day five of incubation. A research study in Brazil used AI to better understand hen behavior and the difference in interactions when under thermal stress versus a comfortable environment. Specifically, they tapped into an area of research known as artificial neural networks, which makes it possible to “teach” computers how to do tasks using visual references and understand patterns. This was important because it reduced the chances that a researcher’s presence would alter the hen’s behavior, removed any subjectivity or misconception from the researcher’s standpoint, and allowed for a more precise calculation of the overall well-being of the hens. This technology has allowed a significant challenge within the layer industry to be overcome. Layers, of course, are designed to produce eggs for consumption. To replace laying hens, farmers have to incubate some eggs, but they cannot tell until they are hatched which are male and which are female. The ability to sex the eggs was the undertaking of Vital Farms, which has teamed up with Israeli technology company Novatrans to create Ovabrite. Using terahertz spectroscopy, the system can identify male eggs immediately after laying and sell them as unfertilized eggs for the farmer, allowing for significant cost savings within the layer industry. Augmented reality Augmented (or enhanced) reality is the ability to see things that the human eye cannot, using the non-visible spectrums of light, or to overlay information, including data interpretation, alongside what the person sees. The possible uses of the technology are wide-ranging, but so far, there are a few examples of real commercial applications. Georgia Tech had a student project in which it investigated the use of AR in the processing plant. The application of AR allows trimmers in factories to see how to cut the chicken carcass and accurately remove defective parts of the meat. Two methods are being tried. One is using a head-mounted display in which the trimmer could see a graphical overlay on each bird indicating the best location for cutting. Alternatively, the project also tested a laser scanner that was mounted near the processing line and indicated directly onto each bird where to make the cuts. The latter was generally considered more cost-effective, as all workers could use the same equipment. Apart from the benefits for farmers or processors, consumers may be the key to implementation. Transparency is becoming critical, as is having the ability to know where and how food is produced. Australian-based CHOICE offers all iPhone and Android users a free app that allows consumers to scan a code on the egg carton and download detailed information on where the eggs are from and information relating to their welfare conditions. Virtual reality (VR) The most obvious application for VR in the poultry industry is training, particularly processing. It could teach line workers in the processing plant the ideal way to trim meat from birds. Applied to free-range layer houses, it could teach employees how to walk through the house without frightening the birds, find errant eggs and check on hens. An example of VR is how McDonald’s has teamed up with The Lakes Free Range Egg Company to give customers an immersive virtual tour of the farm’s hen houses, ranges and pack houses. This technology is, however, expensive, and implementation is likely to be slow. Another eccentric option is to give the virtual reality experience to the chickens. Created by professor Austin Stewart at the University of Iowa, Second Livestock is a conceptual company that allows chickens to enjoy the free-range experience while remaining contained within the safety of the poultry house. The idea is that chickens are equipped with a virtual headset and see through a screen projection using goggles. In this way, chickens can be raised anywhere, even in urban areas, and feel the freedom of their virtual world, free from predators. While this company may not actually be producing these products, it is important to recognize that the technology is there and is on its way to becoming increasingly more affordable. Is this the future of chicken farming? Image courtesy of Second Livestock. Blockchain Blockchain’s opportunity in the poultry industry is its ability to resolve food safety and transparency issues. Walmart, Unilever, Nestlé and other food giants are working with IBM using blockchain technology to secure digital records and monitor supply chain management, ensuring traceability of the poultry products sold in stores. Blockchain can be used to monitor all aspects of the food supply chain, from farmers and producers to processors and distributors. This is Walmart’s third experiment with blockchain, and the increasing interest of other large food conglomerates demonstrates the unique capabilities of this technology. ZhongAn Technology has launched a technology incubator to develop blockchain technologies, citing that there is an expectation of specific applications within the poultry industry. The Chinese consume about 5 billion chickens a year but prefer dark meat rather than the breast meat favored by American consumers. Recently, the country has been allowed to export cooked chicken to the United States, and blockchain could be a way to alleviate any concerns about sourcing and production methods, eventually opening the way for raw exports. Internet of things (IoT) The internet of things is listed separately from the other eight technologies because it is the technology that connects all the others. For example, ZhongAn is working to make chicken production safer and will utilize a collaboration with Wopu, a company that specializes in the internet of things. IoT connects many of the sensors in a hen house to a smartphone, iPad or other devices, which is the case with SmartPoultry. A paper by Rupali Bhagwan Mahale gives detailed insight into the applications of IoT in farm monitoring with a focus on the poultry industry. LX IoT Cores offers technologies for improved efficiencies within the poultry sector through the use of combined sensor applications using cloud-based technologies and smart farming applications. M-Tech Systems offers a software package to track and trace all elements of the farm, including information gathered from sensors, but also potentially from various sources, from robots to veterinary activity and upstream supplier information. This overall management of the entire chain offers incredible advancements to traceability, which is becoming increasingly important to all food production worldwide. Cargill’s TechBro Flex takes a producer’s own data and creates predictive analytic options, allowing the customer to choose their path based on a choice of strategic scenarios. The big data advantage As we can collect more information on animals, including the bacteria in their digestive tract and how they respond to nutrition at the gene level, it becomes clear that farmers are learning how to manage vast amounts of data as much as they previously understood how to manage their animals. \"Farming the data\" to predict an individual animal’s growth requires the ability to interpret \"big data.\" Alltech has been creating complex algorithms to interpret the information they are collecting regarding the microbiome, nutrigenomics and pathogens, such as campylobacter or antibiotic resistant bacteria. Nutrigenomics allows us to generate information to feed the animal precisely, and DNA profiling helps us know exactly what specific bacteria are present. Without powerful data analysis, there is no way to take advantage of this. As we can collect more information on animals including the bacteria in their digestive tract and how they respond to nutrition at the gene level, it becomes clear that farmers are learning how to manage vast amounts of data as much as they previously understood how to manage their animals. ‘Farming the data’ to predict an individual animal’s growth requires the ability to interpret ‘Big data’.

Without powerful data analysis there is no way to take advantage of this. It is estimated that the world poultry production will increase 120 percent from 2010 to 2050. In order to meet this demand, feed conversion ratios and other production efficiencies must continue to improve. The incorporation of digital technologies, such as those listed above, will greatly aid in these efficiencies and help poultry producers to rise to the demands and meet the increasing needs of a global population. The framework for these eight technologies was first proposed in a PwC article.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/flocking-digital-future-poultry-technology","title":"\n\n                    Flocking to digital: The future of poultry technology\n                    ","date":"November 10, 2017","contentLength":3150}},{"pageContent":"Excessive plant growth can reflect hormonal imbalance Contrary to popular belief, plant growth is not directly linked to an increase in yield. For example, in beans, excessive vegetative development can lead to self-shading, a condition in which the lower leaves, where the productive areas of the plant are located, do not receive sunlight. This impedes photosynthesis, decreasing the productivity of the plant. According to agronomist Fransérgio Batista, grain specialist and technical manager for Alltech Crop Science, this occurrence signifies a hormonal imbalance in the plant. “There is a plant hormone, auxin, which is responsible for plant growth,” explained Batista. “When the plant develops excessively, it’s because there is too much of this hormone acting on the plant. This also inhibits the production of other hormones that are important to the plant.” Intent on improving the balance of his bean crop, Joel Ragagnin, a grower from Jataí, in the state of Goiás, Brazil, added natural products that are based on plant extracts, nutrients and amino acids to his management practices. This combination aids the crop in balanced plant development. “By having better control over plant growth, we can improve the productivity indexes on the farm,” said Ragagnin. According to Batista, because photosynthesis is vital to the plant, keeping leaves green and healthy should be a prime objective of crop management. “There are leaves from the lower to the upper parts of the plant,” said Batista. “A plant that produces is a plant that photosynthesizes in all its leaves. This is a key process for the plant.“ In addition to the use of crop inputs that contribute to the hormonal balance of the plant, the agronomist noted the importance of plant nutrition, the availability of water during the entire growth cycle and the control of pests and diseases for attaining adequate crop development. “Through these methods, it’s possible for the producer to have an even more significant response,” concluded Batista.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/growth-isnt-always-good","title":"\n\n                    Growth isn’t always good\n                    ","date":"December 31, 1969","contentLength":323}},{"pageContent":"It was “all hands on deck” on a recent Friday afternoon in the atrium at Alltech Corporate Headquarters in Nicholasville, Kentucky. Founder and president Dr. Pearse Lyons gathered staff for a soft launch of the company’s selenium-based yeast product AT-001, and to talk about research indicating its promise as a supplement to maintain cognitive function and brain health. In his remarks to the assembled Alltech staff, Dr. Lyons noted that the turning point had come about over 10 years ago when Alltech’s own nutrigenomic research indicated that its product Sel-Plex®, when fed to animals, was observed to favorably alter the activity of certain biological pathways that, according to scientific literature, are associated with several serious human illnesses, Alzheimer’s prominent among them. Alzheimer’s is an irreversible degeneration of the brain that robs its victims of memory, cognition and personality, and eventually leads to death. Some 500,000 new cases of Alzheimer's disease will be diagnosed in the United States this year, according to the website UsAgainstAlzheimer’s. The cost is enormous and getting worse. Total payments for health care, long-term care and hospice for people with Alzheimer's disease and other dementias are projected to increase from $259 billion in 2017 to more than $1 trillion in 2050, according to the BrightFocus Foundation. The late Dr. William Markesbery, founding director of the renowned Sanders-Brown Center on Aging at the University of Kentucky, had taken a keen interest in Sel-Plex. “This is something we have to work on,” Dr. Lyons recalls him saying. In 2009, Dr. Markesbery published the results of a study in which Sel-Plex was fed to a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease and significantly reduced the levels of amyloid plaques relative to groups of the same mice fed a normal diet. It is known that the hallmark pathologies of Alzheimer’s include the formation of amyloid plaques, abnormal clusters of protein fragments that build up between nerve cells in the brain, and tangles of dead and dying nerve cells made up of twisted strands of another protein called tau. Dr. Ronan Power, vice president of Alltech Life Sciences, recalled Dr. Markesbery’s excitement. “He said, ‘Hey, you guys have something here. Look at these results. I mean, this is extraordinary. This is a dramatic reduction in amyloid burden in these animals, and I’ve never seen anything quite like it before. We really need to pursue this.’” Soon after, Dr. Power began that pursuit, working with researchers such as Dr. Mark Lovell at the Sanders-Brown Center. “When we saw that this material might have an effect on pathways associated with Alzheimer’s disease, we went to the Food and Drug Administration and showed them what we had,” he said. “And they said, ‘Okay. You’ve got enough safety data here from registering Sel-Plex as an animal feed additive. We’ll allow you to do a Phase 1 trial.’” The Phase 1 trial examined safety by providing AT-001 to healthy, elderly human volunteers, while others in a control group received a placebo. All were monitored closely for any adverse effects. “We did that, and it came through with flying colors,” said Lovell. “We actually administered increasing doses of the material up to 800 milligrams per day, which is far in excess of the recommended daily allowance for selenium. And we saw no adverse effects whatsoever.” Additional measurements revealed that, in volunteers receiving the AT-001, markers of inflammation decreased dramatically. “Inflammation is one of the processes that’s thought to run in parallel with the development of Alzheimer’s disease, and inflammation may well exacerbate dementia progression as well,” said Power. There was more. Spinal fluid was drawn from the volunteer patients. “The spinal fluid is the same fluid that surrounds and bathes your brain,” explained Power. “It’s kind of a closed circuit. You can take a sample of spinal fluid, but you can’t exactly go into the brain and take a sample because that would be ultra-invasive. “So, looking at the spinal fluid and monitoring the level of amyloid protein, which can form the brain plaques that I was talking about — when we looked at the levels of amyloid protein in these volunteers at the start and at the finish, we saw that in the people receiving AT-001, the levels didn’t fluctuate at all,” he continued. “They were basically the same at the start as they were at the end. In the people receiving the sugar pill, we saw that the levels had dropped significantly.” Puzzled by these results, Dr. Power turned for answers to Dr. Gregory Jicha, the chief clinician and professor at the University of Kentucky’s, National Institute on Aging-funded Alzheimer’s disease center. “I said to Greg Jicha, ‘Well, heck, this is a bust, because this shows that the people who were getting the sugar pill actually did better because they have reduced levels of amyloid protein in their spinal fluid.’ And he said, ‘No, no. You’re wrong. If it’s reduced in the spinal fluid, you have to ask yourself, where has it gone? So, more than likely it's gone into the brain and formed clumps. Right?\" Reductions in amyloid levels in spinal fluid can be an indication that the amyloid has migrated into the brain and has clumped or “aggregated” into plaques, thus the decrease noted in spinal fluid. The unchanged levels of amyloid protein in the spinal fluid from the volunteers taking AT-001, on the other hand, potentially indicated that they had fewer amyloids migrating to the brain. The Alltech-Sanders-Brown team, led by Dr. Jicha and Dr. Ronan Murphy at Sanders-Brown, now has a Phase 2 trial of AT-001 underway involving 60 volunteers. “These are patients who are still healthy, but who may be at increased risk of eventually developing Alzheimer’s disease either because their parent(s) had Alzheimer’s disease or because they carry ApoE4, the only genetic marker that’s recognized to be associated with Alzheimer’s disease,” said Jicha. There will be a repeat of the spinal fluid measurement, and, this time, brain imaging is being employed. The researchers are looking at differences between those treated with AT-001 versus those on a placebo. “We’re looking at inflammatory markers in the brain and Alzheimer’s protein levels in the spinal fluid, the latter being one of the early signals that we got in our Phase 1 study. Those proteins continued to show trends consistent with moving toward advanced aging and increased risk for diseases like Alzheimer’s, and in the treated subjects, we saw that process slowed tremendously. So, now we’re looking to see if in a large population this is really true.” Alltech researchers are working to determine what is responsible for the cell death and tissue loss noted in the Alzheimer's brain. “We are trying to maintain the health of that part of the cell that becomes dysfunctional and sets off the cascade of events that eventually ends up in those structures (plaques and tangles) being formed, which in turn lead to brain decay, neurodegeneration and death,” said Dr. Power. Most of the current pipeline treatments for Alzheimer’s focus on antibodies targeted to the structures that are the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s disease, those amyloid plaques and the tangles, he explained. “You’re going to see a number of these pharmaceuticals coming onto the market, but they are going to treat the symptoms rather than the cause,” said Dr. Power. “I feel that the best chance is to try to track this disease back to the point at which it starts and try to nip it in the bud. Better yet, if you can help the situation with simple nutritional supplements rather than pharmaceuticals, that has got to be a good thing.” What about the federal regulatory obstacles in place to ensure that substances marketed to the public are as safe as their manufacturers claim? Dr. Jicha recalled when General Mills ran afoul with the FDA over a claim for one its top-selling breakfast cereals. “Cheerios was advertising that it would reduce your cholesterol and prevent heart attack and stroke,” he said. “Well, that automatically makes Cheerios a drug that needs to be regulated by the FDA, and perhaps your doctor might have to write you a prescription for your next bowl of Cheerios. So, we do need to be cautious about that as well.” Jicha cautioned against overstating implications. “The human studies that we have done to date have not focused on patients with Alzheimer’s disease,” he said. “We’re focusing on patients with risk for Alzheimer’s disease. And so, one should not confuse AT-001 with a medicine. This is not to treat a particular disease. This is a supplement to augment health and perhaps bolster resistance toward processes that could potentially lead to a variety of diseases in the future.” Dr. Power clarified the distinction. “AT-001 is a yeast product, and so, essentially, it is a plant or, as the supplement/nutraceutical industry would call it, a botanical,” said Dr. Power. A suitable analogy, he noted, might be cinchona tree bark and quinine, or foxglove and digitalis. Cinchona bark extract was used as a remedy for malaria as far back as the 1600s, but the active ingredient, quinine (a drug), was not identified until the 1800s. Likewise, foxglove extract was used for heart conditions in the 1700s, but digitalis, the active drug ingredient, was not isolated until 100 years later. “Based on the track record of other potential Alzheimer's treatments, waiting to register the active substance as a drug could take at least another eight years, many millions of dollars and no guarantees of approval.” But, said Dr. Power, \"Releasing AT-001 as a supplement allows people to perhaps get some of the benefits.\" Ultimately, however, if supported by clinical trials, the goal is to develop a single, pure compound that has been isolated from the scores of compounds present in the parent preparation, AT-001. Designated AT-002, this single compound has “very obvious effects on Alzheimer’s disease progression, based on studies in animal models of Alzheimer’s disease,” said Dr. Power. “If AT-002 makes it on to the market, it will be much more potent than AT-001 because it is the pure, concentrated active principle. And, we (or whoever brings it forward) will hopefully have the human data to make direct claims about its effect on Alzheimer’s disease.” In the meantime, the company is making the AT-001 supplement available through its Alltech Life Sciences division with a commitment to reinvest all net proceeds from its sale into programs to research and develop new products for human health applications.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/alzheimers-disease-search-hope","title":"\n\n                    Alzheimer's disease: The search for hope\n                    ","date":"September 15, 2017","contentLength":1810}},{"pageContent":"From the mythical tales of Pegasus and the Black Stallion to the true legacies of Alexander the Great’s Bucephalus and Man o’ War, few animals conjure up images of nobility, strength, beauty, power and freedom in our minds quite the same way a horse does. First domesticated 5,000 years ago in Europe and Asia, the role of the horse throughout history has changed considerably, and these beautiful animals have demonstrated an incredible range of abilities and athleticism. While some cultures still rely on horses for transportation or agriculture, others primarily view the relationship with the horse as one of sport or pleasure. Now a multibillion-dollar industry, the economic value of the business of horses is estimated to be $39 billion in the U.S. alone. Also evident are the opportunities to use new technology. While the progress of the past few years has been swift, the full potential hasn’t yet been realized. Eight digital technologies discussed in previous blogs have the potential to disrupt the equine industry, altering the very fundamentals of how we take care of horses. 3D printing: The new farrier? 3D printers can provide nontraditional answers to traditional challenges. Through improved breeding and nutrition, the horse industry has been able to dramatically improve performance, but challenges remain, specifically injuries and irregular growth patterns. 3D printing could be used to create casts, splints or possibly prosthetics for animals with injured or broken legs. For every Seabiscuit, there are countless examples of valuable horses that are put down when they break a bone. Previously, the prognosis for such horses was very poor, but what if 3D printing could step in as a solution? With this tool, veterinarians could print any number of things to solve myriad health issues. CSIRO in Australia has developed 3D horseshoe printing technology to generate horseshoes using imaging software that closely analyzes the hoof in order to provide shoes with a superior ergonomic fit. © Copyright CSIRO Australia, 2013 Robots: For heavy horse lifting Robotic technology is already replacing a host of repetitive tasks, particularly in manufacturing, and greatly reducing labor costs. In the horse industry, applications could actually save lives. Robots have the ability to lift a horse in a careful manner that controls weight distribution and reduces the risk of hurting horses in operations that could be life-threatening, such as broken legs or laminitis. One form of equine lift was designed through collaboration between the University of Saskatchewan and a machinery company called RMD Engineering, which had originally taken inspiration of the idea with people suffering from multiple sclerosis. Robots can also help in equine medicine and the evolution of CT scans. Each year, hundreds of horses are fatally injured in North America due to racetrack injuries, mainly fractures. Getting an accurate scan of an animal as large as a horse can prove quite challenging, but robotic devices, such as the one created by 4DDI Equine, maneuver around the horse, reducing the need for the animal’s cooperation as well as providing a safer alternative to more traditional methods that may have involved heavier sedation, tranquilization or other anesthetics. Equimagine can scan the entire horse in 90 seconds, taking over 900 images and producing high-quality, multi-planar 3D (or even 4D!) images, all while the horse is awake and standing.

Their value is already well established in many areas of agriculture, such as monitoring crop growth and disease, but the role drones can play with horses has yet to be fully explored. The Bureau of Land Management could potentially use drones to monitor the population and movements of wild horses, without the requirement for helicopters or trackers, both of which pose their own challenges and limitations. It is also possible to imagine a future in which they could be used to deliver vaccines, antibiotics or other medical needs to veterinarians treating wild horses. At a more micro level, drones supplied with a camera, combined with machine vision, could be used to monitor the movement of a cantering or galloping horse in open spaces and to determine lameness or other idiosyncrasies not normally visible to the human observer. Despite these positive applications, it is worth mentioning the concerns most horse people have with drones. They are, effectively, large horseflies that can cause fear, and possibly even harm, to horses that can be easily frightened by the loud hum, if not the hovering object in the sky. Death or injury of spooked horses has been reported on several occasions. Given that drones are still a relatively uncommon sight to humans, it is not likely that training for compatibility between horses and this technology will become standard. Sensors: From smart saddles to dressage scripts Sensors have already established their position as a new powerful technology for horse management. They can be used to analyze many aspects of performance and health, and already over 80 companies provide wearable sensor technology for horses. The capabilities of this modern technology can help veterinarians and the equine industry immensely. Seaver, for instance, is a wearable girth that measures a horse’s heart and breathing rate and uses algorithms to determine the animal’s movement when jumping to provide measurable data regarding its vertical and horizontal aspects. This is accessible via the rider’s smartphone app and can be stored and played back later for riders to assess the horse’s movement, path or strides. When repeated, it can determine changes over time. Arioneo has designed a wearable that attaches to a blanket and monitors a horse at rest. Well-known saddle maker Voltaire has developed the first smart saddle. The Blue Wing saddle is the first of its kind that is designed to actually benefit the horse while in use by collecting information and saving that information for review later by the rider. It does this using a chip in the saddle that collects information about each ride: time spent in each gait, direction, quality of the horse’s symmetry, number of jumps, etc. All of this can be reviewed later by the rider or trainer; adjustments to the training program can be made based on evaluation of the horse’s performance using these metrics. Photo Credit: Image courtesy of Voltaire Saddlery. Another smart, wearable gadget is the Nightwatch Smart Halter by Protequus, which uses microprocessors and sensors to provide 24-hour monitoring. If a horse is in distress, Nightwatch can send text messages or phone calls to the recipient. For sport and riding horses, GaitSmart Pegasus is a wearable designed to analyze a horse’s movements and produces a report within minutes. Sensors may soon find their way into the dressage arena. Lemberg, a mobile and web development company, is attempting to use sensor technology to determine a rider’s location in the ring and give directions, or a “script,” to the rider as he or she performs the exercise. The company is testing different location technologies such as Xiaomi Mi4 or Apple’s iBeacons. Both offer location positioning technology without the use of satellites, thereby offering greater accuracy, which is necessary given that the arena is often covered and comparatively small, and the directions in dressage competition need to be extremely accurate and perfectly timed. Another incredible advancement in sensor technology is a high-tech “camera pill” that allows veterinarians to see directly into the gut of the animal, thereby allowing for better diagnosis of disease, general health status or examination of surgical sites. Other tech companies producing equine sensors include SeeHorse, Equisense, EquinITy, Connected.Horse and HorseCom. These technologies offer owners insight into the daily health and well-being of their horse using real-time data. Potentially, this information could give veterinarians the opportunity to analyze and interpret massive amounts of information regarding both individual animals, and, if used collectively, to better understand the species as a whole. Artificial intelligence (AI): More accurate training? AI is the ability to gather information from sources, such as sensors or other data collection devices, and interpret that data to help make meaningful and logical decisions. AI eliminates interpretational errors by allowing for analysis of significantly larger data sets, thereby eliminating many mistakes that might occur with humans. Equimetre is an AI-powered wearable offering insight to trainers in the horse racing industry by providing analysis of the animal while also collecting data about the conditions of the track, temperature, humidity, etc. In evaluating all of this data through AI, the company is able to provide analyses and recommendations to trainers that will best suit the horse. This technology could easily be transferred into other disciplines in the industry, including jumping, dressage, endurance or polo, or it could be used to make recommendations for racetrack betting, grossly altering the odds! Such was the case when CBS Interactive challenged Unanimous A.I. to predict a winner of the 2016 Kentucky Derby. When combined with something like machine vision (such as the company Cainthus provides to dairy), it could provide insights into the daily routine and management of horses. These technologies can result in more accurate training and better health assessment by generating appropriate regimens for horses, riders and trainers. Augmented reality (AR): Imagine viewing races and seeing the speeds of each horse Augmented reality is a combination of real-world visuals supplemented with information created from external data. The augmented portion of the image is provided by digital information interpreting light frequencies not visible to the human eye. The added visuals can be imposed on the real image in such a way that they are indistinguishable. Equine thermography, for example, uses a camera that detects infrared waves on the horse’s body surface that are invisible to the human eye. Veterinary Thermal Imaging, Ltd. uses this same information to detect issues in horses’ backs, ligaments and tendons, muscles, bones and nerves, often weeks before the animal is even showing signs of pain or injury, allowing for the opportunity to preventatively treat the animal. Photo credit: Image courtesy of Inspiritus Equine, Inc. The Equine Motion Analysis System is a software technology company that examines horse and rider symmetry. Designed by a computer programmer and equitation scientist, the program is designed to create an image depicting where a horse, rider and saddle are properly (or improperly) aligned. Additionally, the future of horse racing betting could easily benefit from this type of technology. Using AR, bettors could more easily see what is happening on the track through the use of devices such as goggles; real vision could be supplemented with additional information such as speed, placement, and market or betting information. From a trainer’s perspective, more detailed information regarding the individual horse could be provided, thereby giving insight into the animal’s health status in real time. AR’s expense could be offset by the creation of new betting mechanisms. Companies like YantramStudio, Meta and Vuzix are the likely future of AR, and their use could be replicated in the equine industry. Virtual reality (VR): A new way for vets to train Virtual reality provides a new tool for veterinarians and those training to work with horses. Complicated or rare surgeries could be practiced in a classroom ad libitum, minimizing the risk to students, technicians and teachers. Although expensive, VR has the ability to greatly reduce other costs, such as time and energy, as well as save an animal from enduring invasive procedures for the purpose of learning and training. As VR becomes more common and less expensive, it could be used in more mundane training for managers and workers. It could also be used for equestrian-related entertainment. William Hill unveiled its latest horseracing prototype called “Get in the Race,” in which users can experience a live horse race (from the back of the horse!) in a 3D virtual environment. Unit9 has developed a polo playing experience using software such as Google Cardboard. If more companies such as Oculus Rift choose to get in the game, the potential for cost savings to users could greatly increase. Blockchain: A secure, global network of horse information Blockchain technology is possibly one of the most universally beneficial technologies transforming business today. Blockchain is a database of information contained across a network that uses a decentralized system of information management, thereby making it difficult to corrupt the information. It is basically a database where digital records can be stored by anyone, and security is guaranteed. It is public and transparent because all the information is embedded within a distributed network. Historically, blockchain has been used primarily in the financial industry, but it can be applied to business. An individual company or user doesn’t need to understand how to manage it, but only how to use it. In the equine industry, blockchain allows buyers from all over the world to store valuable and trustworthy information about horses, prices, treatments, scientific studies, feeding and technology, etc. Essentially, any equine company can access the database and register anything about horses such as birth, surgery, injections, veterinary visits, injuries, height and weight, treatments and more. Increasingly, more federations are requiring microchipping in horses, including the United States Equestrian Federation and The Jockey Club. Microchip manufacturers are benefiting from this, but so will prospective horse owners, veterinarians and anyone else interested in learning more information about a specific animal if this information is also housed using blockchain technology. Roping it all together The old business models are being disrupted with these eight technologies. Combined, they can be part of the internet of things (IoT), a system in which everything is connected and sourceable. GMAX is already using IoT technology to connect various equine technologies and provide incredible amounts of data, interpretation, analysis and recommendations to users. Such applications can be transformative to the equine industry. EquInnolab provides educational opportunities for learning and collaboration involving these technologies within the equine industry. Not since the invention of the saddle and stirrup have horse people had so many opportunities to reimagine the future. These technological changes are only the beginning.

These innovative technologies have the potential to change the way we (and our animals) live and cope with illnesses and devastating diseases such as cancer. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a new cancer treatment called CAR T cell therapy. CAR T stands for “chimeric antigen receptor T cell.” T cells harness the body’s immune system to fight cancer cells. The thought behind CAR T is to use a patient's own immune system T cells and engineer them in such a way that the T cells can better recognize cancer cells and neutralize them without damaging organs or causing harm to the individual. The National Cancer Institute website provides excellent information on targeted cancer therapies. Most of these therapies focus on drugs (ones that are already approved to treat specific types of cancer or are in development) that utilize an individual’s unique genes to treat the disease. Would it be possible to use the information on a person’s or animal’s genes to identify whether the individual may be predisposed to develop a devastating disease such as cancer? And would it be possible to use such information to prevent the onset of such a disease? Last year alone, it was estimated that some 1.6 million Americans would be diagnosed with cancer. The key is to understand what drives cancer and its different forms, what genes are involved and how we can downregulate (“turn off”) their expression. There are already several studies taking place, and research is ongoing in the field of animal nutrition, demonstrating the impact that nutrients have on gene expression and how such expression affects performance and health. As work continues to expand in this field and into human and companion animal nutrition, we may be able to design diets based on the genetic makeup of a person or animal. This is a game changer. Imagine providing diets that will feed the unique genes, provide a healthy life, and reduce or delay the onset of disease. Once we understand what an individual’s gene requirement is for certain nutrients such as selenium, zinc or a fatty acid, precise nutrition could provide an optimized diet that’s just right for their body’s needs.

In fact, this sea louse is the reason your salmon dinner is weighing heavy on your grocery bill. Market prices of farmed salmon have been reaching historic highs. The tiny crustaceans, commonly known as sea lice, that feed on the mucous, skin and blood of the fish are a fascinating challenge for the aquaculture researcher but the bane of the producer’s existence. With the world market for salmon estimated at $10.7 billion annually (IntraFish), salmon farmers in the major producing countries, such as Norway, Scotland, Canada and Chile, are racing to fight infestations of the damaging ectoparasites. Marine Harvest of Norway, the world’s leading farmed salmon producer, reports the biological costs of harvested fish in the second quarter of 2017 were 16 percent higher compared to the second quarter of 2016, according to Undercurrent News. Marine Harvest has reported that its health-related production costs remain near record levels. Most of those costs are attributed to mortality and sea lice mitigation. Sea lice infections are natural phenomenon among wild Atlantic salmon. What’s relatively new is the introduction of large-scale fish farms — essentially enormous sea cages — tucked into sheltered areas along coastlines. The trouble begins when wild lice-bearing salmon swim nearby. “These natural populations of lice, whose juvenile stages drift with the current and attach to the salmon, are also brought to our shores on the backs of wild populations of salmon from their North Atlantic feeding grounds,” said John Sweetman, Alltech international projects manager for aqua. “As they come into the estuaries and bay areas to prepare themselves to go upriver and they meet lower salinity water, the sea lice, intolerant of freshwater, become detached from the fish.” In those semi-saline conditions, the lingering juvenile sea lice become infectious agents preying on nearby caged salmon. The population density of these caged cultures allows the parasite to spread quickly and even contaminate the wild salmon population. “Sea lice cause physical damage,” said Sweetman. “Physical damage in the skin of the animal allows opportunistic pathogens to penetrate the skin. So, you have opportunistic bacterial pathogens entering through the damage and disruptions in the membranes and barrier structures of the skin.” The result is a deadly cocktail of ailments: decline in disease resistance; edema; cellular inflammation; hyperplasia; epithelial shedding; hemorrhaging; mucus discharge; osmoregulatory stress; and decreased appetite. Marine Harvest has watched feed conversion ratios decline due to reduced feeding appetite following biological issues. The resulting annual losses to salmon farmers in Norway alone now exceed €500 million. Searching for a sea lice solution A process of elimination has been underway in the search for solutions that satisfy production economics balanced against consumer demand for food source transparency and safety. No current strategies provide complete protection; few surpass 50 percent protection, according to Dr. Karl Dawson, vice president and chief scientific officer at Alltech. Mitigation approaches have included emamectin benzoate. Introduced in 2000 and marketed as SLICE®, the antimicrobial is fed to salmon, poisoning any sea lice nibbling on the tissue of the fish. “But in recent years, a resistance has been developing, so today’s effective dose is about five times what it used to be and continues to increase,” Dawson stated in a presentation at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference 2017. Hydrogen peroxide baths were once popular among Norwegian salmon producers until food safety regulators raised concerns. Thermolicers, another approach, plunge the salmon through heated water that kills sea lice, but also can damage the fish. Other strategies, such as sea bath treatments, can be highly disruptive to salmon farms. Once-promising pharmaceutical treatments have become less effective as drug resistance has developed. Today, producers are looking to holistic management programs to battle sea lice. In Norway, those mitigation costs pile on top of production expenses resulting from heavy regulation. “We’re talking about an average 0.5 lice per fish as the upper limit before a treatment has to be undertaken in a region to reduce lice burdens on the fish,” said Sweetman. New facilities being built in Norway are designed to hold fish longer before being transferred to sea cages. The idea is to reduce the amount of time the salmon spend in the sea, exposed to sea lice. In 2016, Chile, another of the world’s major producers of Atlantic salmon, became the first country to approve an in-feed treatment formulated by Elanco. Studies are said to show that the treatment inhibits the formation of chitin in sea lice, preventing the lice from developing into adults. Fish treated with the medication are now accepted for trade with many major export markets, including the United States, European Union, Japan and Brazil, according to SeafoodSource.com. A non-pharma option in the arsenal against sea lice Led by Dawson and Dr. Keith Filer, research coordinator for aquaculture at Alltech’s Kentucky facility, Alltech and its research partners are investigating a novel approach inspired by work with a specific mannan-rich cell wall fraction (MRF) in other animals. “The interest in using this material originally came from studies in chickens that indicated that early life exposure to the mannan-rich fraction improved the innate immunity of chickens,” said Dawson. The Alltech scientists believe this innate immunity is critical to developing resistance to ectoparasites like sea lice. It is the basis for current efforts by Dawson, Filer and their team to expose young fish to the fraction early in life. The MRF is a carbohydrate derived from the outer cell of a specific strain of yeast — Saccharomyces cerevisiae 1062 — using a proprietary process developed by Alltech. Its use as a feed supplement in terrestrial animals has been well-documented in more than 500 trials and numerous peer-reviewed papers, and recently its effectiveness in aquaculture has been established, according to an International Aquafeed article on gut morphology that Sweetman co-authored with Arkadios Dimitroglou, Simon Davies and Silvia Torrecillas. The researchers reported that the MRF “not only improves the gastrointestinal morphology and therefore its function through an increased absorptive surface and better absorptive capability but also interacts with the immune system in a modulatory manner and alters enzymes. The combination of all these benefits results in better performance, livability and optimum immune response and therefore gives a more cost-effective production of interest to the commercial producer.” As salmon begin to mature, they adapt for life in salt water in an intermediary stage known as smolting, which Filer sees an opportune time for priming their immune system by exposure to novel feed ingredients. “The mucous system of the fish is considered a portion of their innate immunity,” he explained. “So, it would enhance their mucous production, and then when they’re put out to sea, it would enable them to be able to fight those ectoparasites.” “That was extremely interesting for us in the aquaculture industry, because the mucus associated with the gut is a key component of the innate immune system,” said Sweetman, whose original work got underway in the Mediterranean in 2004 with an initial trial among salmon, sea bass and bream. “A fish is exposed to the environment, and the first point of contact of the environment is on the mucosal layer, the skin, the gills and the gut of the fish,” he said. “That’s where opportunistic pathogens and other insults are derived from water. So, if we can improve the mucosal status and the gut structure associated with poultry, we should be able to do it with fish.” Alltech is currently supplying an MRF product to the Norwegian salmon industry. When used as a feed supplement, it has been shown to increase external mucous production on the surface of the fish, which improves overall innate immunity and disease resistance of the fish. Active supplementation has reduced sea lice infections by up to 57 percent, according to Sweetman. This is a novel approach for nutritionally enhancing disease resistance and controlling the pesky sea lice. \"In looking to the future, the industry will have an additional tool in the arsenal to improve the resistance of salmon to sea lice infections,\" said Dawson. \"This tool will be a centerpiece of advanced control mechanisms as new and more effective ways of administering the supplements become available.\" I want to learn more about aquaculture nutrition.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/salmons-sake-seeking-solutions-sea-lice","title":"\n\n                    For salmon’s sake: Seeking solutions to sea lice\n                    ","date":"September 17, 2017","contentLength":1405}},{"pageContent":"Mineral needs in modern dairy diets Most dairy research tends to focus on protein and energy needs, and minerals are often overlooked. Yet, when we fail to consider the role of minerals, problems can arise, including interferences or interactions with minerals in feed and water. Mineral types Zinc: Essential to more than 200 enzyme systems at work in the animal, such as carbohydrate and energy metabolism, protein synthesis, nucleic acid metabolism, epithelial integrity, cell repair and division and utilization of vitamins A and E Needed for development/function of the immune system and critical to the cellular function of cells, including heterophils, basophils, macrophages and T-lymphocytes Essential in wound healing Critical to reproduction because of its involvement in sexual maturity, reproductive capacity and semen quality Copper Component of immune system enzymes Necessary to increase structural health and elasticity of connective tissue and blood vessels as well as increase strength of bone Needed for metabolism of iron and maturation of red blood cells Manganese Cofactor for enzymes in the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, proteins and nucleic acids Essential for normal brain function Involved in the formation of collagen, bone growth, urea formation, fatty acid synthesis, cholesterol synthesis and protein digestion Important for proper immune function and wound healing Selenium Critical to proper enzyme function and cellular antioxidant systems Involved in muscle contraction and immune functions Important for reproduction Form defines function Understanding the difference between organic and inorganic minerals is important. When we look closely at organic minerals, or minerals with a carbon structure such as Bioplex®, they are in the same form that we would find in corn, grain or forages. In other words, they are similar to the minerals stored in plants. Bioplex minerals are produced by replicating plant material in a patented manufacturing process, which chelates the minerals onto amino acids and peptides. Bioplex and Sel-Plex® trace minerals provide mineral nutrition in the forms most similar to those present naturally in food and feed ingredients. Why not just supplement with more inorganics? There are various issues that can arise when using inorganic minerals due to their lower biological activity, including associated environmental concerns. Various research studies have demonstrated that over-fortification of trace minerals can elevate antibiotic resistance in swine operations as bacteria like Salmonella develop tolerance to high levels of copper and zinc. Inorganic minerals can have various mineral interactions, and they can serve as antagonists that can interfere with normal biological processes. Examples include: High levels of calcium and phosphorus can reduce manganese utilization by up to 65 percent (Wedekind and Baker, 1990; Baker and Oduho, 1994). Excess manganese itself impairs utilization of iron (Baker and Halpin, 1991). Excess zinc has an antagonistic effect on copper and manganese (Vohra and Heil, 1969). Total replacement in dairy heifers: The research support behind Bioplex When comparing supplementing Bioplex minerals to sulfate forms of minerals in a study done by Pino and Heinrichs, published in the 2016 Journal of Dairy Science, Bioplex diets included fewer trace minerals yet showed an increase in total volatile fatty acid and butyrate concentrations, due to an acceleration of rumen organism replication. The dairy heifers also spent less time eating, indicating that Bioplex minerals had improved palatability. There are other examples of Bioplex’s effect: In 1993, a study done in Missouri determined that Bioplex Zn® supplemented at 800 milligrams per day led to a reduction in the number of new mastitis infections. In 2007, a study done by Kinal showed that Bioplex trace minerals reduced somatic cell counts, and the same study showed that there was more milk produced in the first 60 days of lactation when using Bioplex. A study done by Scaletti and Harmon in 2012 showed a reduction in E. coli levels in milk as well as an increase in milk production. The research support behind Sel-Plex In a study done by Silvestre and Thatcher in 2006, cows supplemented with Sel-Plex showed improvements in immune function, adaptive immunity, cervical discharge scores and pregnancy rates. The adage that “form defines function,” especially when it comes to minerals, is both important and true.

The most common symptoms of a Salmonella infection are diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps. Although illness from Salmonella can be the result of multiple factors, including improper food preparation, poultry producers can help reduce the risk to consumers through good farm practices. Potential sources of bacterial contamination: Wild birds/pests (e.g., beetles, flies, rodents) Water Visitors Human personnel’s hygiene In poultry production, there are eight areas that require attention in order to reduce bad bacterial contamination on-farm and aid in the prevention of Salmonella. 1. Cleaning and hygiene Residual contamination from previous flocks is a common reason for Salmonella-positive birds. Cleaning growing houses between flocks can significantly reduce the prevalence of Salmonella in live production. Effective biosecurity and pest control are also key to avoiding contamination. 2. Feed Contaminated grains and feed ingredients can increase the risk of Salmonella in the final feed. Use heat-pelleted feed and source feed from mills operating with stringent quality standards. 3. Water management Water management is a crucial part of any Salmonella control program in poultry, since water can serve as a medium for the organism to spread from bird to bird. Chlorinated water and the use of organic acids in the water have been shown to reduce Salmonella levels in the flock. 4. Dust Dust can also be a medium for Salmonella to spread. A system that keeps dust levels below 3 milligrams per cubic meter is an important prevention tool. 5. Litter management Poultry litter with high moisture and pH levels allows Salmonella to thrive. Managing the moisture and pH of the litter has been shown to be an effective way to control Salmonella in live poultry production. 6. Managing gut flora Establishing and maintaining proper gut flora soon after hatching is very important to prevent Salmonella from colonizing birds. Programs that include the use of probiotics, organic acids, enzymes and yeast technologies have been shown to be effective at maintaining optimal gut health. 7. Coccidiosis Intestinal challenges caused by poor gastrointestinal integrity can have a big impact on Salmonella levels in broilers. Strong cocci management needs to be part of every Salmonella control program. 8. Vaccination The use of vaccines, especially at the breeder level, has the potential to reduce the prevalence of Salmonella among day-old chicks.

In the thousands of years since, the effect of nutrition on health has gained a whole new perspective through a scientific area of study called “nutrigenomics.” What is nutrigenomics? Your pet’s genome consists of all of its genetic material, or DNA. It provides the basic information for your pet’s life. You can think of it as a blueprint, providing carefully drawn out plans for your pet’s healthy life. However, outside influences, such as the environment and nutrition, can have a strong impact on the expression of this genetic information, or essentially how that blueprint is read. The canine and feline genome sequences were first reported in 2005 and 2007, respectively. These breakthroughs opened the door for cutting-edge research approaches to understand the molecular mechanisms behind everyday life. While knowing the DNA sequence of a genome is an essential first step, the real breakthroughs come from understanding how each of the genes in that sequence responds to outside influences and how this relates to health and disease. By up-regulating (“turning on”) or down-regulating (“turning off”) genes, the body changes the levels of the proteins that make up structures and functions in the cells. This, in turn, alters physiological processes like energy production or immune response. Nutrigenomics is the field of research we use to study if changes in genes occur with changes in the animal’s diet. By understanding nutritional influences on the genome, we can understand how these responses impact animal health. Using DNA microarrays, the basis for nutrigenomic studies, allows researchers to evaluate the activity of thousands of genes at a time. These studies provide us with new tools for understanding how nutrients precisely work, why different forms of nutrients have different effects and how such nutrients can be optimized for health. Nutrigenomics is disrupting the classical view of animal nutrition, allowing us to look at “you are what you eat” in a whole new light. How can we use nutrigenomics in pet nutrition? A vast amount of data is generated from nutrigenomic studies. From a single experiment, we find out how thousands of genes respond to a diet change. This slew of information can help elucidate the complex interactions between nutrition, an individual animal’s genetic code, and the onset or prevention of diseases and disorders. By considering these aspects of nutrient-gene interactions, we can ultimately design diets for the treatment or prevention of specific diseases. For instance, if we can understand the molecular changes that occur prior to the onset of joint inflammation and arthritis, we can potentially use nutrition to diminish these changes and prevent this disorder. Nutrigenomics can also help us focus on the area of “precision nutrition.” This is especially important when considering the unique nutritional challenges of different breeds and life stages of pets. For instance, if a breed of dog is predisposed to a disease like obesity, researchers can use genomics to determine what changes occur in gene activity with the onset of disease. They can then test different diets to see what nutritional strategies can prevent these changes in gene expression. Even further, we can use nutrigenomics to identify the unique nutrient requirements of different breeds, life stages or activity levels of pets. We can then use the information gathered to design appropriate and precise diets to these specific aspects, which will help ensure our pets experience optimal health and well-being. Is this the future of nutrition? The more we understand about nutrition, the more we can use it in the way Hippocrates envisioned, as a tool to fight disease and maintain good health. While the idea of personalized nutrition for pets is still a long way off, research in the field of nutrigenomics makes steps toward this ultimate goal every day. Even more important is that every bit of data generated in this quest helps us feed our pets better and make steps toward optimal health through nutrition.

Dr. Shelby Roberts, postdoctoral research fellow in Alltech’s beef nutrition research department, shares her tips on scours prevention in your calves this season. 1. Stop calf scours early Early detection of scours is essential so that fluids and electrolytes can be restored in order to correct dehydration as soon as possible. Some common symptoms associated with scours include depression, weak suckling reflex, dehydration (sunken eyes) and abnormal breathing. 2. Manage your herd to minimize risk Manage your cow herd to minimize calf exposure to pathogens and stress. For example, try to keep calving areas as clean as possible to reduce the calves’ pathogen exposure. If possible, isolate sick calves and their dams from the cow herd to prevent the spread of the pathogen. 3. Manage nutrient requirements for mother cows Make sure the dams’ nutritional requirements are being met. Colostrum quality and quantity can be negatively affected by inadequate dam nutrition. Remember, when managing your fall calving herd: Fall calving cows will be lactating throughout the winter, so they will have higher nutritional requirements compared to spring calvers. 4. Use the fecal scoring guide Check your fecal score using the guide below. If you have a fecal score of less than 2.5 for more than five days, your calves have a problem. % diarrhea = Total number of calves with a fecal score of “4” x 100 / Number of calves in pen Duration of diarrhea = Total days from weaning in which calves exhibit a fecal score of “4” Have a question or comment?","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/4-tips-stopping-calf-scours","title":"\n\n                    4 tips for stopping calf scours\n                    ","date":"September 25, 2017","contentLength":268}},{"pageContent":"Calf care is key to the profitability and longevity of a herd. When it comes to attention to detail and calf health management, there are few better than White Rock Farms in Peachland, North Carolina. Owned and operated by Roddy Purser, White Rock Farms of Peachland, North Carolina, includes a 600-head Jersey dairy farm, hog houses and a layer operation. An innovative first-generation dairyman, Roddy saw opportunity in the dairy industry, and he knew that the secret to success was putting together a capable team equipped with both passion for the industry and the knowledge to build a successful herd. Dakota Sparks is one of those team members. She is in charge when it comes to managing calves at White Rock Farms. Drew Gibson and Dakota Sparks, herd managers at White Rock Farms Dakota has helped White Rock Farms to maintain a less than 1 percent death loss on the farm since the beginning in 2014. She attributes this astounding success to four key elements: an employee dedicated to calves, cleanliness, a prevention approach and no cutting corners. How White Rock Farms has kept their calf death loss to less than 1% since 2014 1. An employee dedicated to calves Dedicating an employee to calves can be difficult for many farms, but as a farm grows, it becomes even more important. Dakota is the manager of White Rock Farms’ calf area, a responsibility she takes very seriously. Feeding calves twice a day starts with the White Rock Farms’ team removing water buckets and replacing them with milk buckets. This gives employees the opportunity to check calves while emptying, cleaning and refreshing water. These opportunities to observe calves are important for identifying any illnesses or abnormalities, so Dakota and her team devote their full attention to the task. 2. Cleanliness Once utilized, every hutch is cleaned. All sand and gravel are removed, and the hutch is kept vacant for one to two weeks. Once ready for a new resident, Dakota’s team utilizes a layer of black cloth at the bottom to keep the sand from falling through and then adds new gravel. This attention to detail reduces disease transmission from one calf to another, giving newborn calves the best possible opportunity for a healthy start. Not only are the hutches cleaned and sanitized after each calf, but calf buckets are sanitized after each feeding. After the calves are fed milk, their buckets are cleaned in a three-stage process: The first water bath includes 125°F water with soap. The second bath contains 145°F water with soap. The third and final bath holds cold, chlorinated water. Buckets are then stacked to air dry before the next feeding. 3. Prevention approach Antibiotics are used only in instances of severe illness, but are rarely needed, according to Dakota. By taking a preventative approach, the need for therapeutic treatment is minimized. White Rock Farms pasteurizes all colostrum and milk that is fed to calves and frequently utilizes electrolytes in water to help give calves a little boost. Dakota remarks that, when used properly, there can be substantial cost savings to pasteurizing milk for calves, especially once the cost of the pasteurizer is recouped (which occurred in two years for White Rock Farms). 4. No cutting corners All colostrum is tested. This test is to identify the quality of the colostrum based on IgG antibody levels in the milk. If it meets the requirements, it is then used, refrigerated or frozen if not utilized within 24 hours. The frozen containers are organized and marked with the necessary information to enable easy retrieval of bags. Roddy is confident the extra investments are worthwhile, as evidenced by heifers that are outperforming their mothers. With a solid foundation of nutrition, their calves have a healthy jumpstart on reaching breeding age with minimal illness.

I know the milking routine is very important in all dairy operations, because a lot of milk can either be gained or lost in the parlor. When I go into a parlor, I look for what I call “cowsistency.” I like to see the milking technicians following the same milking routine between milkings, between sessions and between months. We want all the technicians doing the same routine calmly and consistently, because the milking routine is so important to the quality of the milk produced and the safety of the dairy herd. Brushing One of the first things that we talk about when assessing a milking routine — and a lot of people miss this — is brushing. When the cows come in and we get ready to prep them, brushing should be one of the first things done, to get sand or soil off the teats. I am often called to a dairy because the cows are “dancing” while they are being milked. This is partially because the technicians have left the sand on and covered it in pre-dip solution, and then they are unable to wipe the sand off completely when it is wet. One of the most important things you can do in your routine is get a dry towel and brush gently, to remove sand and soil from the cow’s teats, prior to doing anything else. Forestripping The next step we like to do is called forestripping. The goal should be to get two to three squirts out of each teat. This is important to the milking routine because it releases a powerful let-down hormone and makes the cow think that her calf is there. Forestripping also gives us the opportunity to check the milk to see if there are any abnormalities about it. Additionally, those first few squirts of milk will give a good indication of whether a cow has mastitis. Another important part of forestripping is from a milk quality standpoint, because those first few squirts of milk are high in somatic cells, so we can lower the somatic cell count of the milk just by forestripping prior to milking. Pre-dip Another vital aspect to the milking routine is the pre-dip. In this step, we want to completely cover the teats with a pre-dip solution to adequately kill bacteria on the outside of the teats. When the milking technicians come back through the second time, make sure that dry, clean towels are used with a downward circular motion technique. Also, as a follow-up to this step in the milking process, be sure to flip the towel over and use it to clean the teat ends. Getting the teat ends clean is very important to decreasing the environmental challenges that can lead to mastitis, and to keeping the cows and the milk safe from harmful bacteria. Attachment and post-dip Once we get the cows cleaned and prepped, we come back and attach the unit squarely at the base of the udder so that we milk all quarters out correctly. At the conclusion of milking, once the units are detached, we come back with a high quality post-dip, making sure to gently but completely dip the teats, submerging them over the point where the film of milk ends. If we don’t do an adequate job and only get part of the teats in a post-dip, all the milk remaining is an organic load, making food for bacteria. Milking claw The milking claw is vital in our milking routine, because it gets the milk from the teat to the tank. One of the things I look at on the milking unit is whether the liner in the shell is lined up straight in relation to the outer shell. If the liner is twisted, we cannot adequately milk out that quarter. Another very important portion of the claw to look at is the hose support. How well are we supporting the claw in relation to the square base of the udder? Have a question?

But eggs are not only a great (and inexpensive!) source of protein; they have a high nutrient density, because they provide a number of nutrients in proportion to their calorie count. One egg has 13 essential vitamins and minerals in varying amounts, high-quality protein and antioxidants, all for just 70 calories.1 Additionally, the enrichment of eggs has made it possible for consumers to get even more nutrition from each egg. Producers have begun increasing key nutrients — like selenium — in layer diets in order to increase the nutrient content of eggs. By increasing the amount of this essential mineral in the layer diet, farmers have the opportunity to naturally increase the nutritional value of the eggs that they produce. What does this mean for consumers? Selenium is nutritionally essential for humans — it plays a role in healthy reproduction and metabolism and may help maintain a strong immune system.2-6 Selenium is also being studied for its potential role in reducing both the risk of cardiovascular disease and age-related decline in brain function. 8-10 Selenium-enriched eggs can help to fill the “nutritional gap” in our diets, delivering this essential nutrient through a food that’s delicious, inexpensive, readily accessible and easy to prepare. Sel-Plex® is Alltech's proprietary organic form of selenium yeast and is the first European Union-approved and only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-reviewed form of organic selenium. Sel-Plex is supported by more than 19 years of research and is now being used to enrich layer diets. References: Egg Nutrition Center of the American Egg Board 2017 Sunde RA. Selenium.

Did you know that there is an immersive game, developed by Giants Software of Switzerland, called Farming Simulator? The game allows players to armchair farm in the comfort of their living room. My curiosity was piqued when I heard about it, so I called Brian Bolger, an Irish engineer working in New York who contributes modifications to the game in his spare time, to learn more about it. I admitted to Brian that I knew very little about the game and was interested in its origins and what it was all about. Brian first discovered the game himself on YouTube and by the end of 2015 was actively involved in creating his own model. Farming Simulator gives players a complete farming experience. The game enables players to get a sense of what it’s like to toil the land, work with heavy machinery, harvest crops and care for livestock, all on their very own digital farm. Originally from County Kildare, a mere 25-minute drive from KEENAN headquarters in Borris, County Carlow, Brian develops game assets for Giants Software as a hobby. With a background in farming and a huge interest in farm machinery, Brian started out drawing basic shapes, making cubes and working his way up to building a small trailer. He progressed to developing more complex machines and discovered that Giants Software hosted an annual contest for the development of games assets — something that inspired Brian. “I enjoy the complexity of developing 3D models in 1:1, or full size, scale,” he said. “Developing a KEENAN model with the same functionality as the real machine is challenging, and I love it.” Brian gets into the weeds with the actual detail of the models he creates. From creating textures and colors for the 3D model through to digital controls, a model such as the KEENAN diet feeder can take Brian a couple of days to build from the ground up. Brian refers to himself as a “modder” (for those of us non-gamers, that refers to people who create modifications for games). Farming Simulator did not have a KEENAN machine a few years ago, and so Brian set about to rectify this. “I took pictures originally and built the model, adding functionality such as the feed mixing inside the wagon and the finished mix being poured out to feed the animals,” he explained. “I then created specifications for each of the effects and developed software to make it all work and come to life. It’s fairly complex, and there is no book on how to do it, but I really enjoy it.” Today, thanks to Brian’s ingenuity, the KEENAN “Green Machine” has more than 1 million downloads. The download numbers also spiked due to the game being available for console play on Xbox and PlayStation. “A lot of gamers are sons and daughters of farmers,” he said. “Interestingly enough, I get a lot of emails from people in the U.S. asking, ‘Where is this machine made?’” Farming Simulator has been on the market since 2008. However, it has experienced significant growth in the past two to three years. So popular is the simulator that Giants Software is now developing a South American version of the game. Brian estimates that the game player demographics are made up of approximately 70 percent of players aged 18 years old and under, with the remaining 30 percent being over age 18. It’s interesting to consider that many of our future farmers could be cutting their teeth and developing machine preferences through a digital platform. Why is Farming Simulator so popular? Brian is convinced it is all about the magic of creating your own machine for the games, the fact that it has no limits and the seemingly real immersion the user gets from farming in this manner. Farming Simulator is available to buy online. Go forth, gamers, and farm!","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/immersive-gaming-goes-farm","title":"\n\n                    Immersive gaming goes on-farm\n                    ","date":"March 1, 2018","contentLength":671}},{"pageContent":"Meet Dan Olson.

With this being my fourth year in attendance, one might believe I’ve become a master at preparing for the event. Quite the opposite. Dr. Pearse Lyons, the mastermind behind Alltech, is intricately involved in all events. His mind is a constant place of creativeness, innovation and disruption. I’ve yet to experience an event that did not bypass my expectations. The best method of preparation is to enter with an open mind. This year’s event challenged my open mind. It provoked my ideals and basic cognitive thinking. The concept of keeping agriculture real has been at the forefront of my life. In theory, the ideas presented at ONE17 were sound. I couldn’t help but wonder if some were feasible, practical and, well, real. One such discussion centered around the grocery stores of tomorrow, or lack thereof. It is estimated that grocery stores as we know them today will soon become “daycare for the elderly.” One statistic went as far as to say box stores will be eliminated by 2028. Despite supporting research conducted by the United States Department of Labor through Willard Bishop, LLC., to say there was skepticism on my mind is an understatement. The research showed fewer Americans are buying food at grocery stores, especially younger consumers, leading to grocers becoming obsolete. In theory, there may be truth in these statements; however, I wasn’t buying it. Practically versus concept: Observation: I know a handful of decision-makers who have begun ordering groceries online. Regardless, the bulk of our family and friends continue to be drawn to the likes of Walmart or Target. Personal application: Living in a rural area, fresh produce isn’t available for shipping. Online shopping won’t be saving me fuel dollars until this service is offered. When I compare prices of Aldi to Amazon, my best buy is Aldi’s. Technical hindrances: There are both delivery and pickup methods offered by Walmart. In concept, my expectation was a great service. Eventually, they may hit the target. However, from my experience, numerous bugs need to be worked out. After spending hours trying to input my list, I ended up driving 30 minutes to purchase my items in person. Lack of convenience: Shipping and picking up groceries each come with a major shortcoming — today’s society needs an experience that is fast, convenient and easy. Anyone can enter a physical store without a list and walk out with $300 in items. Online ordering requires the time and patience to enter grocery items in an app or other device. As these thoughts bounced through my mind, the presenter unexpectedly met my skepticism with additional points. I wasn’t yet committed to making a sale; however, I was listening. Outside of online ordering, I was surprised to learn of the additional types of applications that are currently being applied and tested with real consumers: Amazon Go (unmanned store): Jackpot. No more worrying about ending up in the “talkers” check-out or being stuck in the line that never ends. In contrast, I couldn’t help but wonder if risk management challenges existed. What are the shoplifting rates? Egg vending machines: This portion of the presentation ended with the mention of Asian vending machines for eggs, fruits and perishables, a real-time service that has become as common as phone booths once were. While traveling, I have noted an increase in the variety of vending machines. During a San Francisco Uber ride, my husband and I struck up a conversation with the driver. Our moonlighting Uber driver held a daytime gig designing vending machines for perishable foods. The current project was a concept-phase fresh fruit, smoothie machine. The older my mind becomes, the greater my stubbornness grows. I left ONE17 with the conclusion that while these concepts of the future sound dreamy, they won’t be practical nor will they replace big box stores. Ding-dong. Two weeks following ONE17, I realized my conclusion, potentially, had some issues. In early June, Amazon announced its intention to purchase Whole Foods for $13.7 billion...in cash. I was quickly transported to last year during the holiday season. The historic holiday season set precedent, moving more sales transactions online than in the stores. The powerful retailer has the secret to closing big box stores, and it’s called Amazon Prime. It’s estimated that in the U.S., 60 million people are Prime members, and who tends to spend more on Amazon? Those Primers. The “cha-ching” sound was echoing through my now open mind as I gave in to my stubbornness and acknowledged: big box stores may really become “assisted living” for our elderly, a place for social activity rather than a commerce center.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/walmart-now-assisted-living-market","title":"\n\n                    Is Walmart now in the assisted living market?\n                    ","date":"August 24, 2017","contentLength":798}},{"pageContent":"Americans sure do love their pets. With 68 percent of U.S. households owning a pet, we collectively spent $66.75 billion on our best friends in 2016. It goes without saying how much we care about them, and our concerns certainly include their health and the health of our family members who interact with them on a daily basis. Because we have made our pets a part of our family, we want them to have the best we can offer in food and nutrition, always considering the source of the food, its ingredients and its quality. But the actual safety of their food goes beyond these important considerations. When we think of pet food safety, there are two sides to this issue: the potential that the food could cause harm to our pets, and the possibility that the food could cause harm to family members who interact with them and their food. If we consider food safety for the pet, then we could certainly mention the melamine scare of 2007. In that instance, pet foods were produced with vegetable protein tainted with melamine, an industrial chemical not approved as an ingredient in animal or human food in the United States. The tainted food led to renal failure in many cats and dogs, with some unfortunately dying from their illness. More information about this incident can be found at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website. Another example of contaminants that may sicken our best friends is mycotoxins. These are naturally occurring toxins produced by molds. Mycotoxins can be associated with many plant products as a result of toxigenic molds growing on them. Even though the FDA has regulations and guidelines related to maximum allowed levels for some of these toxins in pet food, once in a while we have issues related to these compounds. One example would be from 2005, when aflatoxin-contaminated dog food was shipped to 22 different states and at least 29 different countries. Nineteen different types of pet foods had to be recalled. The other aspect related to pet food safety is the safety of family members who interact with pets. In more than one instance, human illnesses have been associated with the handling of contaminated pet food. In one of these situations, in 2012, 49 individuals were infected with Salmonella infantis, and investigations found the source of the bacteria was the dry dog food offered by those individuals to their pets. This outbreak also triggered a recall of 17 product brands, representing more than 30,000 tons of dry dog food. Lessons learned for better safety All these incidents have served as painful lessons for the pet food industry, government and pet owners. Much has changed in regard to the implementation of pet food safety management systems by the industry: pet owners have become aware of the potential hazards associated with their pet’s food and guidelines have been promoted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to help prevent outbreaks associated with Salmonella. In an effort to further increase the safety of foods for humans and animals, the FDA has also recently implemented a series of rules, known as the Food Safety Modernization Act, related to the processing of foods that will certainly contribute to reducing the occurrence of these incidents in the U.S. If you would like to learn more about the hazards associated with pet foods, the tools used by the pet food industry to control them, new regulations that will support efforts to produce wholesome and safe pet foods, as well as some guidelines to keep your family safe while feeding your pets, be sure to check back on this blog. Future entries will be dedicated to each of these topics. I want to learn more about pet nutrition.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/recalling-risks-lessons-learned-pet-food-safety","title":"\n\n                    Recalling the risks: Lessons learned in pet food safety \n                    ","date":"November 20, 2017","contentLength":633}},{"pageContent":"What does it mean to “support the good guys” in relation to eggshell quality? Dr. Kayla Price, poultry technical manager for Alltech Canada, discussed how eggshell quality is directly impacted by gut health and balancing our good microbes and potentially bad bacteria. In the webinar “Egg-cellent shell quality: Learn the basics,” Price explained the essentials for a premium egg and the many different factors affecting eggshell quality. According to Price, producers must start thinking about egg development and quality as soon as the birds are in the pullet barn, where the skeleton, immune and digestive systems are developed. Proper development of these key systems creates a consistent growth pattern, maximizing the production from the layer. Calcium: 94% of the eggshell Price discussed the importance of calcium for a hen that is expected to lay almost an egg a day. Different feeding programs will have different calcium particle sizes, which directly affect how well calcium is absorbed. To get good performance out of the bird, we have to make sure we are maintaining the health of the gut to allow for proper calcium absorption. To do this, producers must supplement enough calcium in the feed for the bird to maintain her own health and produce an egg a day. What about the minerals? Price discussed how minerals contribute to the different stages of egg synthesis. Selenium protects the cells and integrity of the reproductive tract. Copper is important for eggshell development, pigments and collagen formation. Manganese aids the formation of the bone and organic matrix of eggshells and is a co-factor in glycoprotein enzyme for shell formation. And, finally, zinc helps bone and eggshell calcification, keratin shell membrane formation and eggshell carbonate production. What else affects eggshell quality?

And, according to a Cato Institute report discussing what African nations need to do to develop and grow, “between 1990 and 2012, the proportion of the population of African countries with access to clean drinking water increased from 48 percent to 64 percent.” Yet, despite the seemingly abundant opportunity, noted Simpson, “industrial potential has not been reached, with farm yields among the lowest in the world, and this is in turn due to numerous challenges.” A “United States of Africa”?: Attempts to bring cohesion to the continent “The biggest obstacles would be education and lack of infrastructure,” observed Nick Smit, Alltech vice president of Africa and the Middle East. In fact, in the view of the Stellenbosch-based Smit, a lack of infrastructure is the single most important obstacle to African economic progress. The continent contains dozens of countries of varying degrees of political, civil, cultural and economic strife and stability, its peoples communicating in more than 1,000 languages. In 1999, leaders of 53 African nations began attempts to pull it all together. By 2002, they had created a new organization, the African Union (AU), to succeed a foundering Organization of African Unity (OAU). South Sudan became the 54th member state in the summer of 2011. Conceived by then Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi as a \"United States of Africa,\" its structure is loosely modeled on that of the European Union. The Constitutive Act of the African Union calls for “a culture of good governance, democracy, rule of law and popular participation.” There are plans to establish an African Economic Community with a single currency. Some critics, pointing out that many AU leaders are the same individuals who presided over the OAU, an organization that became known as the “dictators' club,” question whether the AU can ever be truly effective in bringing the various players of the African continent onto the same page. “Africa has suffered tremendously from this in the past and continues to suffer, even in times when progress is being made,” observed Aidan Connolly, Alltech vice president and chief innovation officer. Adapting to the 21st century “Development of infrastructure is typically a government-level investment,” said Mary Shelman, former director of Harvard Business School's Agribusiness Program. “But it requires a long-term view, which is difficult when governments mostly have short-term orientation.” And in agreement with Smit, she added, “It’s challenging to see market-driven, private sector solutions if governments can't be trusted to stand by contracts and policies.” The need for costly pipelines, dams, irrigation systems, highways, bridges and other forms of public infrastructure only mounts, however, as governments become pressed to come to terms with what looms just over the horizon. “Africa Rising”: The role of agribusiness “The population of the world is due to increase by 50 percent in the next 30 years, from 6 billion to 9 billion people,” noted Connolly in the white paper “A GLIMPSE™ into the Future: A Lens through Which to Consider ‘Africa’s Rising.’” “Sub-Saharan Africa alone will account for one-third of that growth, as the population more than doubles from over 1 billion in 2013 to at least 1.9 billion in 2050.” Citing forecasts by the International Monetary Fund, he noted that Africa has averaged GDP growth of 5 percent annually throughout the past decade, “and that pace is expected to continue, with GDP projected to triple by 2030, achieving a sevenfold increase by 2050.” According to a 2010 report from McKinsey & Co., this recent growth is the result of inflation reduction (dropping from 22 percent in the 1990s to 8 percent in the 2000s), a two-thirds decrease in budget deficits and general institution quality improvements. Taken in combination, these factors have inspired The Economist magazine to coin the phrase “Africa Rising” to describe Africa’s burgeoning population and economic growth and the implications for agribusiness. Much of this activity is concentrated in the southern two-thirds of the continent. “Sub-Saharan Africa has a current food deficit in many countries and the promise of even larger future demand due to population and income increases,” said Shelman. Anticipating and positioning now to efficiently and profitably meet that near-future explosion in demand may present an opening for smart, sustainable agribusiness. “I believe very strongly that the number one way to feed people is to have affordable food, and the number one way to produce food affordably is to allow intensive agriculture the opportunity to produce efficiently,” said Connolly. Africa restructures for more abundant food production The good news is that these dynamics are increasingly being taken into account as African agriculture is restructured to accommodate rapid growth. “We have seen the acceptance of the private sector and multi-stakeholder partnerships really take root, as well as the development of lobby and organization bodies such as the Rice Council of Tanzania,” said Simpson. “This is largely attributed to the government-led economic and political reforms thus far, with a recent initiative being the establishment of Africa’s biggest economic bloc that allows for free trade over 26 countries across the continent.” Shelman adds that there’s been a positive shift from focusing only on improving farming to the development of value chains. “Focusing solely on increasing supply leads to surplus production, which, in the absence of markets, causes farm-gate prices to fall,” she explained. “We now understand the need to develop markets at the same time as supply so product can be 'pulled' through, enabling prices to hold steady and farmer income to improve.” Additionally, Connolly noted that “there are some challenges for which agribusiness is actually the best hope for progress, most notably in supply chain management, markets and innovation.” China as Africa’s deus ex machina? Simpson, stating that Africa has a potential to meet more than the needs of its own population, cited research at University in Munich supporting a commercially oriented approach to land use, with sub-Saharan regions projected to reap the greatest benefit. “Crops cultivated on current cropland at locations where they yield the highest profits could boost yields by 30 percent on top of an increase by almost 39 percent from multiple harvests,” he said. “Optimal agricultural practices can lead to a further increase of 80 percent.” This potential is not lost on China, which is scrambling to manage its own exploding population of middle class consumers. The result is that even while Europeans and Americans remain cautious, viewing Africa as a troubling source of instability, migration and terrorism, China has started to establish its influence on the continent. “Dance of the Lions and Dragons,” a study McKinsey & Co. conducted to improve understanding of “the rhythm of Chinese business in Africa,” states that, “In a mere two decades, China has become Africa’s biggest economic partner. Across trade, investment, infrastructure financing, and aid, there is no other country with such depth and breadth of engagement in Africa.” Since the turn of the 21st century, Africa-China trade has been growing at an annual rate of approximately 20 percent. Foreign direct investment has been even more aggressive, growing at the rate of 40 percent annually, the study observed. It became even more noteworthy in the first quarter of 2017, when China’s direct investment in Africa soared by 64 percent, according to the Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic of China. China’s foreign direct investment in Africa, according to Simpson, has rapidly diversified to include central government-led, state-owned and private investments. It is both a donor and investor in Africa, he said. “China has in recent years encouraged public-private partnerships and provided incentives for its agribusiness corporations to invest in African agriculture to develop sustainability, develop markets and expand trade,” said Simpson. Speaking at a summit in Johannesburg in 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping said Beijing would plough $60 billion into African development projects. According to the Graduate School of Business at the University of Cape Town, Xi’s pledge has been materializing. Trade and investment deals between Chinese firms and African countries include: • A $300 million highway renovation project in Nigeria. • A $230 million ferrochrome mine and smelter project in South Africa. • A $200 million copper project in Zambia. • A $60 million textile factory in Sudan. • A $55 million cement factory in Cape Verde. • A $30 million contract to build a telephone network in Ghana. • A $5 billion China-Africa Development Fund administered by the China Development Bank. • $2 billion in export credits and $3 billion in preferential buyers’ credits. What drives China’s interest in Africa? There are competing views about what motivates the aggressive scale and pace of China’s heightened presence on the African continent. While China has supported many of Africa’s most ambitious infrastructure developments in recent years, Shelman is wary. “Chinese business interests, which could potentially be proxies for Chinese government interests, could have enough investing power and political will to help address the infrastructure problems,” she said. “But I would not necessarily view Chinese interests as truly market-driven.” Shelman’s perception is that “China needs the entire world, including Africa, to produce more so they can buy what they need, when they need it. My view is that their land ownership is an attempt to jump-start African production, and ultimately they may not want to keep these holdings. Others interpret this differently.” The People's Republic has snapped up about 12 million acres of land to grow grains that get shipped back to China, according to Sara Menker, founder of the agriculture data company Gro Intelligence. “The world doesn’t know about it because these are really quiet deals,” she told an audience at a Forbes Reinventing America AgTech Summit. “These are large-scale farming operations in sesame, wheat, corn for export to China. It doesn’t really interact with the African farmer. It doesn’t get traded locally. It is purely for Chinese export.” Offering a competing alternative perspective, the McKinsey & Co. report stated, “around 90 percent of the 10,000 Chinese firms operating in Africa today are privately owned — calling into question the notion of a monolithic, state-coordinated investment drive by ‘China, Inc.’ Although state-owned enterprises tend to be bigger, particularly in specific sectors such as energy and infrastructure, the sheer multitude of private Chinese firms working toward their own profit motives make Chinese investment in Africa a more market-driven phenomenon than is commonly understood.” African agriculture could be abundant, IF… According to the 2017 Alltech Global Feed Survey, the last five years have seen growth in the African region outpace the world. “This year’s growth was over 13 percent,” said the survey of Africa’s 2016 feed production. “Half of the countries grew strongly. Shining stars include Nigeria, Algeria, Tunisia, Kenya and Zambia, all of which saw growth of at least 30 percent.” The World Bank estimates that African farmers could grow enough food to feed the continent — and generate an estimated $20 billion in earnings for their countries — if policy makers can agree to lift cross-border restrictions and simplify the rules and fees involved in food trade, according to Connolly’s white paper. It’s a big “if.” The Cato Institute report finds many African countries plagued with regulatory hurdles. For example: • A study by the Rwanda Ministry of Trade and Industry found that a truck driver traveling the 1,000-mile distance from Kigali to Mombasa, Kenya, must stop at 26 roadblocks and pay bribes (an average of $846) along the way. The study also found that it took 121 hours for drivers to make the trip. • According to a World Bank economist, southern African truck drivers for supermarkets that cross a border can be required to carry a staggering 1,600 documents with them in order to comply with permitting requirements. Connolly noted, however, that progress in reducing red tape is being made. “Rwanda, South Africa and Botswana are now rated as in or near the top 50 (of 189) easiest countries in which to do business, according to the International Finance Corporation,” he said. “However, there is considerable scope for improvement: virtually all of the bottom 20 countries are in sub-Saharan Africa.” The rapid pace of technological innovation also presents a major challenge to African governments, he said. “Whether it is approval of a new type of crop protection chemical or regulation of the ownership of data collected in a field, agriculture requires dealing with complex scientific and legal matters,” said Connolly. This is one area where agribusiness can assist. Agri-scientists are well-positioned to help reduce the scientific gap among industry, academia and government. Additional applications of agribusiness expertise could address environmental sustainability as well as losses attributed to harvesting techniques, mold, insect and animal infestations in storage facilities, packaging and marketing. The roadblocks While Africa’s progress is evident, Connolly cited a formidable litany of continuing obstacles, captured in his GLIMPSE acronym: “government, losses, infrastructure, markets, people, science and the environment.” What is clear, he noted, is “the central role of government, and indeed, not just mandating things, but also freeing businesses up in order to produce food more economically.” In Shelman’s view, the opportunities for agribusiness in Africa are many. “Fresh fruits and vegetables, and products like citrus and avocados that can be exported to Europe and other countries, can command strong prices if the transportation is available,” she said. “The next opportunity,” in her view, “is to develop products for local markets, such as processing tomatoes in Nigeria and rice that can be substituted for imports.” Meats and dairy, she said, “are more challenging due to the need for cold chain and processing capacity, but those are coming as the infrastructure develops.” Back to the days of Alkebulan: Africa as our new “Garden of Eden” Africa was known in ancient days as Alkebulan, meaning “mother of mankind” or “Garden of Eden.” Could its former name designate its destiny? Time will tell. The potential of the African continent is quite clear, yet the challenging impediments to its realization are many. But, keep watching. There is no doubt today that continent-wide change is not only coming — it’s already underway.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/africa-return-garden","title":"\n\n                    Africa: A return to The Garden?\n                    ","date":"December 12, 2017","contentLength":2466}},{"pageContent":"How do you gauge the success of your mineral formulation? How much do you know about the mineral program on your dairy? What level are minerals used in your rations, and what type are they? The mineral program on your dairy has a big impact on the health and productivity of your herd. Dairy producers are generally aware that part of their feed cost includes the minerals they supplement but have no real way to measure the success of their program. Forages and concentrates meet some of the mineral needs of dairy cattle. They do not, however, meet the total mineral requirements of healthy productive cattle. Therefore, supplemental trace minerals are required to maintain cow health, production, reproduction and adequate mineral stores in the animal. The minerals supplemented to dairy cows are classified in two ways: macro and trace minerals. Macro minerals are minerals that are fed in quantities of grams, including calcium, phosphorous, potassium, magnesium, sodium, chlorine and sulfur. Trace minerals are those fed at milligram quantities, including zinc, copper, iodine, selenium, cobalt and molybdenum. Alltech is an industry leader in organic trace mineral programs, with extensive research and industry-leading technologies such as Bioplex® and Sel-Plex®. Achieving optimal mineral formulation can be a challenge Designing an effective mineral program is difficult, especially considering the small inclusion in the diet and variation in mineral content. The National Research Council is generally referenced as a guideline to formulate diets; however, the guidelines are not always up to date and are often ignored. As a result, arbitrary levels are chosen to supplement. Mineral interactions can cause antagonistic effects. For instance, molybdenum, iron and sulfur are some of the minerals that reduce the absorption of other minerals supplemented. Mineral source also has an impact. Organic minerals have been shown to have greater bioavailability than inorganic minerals. Bioavailability of Bioplex® Zinc, for example, is greater than zinc sulfate (J.L. Pierce, et. al. 2006). Considering all the factors at play, correct levels of supplementation are difficult to accomplish. A firsthand look at mineral supplementation in Midwest dairy cattle A survey by the University of Wisconsin-Madison on liver samples from dairy cattle in Wisconsin confirmed the challenges of supplementing trace minerals. Analysis of liver samples indicated that copper was elevated and potentially detrimental (Lyman, 2013). It is important to note, however, that differences in geography and feeding practices within the dairy industry mean that knowing the challenges that are unique to your area are critical when formulating your mineral programs. This past summer, through the help of a local veterinary clinic and an Alltech summer intern, we set out to measure the success of mineral programs along the Interstate 29 corridor. Ben Sieve, Alltech intern, and Dr. Corale Dorn of Dells Veterinary Clinic collected liver samples from dairies along Interstate 29. Liver biopsies on seven cows from five dairies were collected for a total of 35 cows. Samples were analyzed at Michigan State University. Water and TMR were also collected and analyzed by Dairyland Laboratories. Sampled cows averaged 100 days in milk. Average herd size was around 2,000 cows milking. What we learned from the dairy cows along Interstate 29 Elevated copper levels in liver samples were not as common along Interstate 29 compared to the data collected in Wisconsin. Using Michigan State University’s laboratory for analysis, six of the 35 cows measured showed elevated copper levels. Average copper concentration in South Dakota was a 132 parts per million (ppm) wet weight, which compared to an average ppm wet weight of 163 in the Wisconsin survey. Interestingly, we found that zinc deficiency may be more prevalent than we realize. Fifty percent of the sample results were deficient in zinc, according to Michigan State University standards. Selenium levels in South Dakota are often a concern due to elevated selenium in the soil. Elevated selenium levels were observed with some of the dairies surveyed. On-farm responses It is well-documented that organic minerals have higher bioavailability than inorganic ingredients, such as zinc and copper sulfate. Research conducted on Bioplex minerals has identified programs in which 100 percent of the minerals supplemented from organic sources delivered positive performance response. In that trial, cows on 100 percent Bioplex minerals produced 442 kilograms (972 pounds) more milk in a 305-day lactation and had 34 percent lower somatic cell count (SCC) (Kinal, 2007). These programs decrease the excretion of unused minerals, decrease the risk of antagonists and have demonstrated strong production responses in research trials. One of the dairies involved in the Interstate 29 mineral study implemented these practices into their mineral program. Hilltop Dairy started feeding Bioplex minerals in fall 2016. By using Bioplex, they required lower levels of minerals. The results from the liver survey showed Hilltop Dairy more appropriately in the ranges suggested by Michigan State University. “After nearly a year, our dairy’s SCC is down 43 percent, and we are up in milk production compared to last year,” said Hilltop Dairy owner, Wilfried Reuvekamp. “Normally in the summer, SCC goes up and production goes down. We have never had a summer like this!” Learn more information on Bioplex® and Sel-Plex®.

Although this is often used in the context of human nutrition, I think it may be relevant for pets as we see novel ingredients and new superfoods coming into the food chain. There is so much information out there about the next best food for you and/or for your pet — what you should add — or not — to your pet’s food and even how to make your own pet food. With Google at hand, you can become an instant nutrition expert. For those adventurous enough to make their own pet food, you must consider that the food needs to be in complete balance, or sola dosis facit venenum — the dose makes the poison. The complete balance of nutrients is important, as is the total amount. An excessive nutrient can cause toxicity, or its deficiency can cause serious health issues. Take zinc, for example. Zinc deficiency results in what is known as zinc responsive dermatosis, which causes symptoms such as hair loss and scaling and crusting of the skin around the face, head and legs. On the other hand, over-supplementation of zinc can result in interference of absorption of other nutrients and minerals like calcium, copper and iron. What are superfoods, and what makes them so special? They are typically of plant origin but can include some fish and dairy. They are called “superfoods” because they are thought to be packed with vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, healthy fats, etc. Some of these superfoods have found their way into pet foods, like blueberries, turmeric and coconut oil, to mention a few. Their inclusion rate is low and in moderation, and they are listed by the The Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO, the pet food regulatory body). Other superfoods, like acai berry or garcinia cambogia, will not be seen in pet foods yet, because we do not know how they would affect your pet and, therefore, are not approved ingredients to be used in pet food. As I work with pet food companies from all over the world, one thing I notice is the use of food to support well-being. It is a trend that just keeps growing and growing. Pet food companies know that the best way to keep our best friends happy and healthy is through using quality ingredients, the proper balance of nutrients, adequate amounts of vitamins, the proper ratio of fatty acids, the use of proteinated minerals, and sources of probiotics and prebiotics for digestive health. Proteinated minerals have proven to provide shinier hair coats, and prebiotics and probiotics help to keep the bad bacteria out of the body. The result is a healthy digestive tract that is able to absorb all the nutrients that come flying past the intestinal villi, and take them right up into the body where they are needed. Trends come and go, but choosing a pet food based on pet health rather than cost is something that will never go out of style. If only there was a magic ingredient, like the spring water in “Tuck Everlasting,” then I could dream about walking my dog down to his favorite spot by the river for the next 150 years…","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/how-pet-friendly-superfood","title":"\n\n                    How pet-friendly is that superfood?\n                    ","date":"October 20, 2017","contentLength":533}},{"pageContent":"My grandfather used to talk to me about the “spring flush” and the “fall slump.” To me, these words were as synonymous with the changing seasons as “spring ahead” and “fall back.” Advancements in management, tillage practices and nutrition have reduced the differences in production that some of our pasturing neighbors might experience with the “spring flush.” However, I still see farms of all shapes, sizes and styles face the dreaded “fall slump” on an annual basis with new crop corn silage. Production losses of 2–8 pounds of milk can be common, coupled with surges in fat and protein and increased instances of hindgut fermentation. Let’s take a closer look at some of the causes and potential solutions to this corn conundrum. What’s behind the annual “fall slump” with new crop corn silage? Corn silage can be the most energy-dense forage that we feed. Comparatively, it also has the highest yield potential and is, arguably, the most consistent forage that we harvest. Despite these benefits, there can be some drawbacks, including variability in quality related to changes affecting starch and fiber. Of all these challenges, there is one in particular that reigns supreme over the king of forages. It is, of course, our friend and nemesis, Mother Nature, which can give us bumper crops or colossal failures. Success often hinges on the weather at the time of planting, silking and harvesting. Temperature and rainfall amounts can swing the pendulum, causing corn silage yield to range from 10 tons to the acre to 30 tons to the acre. Fiber There is significant research on fiber digestibility in corn silage. Much of that information shows that neutral detergent fiber (NDF) digestibility does not really increase over time, post-harvest. It seems that, in most cases, we have what we have. The greatest influences on NDF digestion are based on genetics, varietal differences and, most importantly, the weather. Years ago, certain cuttings and certain crops just fed well, but we were not sure why because the traditional fiber measurement methods of lignin, acid detergent fiber and NDF did not clearly distinguish performance. New testing methods and research can now demonstrate that the once-leaned-on lignin numbers were good on legumes but wildly variable on grasses, small grains and corn silage. With all the recent research on both 30-hour NDF digestibility and undigested NDF (uNDF240), we know so much more about the fast and slow pools of forage digestion. A major nemesis to digestibility in our forage crop is the plant itself. We are beginning to understand the effects of cross-linking, the plant’s defense against stress, on our corn silage as well as other forages. Cross-linking in the fiber portion of the plant will lock up digestibility as a defense mechanism. Because of the unknowns that come with Mother Nature, we can do everything just right and still have a silage crop that feeds below average. There are three solid fiber-specific strategies for coping with the loss in production in the fall: 1. Feeding digestible corn silage varieties like brown mid-rib can reduce the lag time that it takes for the starch portion of the forage to catch up. Of course, selecting the correct relative maturity for the climate, elevation and soil type will make optimal harvesting much easier to achieve. 2. Tweak the digestible fiber that is delivered to the cow. In the past, wise nutritionists would outsmart the silage slump with a combination of increased starch levels and forage fiber sources like soy hulls, citrus pulp and wet brewers grain. The addition of these fiber byproducts can reduce the percentage of the indigestible forage. 3. Utilization of fiber-digesting enzymes like Fibrozyme® can help unlock some of the forage potential. Starch The real wild card is the starch portion of the corn silage plant. Research on monitoring the seven-hour starch digestibility levels yields some telling information over time. Starch digestion starts off at a crawl and ends up in a sprint. Many trials show that the starch portion is still increasing digestibility at close to 300 days after harvest. Our milk fat test surely knows the feeding difference between new crop corn silage and feeding out 9-month-old corn silage. Why does this happen? Kernel type is a vital piece of the puzzle. There’s been a lot of talk of flinty versus floury kernels, and there’s been quite a bit of recent trial work on floury kernel types. The protein-starch matrix is crucial to how the corn will digest. The more vitreous the kernel type, the longer it will take to achieve maximum digestibility. Corn breeders are researching varieties and kernel types that will feed out faster than they have in the past. Recent research suggests that lower test weight varieties will feed out quicker than higher test weight varieties. We can tweak the starch digestion somewhat with management during harvest and some management of the cow. Adequate processing of the kernels at harvest will help to break down the particle size, which will aid in starch digestion. Additionally, starch-digesting enzymes, like Amaize®, have been shown to assist in breaking down some of the starch so that the rumen can utilize it more efficiently. Consult with your seed representative, agronomist and nutritionist to see what the best option is for your soil type, ration and day length.

Poor growth, immaturity and high variability within the litter can lead to variation in performance as the piglets progress through the grower and finisher phases, causing increases in costs at slaughter. This may negate the “all-in/all-out” (AIAO) strategy used on many farms, in which pigs reach age when they have reached finished weight. All piglets should be checked at weaning Monitoring weight gain immediately before weaning is important to make sure that there are no growth issues in the first seven days after weaning. Several strategies can be implemented to avoid problems with subsequent performance. All piglets should be checked at weaning to ensure target and uniform weights are attained. The manager can either group piglets by litters or by body weight; both groups have pros and cons, so the choice should be consistent across litters. During the first four days after weaning, specific attention to the housing environment is essential to eliminate cold spots and draughts. Solid boards, rather than slatted floors, should be used. All weaned piglets must have free access to clean water They should also be provided with highly digestible feed that they find palatable. The feed should be soaked with water for the first two days to encourage intake. Feed should be offered in enough open dishes to allow free access for all the animals during the first three days post-weaning. Troughs should be large enough to supply feed to all piglets after this date. Poor access to feed can lead to smaller animals being excluded from feeding. Use a highly digestible and palatable diet Diets should include proven enzyme supplementation to enhance digestion, as well as products such as Actigen®, which will balance microflora and contribute to good gut health at this important time. Specialist ingredients, such as nucleotides, can be used to promote the development of the digestive tract. Creep feed should be available little and often throughout the day — perhaps four or five times — and any refusals or stale feed should be discarded. Group the pigs by weight Seven days or so after weaning, any small piglets should be removed and placed together in a separate pen within the same house. They should be maintained on the creep diet for longer to allow their body weight to catch up with their siblings. Any in-feed medication prescribed by a veterinarian should be administered during the first 10 days after weaning. Use different diets according to body weight and age As the piglets progress in age and weight, diets must be adjusted to match their changing requirements. The environment needs to be controlled and changed accordingly (e.g., temperature). This will prevent the development of respiratory and other diseases as well as help maintain optimal conditions for growth and health. Feeding age-and weight-appropriate diets with proven zootechnical ingredients to promote digestive function and the ideal gut environment are crucial to the development and efficiency of the intestinal tract. Without the appropriate diet, or if the pigs are exposed to gut pathogens, the villi that line the gut may be damaged. This may lead to atrophy and poor endogenous enzyme secretions, poor mucous protection and reduced nutrient absorption. Because only minimal amounts of feed are consumed during the pre-weaning period, attention to detail during this stage is important for the health and productivity of the animals until slaughter age. Key factors dictate the degree of villus atrophy Several factors affect the chances of the piglet developing atrophied villi after weaning. The age and weight at weaning is important, as this is a measure of the animal’s maturity and ability to cope with weaning stresses. Environmental factors within the house are also important; if not controlled correctly, it can add further stress to the piglet and make it more susceptible to disease. Feed should be palatable and highly digestible to ensure that it is digested in the upper ileum and does not bypass enzyme breakdown, which can result in the feed flowing into the hind gut, where it will act as a substrate for non-beneficial bacteria. This can lead to the development of gastrointestinal disease. Certainly, protein is important in this respect, as bypassed protein can be utilized by toxic bacteria such as Clostridia spp. Feed and water hygiene will help reduce the introduction of many pathogens into the piglets, and whilst feed is often monitored, water troughs and water quality may not always be. Many pathogens are transmitted via dirty water systems.

The prospect of taking on the rigorous endeavor can be daunting. Russell Gilliam, Alltech's U.S. swine business manager, has a list of areas that he feels are most important for rebuilding a facility to lower costs and increase comfort for workers and pigs. He asks questions that are important to consider and includes helpful tips from his 20 years of experience in the swine industry. The following is a checklist with Gilliam’s suggestions, consolidated from his talk at ONE: The Alltech Ideas Conference 2017. What are your goals? What would you like to accomplish? What type of market are you going to sell to? What do you already have in your barns that will work? Picture your ideal operation. What does it look like? What does it not look like? If you have an ideal operation in mind, you can proceed to making the more technical decisions that are going to produce the facility that will help you reach your goals. Master checklist for remodeling/rebuilding swine production facilities Pens Crates or pens This may differ based on your farm location due to laws and regulations. Questions to consider: How big are your pens? How many pigs per pen? How big are the pigs? Penning equipment “Oftentimes, we select our penning equipment based on the animals in the barn, and we may forget about the opportunity to increase worker safety and comfort while replacing gates,” said Gilliam. Questions to consider: Does this work for the animal and employees? TIP: A walk-through gate might be easier for employees to use. Easier access means better animal care and improvements in animal performance. Facility Monitoring equipment Will the facility be strictly for production, or will there be research done as well? Fans There are different demands based on location and climate. Match your selection to the air quality expectations in your area. Heaters What kind of heater do you really need? Will it be used for small or young pigs, or is one required to heat the barn throughout the life cycle? Concrete slats Check the width of the opening. Is it too wide? Sometimes hooves can get stuck in slats that are too wide, causing injury. Check the thickness of the slats. Are they strong enough to hold the pigs? Research the supplier. Do they have a good track record in the industry? LED or inexpensive lighting Inexpensive lighting can reduce costs upfront. LED lighting can extend the day length for pigs, stimulate feed intake and put workers in a better mood. Although it costs more, LED lights may help you save money in the long run. You will need fewer lights, and they tend to last longer than inexpensive lights. There are also energy grants available in the U.S. for reduced electricity costs. TIP: “Pigs don’t see very well, so we need to make sure we have the lights placed where they eat and drink,” said Gilliam. Feed Electronic or manual feeding Electronic feeding allows producers to track the animals’ eating habits in real time: if they are eating, when they are eating and how much they consume. This information can be seen by the producer on his/her phone anywhere. Manual feeding (hand-feeding or drop boxes) allows for changes or alterations to be made while walking through the barn. Additionally, it eliminates the worry of technology breakdowns. Bins How many bins are needed? Will they run in tandem? How many phases will you feed? TIP: If feeding in multiple phases, consider adding bins. Feeding system There are numerous feeding systems on the market. Match your choice to your expectations and to the volume of feed that will be going through your barn. TIP: “Keep in mind how many times (the feeding system) will have to turn corners in your barns because some technology can turn around corners easier than others,” said Gilliam. Feeders What type of genetics are you feeding? How do they eat? All day? Three times per day? TIP: For pigs that eat a certain number of times per day, make sure that the feeder is larger and has more space to help reduce aggression. Water Water meters “I’m a big fan of water meters,” said Gilliam. “I really feel like they help us to make early production decisions based on the health of our pigs, and it tells us when they’re stressed.” Water medicators Water medicators make it easier to have water interventions. Interventions can be done more quickly and can be monitored to ensure the desired response. There are different styles and types of medicators, and they should be matched to their usage purpose and rate. Drinkers Who is drinking: sows, nursery or grow-finish pigs? Will the drinkers be hanging, swinging or mounted to the wall? Will you use pans, cups or nibble bars? Consider looking at different types of nipple technology. TIP: Avoid spraying. In addition to water waste, spraying can scare young pigs. “If we splash them in the face, they have a little bit of reluctance to go drink,” said Gilliam. Final thoughts Gilliam said the following three items are his non-negotiables: water medicators, water meters and LED lighting. The extra benefits, especially for the health and welfare of the pig, far outweigh the extra costs. New technology, such as sensors, can also be beneficial to your operation. Sensors on sows allow convenience and efficiency in multiple areas. They can send a message to your phone when the sow is ready to farrow, prompting a heat lamp to automatically turn on just for that sow and not the entire barn. This greatly reduces energy cost and is better for the overall care of the pigs. One of the most exciting innovations, however, is electronic barn monitoring. Gilliam calls it “the future of (the pig business).” It allows you to monitor the barn remotely, see problems in specific pens and then communicate it to all your farm workers. “I can connect every single piece of my farm to my phone and then send it right out to the internet so that my farm managers can see it,” said Gilliam. Rebuilding or remodeling can be nerve-wracking. However, knowing where to be frugal and where to invest your money will help you make decisions that work best for your operation and, as Gilliam said, “give your animals the opportunity to reach optimum performance.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/ultimate-checklist-rebuilding-prime-swine-facility","title":"\n\n                    The ultimate checklist for rebuilding a prime swine facility\n                    ","date":"December 1, 2017","contentLength":1080}},{"pageContent":"Silage samples from across the U.S., Canada and Europe have shown high levels of mycotoxins, according to the Alltech 2017 Harvest Analysis. The high reading comes on the heels of similar findings in 2016. As the name implies, mycotoxins are toxic. They can negatively affect the health of animals if contaminated feedstuffs are ingested. The symptoms can be many and varied, but the outcome in all cases will be reduced performance and lost profits. Produced by certain molds, more than 500 mycotoxins have been discovered to date. Each affects the animal or human in a certain way. Some mycotoxins are carcinogenic, neurotoxic and immunosuppressive. Climate change and feed storage practices are starting to influence the range of molds occurring in farm feedstocks. And with traditional tilling and crop rotation practices diminishing in many developed countries, mold contamination is persisting year-on-year, making the multiple mycotoxin threat very real. U.S. sampling shows high mycotoxin count Samples from American farms submitted to the Alltech 37+® mycotoxin analytical services laboratory in Kentucky between Sept. 1 and Nov. 1, 2017, show that grains contained mixtures of mycotoxins, including deoxynivalenol (DON), fusaric acid and fumonisin. Fumonisin is commonly found in corn at levels of 2 parts per million (ppm) or less, but this year, testing has confirmed levels well above 30 ppm, and some above 100 ppm. Forages such as corn silage, barlage and haylage samples also contained multiple mycotoxins in 2017, including DON, fusaric acid, type A trichothecenes (T-2) and fumonisin. “It’s particularly high right now,” said Dr. Max Hawkins, nutritionist with the Alltech® Mycotoxin Management team. “In the Wisconsin-Minnesota area, we’re about seven-tenths of a mycotoxin-per-sample higher than a year ago. More of the samples we’re seeing have the mycotoxins in them, and the major toxins that are present are four to five times higher than they were a year ago.” The Canadian findings are much the same Samples submitted for the Alltech 2017 Canadian Harvest Analysis indicated high levels of DON and zearalenone (ZEA) in grain and forage. Submitted between Sept. 1 and Oct. 15, 2017, the samples show that grains contained mixtures of mycotoxins, including DON and ZEA. Forages such as corn silage, barlage and haylage samples also contained multiple mycotoxins in 2017, particularly from mycotoxins produced by Fusarium species of molds, such as DON, ZEA and T-2/HT-2 toxins. Mycotoxin risk levels high in Europe, as well The Alltech 37+ lab in Dunboyne, Ireland, analyzed samples of wheat, barley, corn, corn silage and grass silage submitted from across Europe. The grain crops are showing risk levels of trichothecenes from DON and T-2 to swine. Silages are showing risk levels of not only DON and T-2, but also high levels of Penicillium and, to a lesser degree, aflatoxin, according to Alltech’s 2017 European Summer Harvest Analysis. What’s causing this? Weather conditions can be a major influence. “Some areas have seen record levels of rain, some areas are experiencing record drought conditions,” Dr. Alexandra Weaver, Alltech Mycotoxin Management technical specialist, said of the European findings. “That’s going to play a big role in the level of mycotoxins you see as well as what types of mycotoxins.” Weather factors are also suspected in the United States. “A lot of areas have gone through a cool, wet summer, and cool, wet weather is the preferred environment for Fusarium mold,” said Hawkins. “Fusarium is the mold that produces DON, T-2, ZEA and fusaric acid. Those are the mycotoxins that can become very problematic, and they already appear to be very problematic this year in the corn silage crop.” Higher levels of mycotoxins appear to be a lingering legacy of the havoc Hurricane Harvey delivered to the Texas Gulf Coast in mid-August. “In Texas, we have really dramatically high levels of fumonisin,” said Hawkins. “You can track it northward from where that rainfall came up from the Gulf and across the Texas panhandle into Kansas and Nebraska. The levels of fumonisin will begin to decrease, but they’re still much higher than we would typically see in those areas.” Weather’s important, but there are other factors While weather is linked to the higher mycotoxin rates of recent years, Weaver suggested that other important factors are contributing to the scope of the findings, including better detection methods as well as increased awareness among farmers. “We have better ability to test for these toxins now; different agronomic practices play a role — the idea of ‘no-till’ versus ‘till’ has an influence; the use of fungicides may have an influence,” she said. “So there are things that play into this whole topic rather than just the weather, but certainly weather events with excess moisture are going to have a big impact.” Watching for co-occurrence of mycotoxins The Alltech 37+ analysis examines over 40 individual mycotoxins in minute levels: parts per billion. The laboratories are especially vigilant for samples containing more than one type of mycotoxin. “We have a fairly thorough understanding of the additive effects of mycotoxins,” said Hawkins. “But many mycotoxins can have synergistic effects for DON and for fusaric acid. When you have those two together in the same feed or the same ingredient, one plus one does not necessarily equal two. One plus one may equal three, four or five in terms of magnified or synergistic effects.” Mycotoxins present researchers with challenging paradoxes. Feeding multiple mycotoxins at low levels can be as detrimental or worse than feeding one mycotoxin at a high level, explained Hawkins. One mold species may produce many different mycotoxins, and several species may produce the same mycotoxin. Hawkins wants people to be aware of multiple mycotoxins and the risk that they present. “As you make more complex feeds with more ingredients, you’re bringing more and different combinations of mycotoxins into one place, where the animal will have the opportunity to consume it, so the opportunity for risk goes up,” he said. Helping farmers gain the advantage The Alltech® RAPIREADTM tool delivers an integrated system of tools and technologies to the farm to enable quick on-site analysis. “It’s a handheld lateral-flow device,” explained Hawkins. “We can take samples on-farm for feed ingredients — corn, grain, distillers grains, corn silage — and we don’t check for a broad array of toxins, we’re looking for one, two or three toxins that could be on a very problematic level. “So, for example, if we’re in Texas, we might be checking corn grain for high fumonisin levels; if we’re in Wisconsin, we might be checking corn silage for high DON or high T-2 levels,” he continued. “And we can give them that answer on the spot within 10 to 20 minutes.” Based on the information produced by RAPIREAD, the Alltech team can put together a basic management program to help the farmer mitigate the risk of animals going through a period of stress or suffering. “When the analysis comes back showing extremely high levels of mycotoxins in corn silage — to the point that they didn’t think that they would be able to feed that corn silage — the Alltech team can show them how they can continue to feed the silage they’ve invested in,” said Hawkins. “Alltech puts together a program, monitoring and tweaking as they go along. We can show them that, if they manage it properly in the right program setting, they can still use a feed that has mycotoxins present.” Alltech® MIKO, a program based on HACCP principles (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points), identifies the mycotoxin risks within a farm or feed mill and creates a plan to minimize the risks to the animal and protect the profitability of operations. Alltech’s Mycosorb A+® reduces the threat of mycotoxins in animal feed. The technology reduces mycotoxin absorption within the animal, negating the damaging effects of mycotoxins on its health. “Farmers should carefully consider if and how feed with mycotoxins is used,” cautioned Weaver. “Even minimal changes in feed quality can have a big impact on an animal’s production over time.” Effective mycotoxin management is about seeing the whole challenge, from the farm to feed mill and from risk assessment to feed management. The Alltech Mycotoxin Management team has produced a number of species-specific fact sheets, which explain the impact of mycotoxins.

But busy lifestyles can present all sorts of obstacles to actually practicing “wellness.” Getting enough exercise is one issue, but making sure we keep our bodies fed with essential nutrients can also fall victim to time pressures and convenience. Functional foods, such as enriched eggs, can fill the gap, delivering essential nutrients in delicious forms that most of us already enjoy. “Fortified” foods have been around for nearly a century. Vitamin D was added to milk in the 1920s to combat rickets in young children, around the same time when salt was enriched with iodine to combat goiter, a disease of the thyroid gland. But cultures with low fish consumption are more or less starved of one very essential nutrient: omega-3 fatty acids. Intake of fatty acids in general populations worldwide does not meet dietary recommendations to prevent coronary heart disease, according to a review of data from 40 countries. reported in the Annals of Nutrition and Metabolism. “Three fatty acids make up the omega-3 family: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA),” explained Alltech registered dietitian nutritionist Nikki Putnam. “Each of these omega-3 fatty acids is considered essential, meaning that they cannot be synthesized by the human body. “However, not all omega-3 fatty acids are created equal,” she continued. “DHA is the most important of the omega-3 fatty acids and is primarily responsible for the benefits commonly associated with omega-3 foods and supplements.” Traditionally, there has been a lack of discrimination between the various omega-3 fatty acids, and effects have been broadly attributed to the trio as a whole, according to the National Institutes of Health. Evidence of the unique effects of DHA is growing. Well-known for its cardiovascular benefits, it has been documented that omega-3 DHA also improves cognitive development and can combat behavioral problems, such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Improved mental health, a reduction in inflammatory and auto-immune disease, and overall general well-being are among other benefits. Some of the more promising outcomes are being documented in people who regularly consume DHA-enriched eggs. Gaining a great deal of attention in this area is research conducted in Thailand by Dr. Mongkol Kaewsutas, a veterinarian. “The research carried out by Kaewsutas suggests that increasing dietary intake of DHA via functional food — DHA-enriched eggs — rather than through traditional pills or capsules, can help to improve brain cognitive function,” said Putnam. Kaewsutas reasoned that eggs are an inexpensive source of daily protein and, as such, could be used to deliver DHA. The problem was odor. DHA can be obtained from fish oil, but he doubted “fishy-smelling” eggs would appeal to consumers. So he turned to another natural source: algae. “Feeding 2 percent microalgae (Schizochytrium sp.) in the diet of hens for at least four weeks resulted in an increase in the DHA level to above 100 milligrams per egg,” he found. He wanted to test the theory that a diet including daily consumption of microalgae-DHA-enriched eggs could impact areas of the brain responsible for executive function and cognitive activities such as planning, problem-solving and focused attention. Forty-five healthy subjects, all in their early twenties, were selected from among soldiers at Medical Battalion, Phramongkutklao Hospital in Bangkok for an eight-week trial. Subjects were randomly assigned to consume two boiled eggs per day: either normal eggs (51.82 milligrams of DHA per day) or microalgae-DHA eggs (278 milligrams of DHA per day). Electroencephalograms (EEG) were used to measure brainwave patterns before and after the trial. The conclusion, according to Kaewsutas: “The consumption of two DHA-enriched eggs per day can improve brain reaction time 22 percent after eight weeks of consumption. There was no change (in brain reaction time) with subjects who had normal eggs in their meals.” Four to eight weeks of DHA egg consumption, he found, seems to improve imagination, visualization, memory, learning, concentration, logic and critical reasoning. “Alltech’s dried microalgae fermentation products give producers the opportunity to increase the nutrient content of eggs, as well as meats and milk, without changing the flavor and quality consumers expect,” said Putnam. In another study conducted by researchers at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, low daily doses of omega-3 fatty acids, around 1,080 milligrams, were found to help decrease the frequency of epileptic seizures in people who haven’t been helped by drug treatments. This was the experience of 9-year-old Maya Teves, who, unrelated to the UCLA study, experienced a sharp reduction in her epilepsy symptoms after adding at least three DHA-enriched eggs per day to her diet. Her father, farmer Wilfred Teves from Davao City, the Philippines, began working with Alltech scientists to develop an enriched egg product that will soon go to market under the brand Mega Eggs. Another egg producer, one of the largest in the U.K., LJ Fairburn & Son Limited, moved into the production of enriched eggs, but their initial approach ran into problems. Sarah Louise Fairburn, the company’s brand and sales director, explained why her family switched their enrichment process to an Alltech solution. “We were selling an omega egg line into major retail, but the linseed product we were using in our hens’ diets was making them ill,” said Fairburn. “They went completely off their food, as they didn’t find this product palatable. And, of course, a hen that doesn’t want to eat her food isn’t a happy one and doesn’t lay as many eggs.” Fairburn turned to Alltech’s algae product. “The hens absolutely loved it,” she said. But, wait. Wouldn’t consuming more eggs raise your cholesterol levels? “As it turns out,” noted Nikki Putnam, “dietary cholesterol does not impact our blood cholesterol the way physicians and dietitians once believed. It’s saturated fat — not dietary cholesterol — that has the greatest dietary impact on raising blood cholesterol.” The value to consumers of enriching eggs with DHA is tremendous, according to Putnam. “With the addition of algae to the layer diet,” she said, “a naturally DHA-rich egg is produced, giving the consumer the opportunity to easily increase their DHA intake, which was previously only associated with fatty fish, in a convenient, economical, tasty and easy-to-prepare package — the egg.” I want to learn more about poultry nutrition.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/egging-healthy-habit","title":"\n\n                    Egging on a healthy habit\n                    ","date":"October 12, 2017","contentLength":1076}},{"pageContent":"In this series, we have investigated the many ways Alltech has harnessed bioscience under the guidance of its ACE principle to reconcile producer profitability with agriculture’s impacts. All of this against a backdrop of a burgeoning global population and increasing concerns about our environmental stewardship. Part four concludes the series with an overview of ACE: where it came from, what it has inspired and how it is leading the company into the future. Serendipity can happen in a sentence. Consider the origin of the Alltech ACE principle, the architecture of a corporate research and development framework that materialized in the mind of company founder Dr. Pearse Lyons while traveling the world nearly 30 years ago. Dr. Pearse Lyons, president and founder of Alltech “We were talking about the things we were doing, the products we were developing and the move against antibiotics,” recalled Dr. Lyons. “Professor Archimede Mordenti, from the University of Bologna, who sadly passed away, was the chairman of a meeting in Italy. He said, ‘I don’t know if you realize it, but you are describing a company that will be friendly to animals, consumers and the environment.’ He could see where we were going, even before we could.” “ACE” has since become firmly embedded in the Alltech DNA, a guiding reminder that the company’s product lines, programs and concepts must benefit the animal, the consumer and the environment. That’s a tall order, and it has taken time for the agriculture industry’s priorities to shift in the direction of this more holistic philosophy. “ACE was not popular amongst animal farmers when first proposed at the Alltech Symposium in 1989 by professor Mordenti,” said Aidan Connolly, Alltech's chief innovation officer and vice president of corporate accounts. “Most believed that animal production should only focus on food availability, affordability and safety. How far our industry has come.” Aidan Connolly, vice president and chief innovation officer This vision was indeed somewhat radical at a time when the application of chemicals and antibiotics dominated agriculture’s approach to issues impeding productivity. “Dr. Lyons decided from the beginning that it was not going to be a chemical or antibiotic-based approach to food animal nutrition,” added Dr. Kate Jacques, Alltech nutrition director. “They were going to dump money into research to find new ways around it. Thirty years ago, that was a very radical idea. It was one we had to drag into the light.” “We went against the stream,” remembered Dr. Lyons. “Indeed, on a couple of occasions, when we made awards to people who had made breakthroughs, the industry reacted against us and we lost customers. However, we stuck to our guns, and the fact now is that we have literally billions of chickens and pigs around the world on the Alltech Antibiotic-Free program.” Scientific to the core Science in support of sustainability is the foundation of ACE. But in the early days of the company, industry resistance to this idea was not the only obstacle the company had to overcome. “We were starting a business in Kentucky, and we did not have the people with the specific knowledge in the areas that we were to be working,” noted Dr. Lyons. “So, we had to effectively develop our own team. Therefore, we developed the people through our Ph.D. and master’s degree programs. “We are very proud of the fact that we have had over 260 people do their master’s degree and Ph.D.s with us,” he continued. “We pay two-thirds of the cost, and they pay one-third. When they finish their program, we pay them the one-third of the cost, plus another one-third. It is by reinvesting in education that we have been able to build our business.” An architecture for ideas Creating such career-advancing educational opportunities has attracted dedicated, highly educated professionals to work within the ACE structure. Their innovations have positioned Alltech to offer an array of sustainable alternatives to the use of chemicals and antibiotics in farming. Among the earliest products in the company portfolio is Sel-Plex®, Alltech's proprietary organic form of selenium yeast. Manufactured to mimic Mother Nature, this organic form is better absorbed, stored and utilized by the animal than inorganic selenium. “We pioneered the fact that you could use one-third the level of minerals if you put it into the biologically appropriate form,” said Dr. Lyons. “As a matter of fact, you will see a two-thirds reduction in pollution and, indeed, improvement in animal and human performance.” A turning point was reached 10 years ago in Alltech’s work in nutrigenomics, the study of the interaction of nutrition and genes, especially in regard to the prevention or treatment of disease: humans may also see a direct benefit from Alltech’s mineral technology. The research has indicated that when fed to animals, Sel-Plex favorably altered the activity of certain biological pathways associated with several serious human illnesses, Alzheimer’s disease prominent among them. “Out of this work came the observation by the late professor Bill Markesbery of the University of Kentucky’s Sanders-Brown Center on Aging that there was an opportunity on the human side for Alzheimer’s patients,” said Dr. Lyons. “From his observation, we launched a research program to find the active ingredients. Here we are today with our AT-001 (Sel-Plex) now in Phase II of the FDA’s clinical studies for Alzheimer’s.” The paradigm shifts In recent years, the agriculture industry has been turning to these rapidly emerging, often revolutionary technologies to support production and profitability while sustaining a healthy environment and serving an increasingly aware and demanding consumer. “The ACE principle has long served as the primary driving force and standard for developing all new research, product lines and applications,” said Dr. Karl Dawson, Alltech’s chief scientific officer. “It is truly part of our research culture at Alltech. Our approach has always been to use the most recent biotechnologies to investigate, develop and apply natural solutions to many of the problems that limit the efficiencies of agricultural production.” These have included the science of nutrigenomics, as well as some of the most advanced tools in molecular and analytical chemistry, and trend-setting fermentation technologies. Going bananas in Costa Rica Alltech Crop Science provides an example with its non-chemical solution to black sigatoka, also known as “black leaf streak,\" a fungal blight plaguing the banana groves of Costa Rica. Kyle McKinney examines banana leaves for signs of black sigatoka. “From a consumer standpoint and part of ACE, the consumer is driving down inputs on crops,” noted Dr. Kyle McKinney, Alltech Crop Science development manager for Central America and the Caribbean. “They want healthier foods for their families to eat. That’s the big reason we started the project in Costa Rica, but that’s really the overall spectrum of Alltech Crop Science.” Deploying Alltech’s soil-microbiome stimulating Soil-Set® and plant nutrition supplement Agro-Mos®, McKinney and his team have developed a consumer- and environment-friendly alternative to the practice of weekly aerial sprayings of chemical fungicides. In the interest of ethical productivity Animal health and welfare have always been a key component of Alltech research and product development strategies. “The well-being of animals is not only important to our view of the ethical treatment of livestock, but also results in more productive agricultural practices,” said Dawson. “This has resulted in the development of feed supplementation strategies that use natural ingredients and fermentation products to improve health and improve nutrition.” Alltech animal nutrition strategies are designed to benefit the spectrum of species, from ruminants and swine to poultry and fish, to horses and pets. “Apart from strictly reducing the amount of a pollutant like methane that comes from an animal, we also look at the efficiency with which these animals produce food for humans, said Alltech research project manager Amanda Gehman. “If we can have an efficient animal, that animal is by nature a more environmentally sustainable animal.” An Alltech facility in Winchester, Kentucky, acquired in 2010, has since become one of the world’s largest commercial algae production sites. Work taking place there addresses the pressure on wild fisheries to provide fish oil and fish meal to the world’s expanding aquaculture operations. As a consequence of overfishing, many wild fisheries have been teetering on collapse. “We believe we have a real solution in our algae that will reduce reliance on fish oil while increasing the amount of DHA available to farmed fish and, ultimately, to consumers,” said Dr. Jorge Arias, Alltech’s global director for aquaculture. The new Alltech Coppens Aqua Centre in the Netherlands is working to deliver new technologies, including algae, aimed at achieving greater efficiency and sustainability. Since joining Alltech in 2016, Coppens International, an aquatic feed solutions company in the Netherlands, has collaborated with Alltech’s research teams to introduce several new algae-based products containing innovative technologies such as ForPlus®, a sustainable algae-derived fish oil replacer that delivers very high levels of DHA.. Concern for the consumer Why would an animal feed company have interest in ensuring high levels of DHA? Western diets are seriously deficient in this omega-3 fatty acid that is a primary structural component of the human brain, cerebral cortex, skin and retina. Yet, vertebrates do not manufacture DHA, so it must be consumed in our foods. “What we’re doing with our DHA enrichment program is making omega-3 fatty acids more accessible to the consumer by adding them to food products that they already enjoy eating, that they already buy, that they already know how to prepare, that are fairly inexpensive and are convenient,” explained Nikki Putnam, registered dietitian nutritionist and a nutrition solutions specialist at Alltech. “So, chicken, eggs, dairy products, beef, bacon — we can put DHA in all of those food products.” Where all of this is going Alltech continues to invest in natural-based approaches to agricultural production. Over the last decade, guided by its ACE “North Star,” the company has embraced many new scientific technologies that can be used as tools to improve understanding of feeds and feed management. As Alltech’s chief scientist, Dawson envisions the development of ways to naturally improve disease resistance, reproductive health and the overall comfort of livestock using new feeds, ingredients and more precise nutrient management practices. Connolly, ever mindful of connecting the dots between farm and table, anticipates increasing consumer demand for products that are clean, in keeping with their values, aspirations, ethics and expectations. “In fact, this fits with the ACE principle,” he noted. “Alltech’s development of new strategies to allow farmers to remove hormones from beef production, antibiotics of all types from the feed of poultry or pigs, to help reduce viral diseases or avoid parasitic challenges such as sea lice, all of these are animal-friendly, consumer-acceptable and don’t negatively affect the environment.” Read our entire ACE series: The Animal The Consumer The Environment","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/part-iv-ace-architecture-ideas","title":"\n\n                    Part IV - ACE: An architecture for ideas\n                    ","date":"November 30, 2017","contentLength":1841}},{"pageContent":"Being a part of the Alltech Young Scientist (AYS) program has been an incredible and unforgettable experience. I first got involved in research as an undergraduate studying food science and biochemistry, focusing on developing new analytical techniques for detecting antibiotics and other banned substances in food products. When my advisor suggested last year that I should submit my research paper to the competition, I never could have imagined what would come of it. The whole experience has been an amazing ride, and I know that it has had an enormous impact on all of the participants. I couldn’t believe my eyes when I first saw that I had been selected as a regional undergraduate finalist — it was a great honor to represent North America, and I looked forward to presenting my research and meeting the other regional finalists. When the global competition came, I headed to Kentucky with great anticipation. Meeting the incredibly talented scientists in the competition and learning about their areas of research could not have been more rewarding, and we all got an exciting up-close look at the innovative work that Alltech does to improve our agricultural systems. Winning the global competition was a once-in-a-lifetime experience that I will never forget. My time spent with the Alltech Young Scientist program has had an incalculable impact on my future plans and inspired me to work harder to help solve the problems that we face as a society.

Some of these ingredients claim improved digestive health and better stool quality, which is especially important to on-the-go urban pet parents living in small spaces — less mess to pick up. Today’s pet food choices are quite extensive, from specific breeds, sizes, life stages and activity levels to allergies and sensitivities. The choice overload can make the purchasing decision an intimidating task for some pet parents, especially for first-timers. How can we make choosing what to feed Fido easier? Let’s take a closer look at functional ingredients and why you might want to consider finding a food that contains them. Functional ingredients in pet nutrition Functional ingredients are ingredients that provide health benefits beyond basic nutrition, such as prebiotic fibers, beneficial probiotic bacteria, omega-3 fatty acids (DHA/EPA) and enriched selenium yeast. Why should I look for functional ingredients in a pet food label? Functional ingredients can provide health benefits when part of a complete and balanced diet. Prebiotics and probiotics have been reported to positively influence and maintain normal digestive health. The food you choose could cut time poop scooping The amount of pet waste correlates to the amount of indigestible content in the food. A healthy stool is moist and firm and has a mild smell. Prebiotics and probiotics in your pet’s food would help maintain normal digestion, minimizing issues that could create messy and smelly stools. What is that smell? Your pet’s waste is just residues from digestion. Bacteria decomposition and ammonia production occurs inside the intestine and then is released with the feces. Smell can be a challenge, particularly in confined spaces with poor ventilation. Yucca schidigera: The secret of the desert Yucca schidigera is a plant that grows in the southwestern deserts of the United States and Mexico. It has mainly been used for ammonia and odor control in livestock production, but it has application in pet foods that have high meat content because of its efficacy in helping metabolize protein and nitrogen. How do I know if my pet food contains functional ingredients? Ingredients are listed by the name required by the regulatory authorities. Here is an example of how some functional ingredients may be listed on the label: Beneficial probiotic bacteria (e.g.,Lactobacillus strains) Omega-3 fatty acids (DHA/EPA): Marine sources are best, such as fish oil and algae.

However, over the last decade, it has become increasingly clear that the complex community of microorganisms residing in the GI tract not only influences digestive processes but also significantly impacts long-term and short-term health. For optimum well-being, it is important to maintain an appropriate balance in the intestinal microflora. But what is that balance, and how we do we support it? Nutrition strategies for a balanced GI tract With the realization of the importance of microflora have come new nutritional strategies that influence microbial balance. Many are based on simple supplementation or diet changes, but their effects can be profound. These approaches are revolutionizing not only the way we view our gastrointestinal health, but also that of our animal companions. Digestive aids that include specific feed ingredients, exogenous enzymes, probiotics, organic acids and plant-derived oils can be coupled with nutritional management practices to beneficially manipulate intestinal microbial populations. One of the most successful documented uses has been supplementation with small doses of yeast-based polysaccharides (prebiotic fibers) to influence the composition of the gastrointestinal microbial population. We know that these supplementation strategies not only limit the proliferation of detrimental bacteria and pathogens, but are also associated with improved immune function and nutrient absorption. These approaches allow us to eat our way to improved health, but how exactly they work had not been understood…until recently. Feeding the good microbes: The science behind the nutrition revolution A nutritional revolution is at hand, with new tools for reliably demonstrating and predicting how dietary and supplementation approaches can influence the intestinal microflora and gastrointestinal health. Detailed nucleic acid sequencing techniques now allow for an in-depth description of the composition, profile and function of the most beneficial microbial populations in the intestinal tract. It is now possible to clearly pinpoint the effects of nutrition on the critical components of these complex populations and to determine the most effective balance of intestinal gut microbes. Rather than focusing on individual types of microorganisms, these techniques allow us to identify the optimal microbial populations that promote good intestinal health. This clarity takes the guess work out of diet formulation and can strategically improve health, from the most minuscule gut microbes to overall well-being.

To better prepare producers — both livestock and grain farms — for next year’s growing season, I had the chance to discuss managing mycotoxins from the field with Dr. Art Schaafsma, a researcher at the University of Guelph, Ridgetown Campus. Tell us a little bit about yourself and your work. My name is Dr. Art Schaafsma, and I am a researcher at the University of Guelph, Ridgetown Campus. I have a Ph.D. in crop protection and have been involved with field crop pest management at Ridgetown for just over 30 years. My main area of emphasis and research has been mycotoxins in both corn and wheat. I look at agronomic practices, sampling, detection and how to deal with mycotoxins along the value chain. Is there a way to mitigate the risk of mycotoxins from the field, whether during planting, growing or harvesting? If so, how? Mycotoxins are really complicated to manage, and it takes a multi-faceted approach and several tools to address them. The typical rotation after wheat is corn, and wheat does not seem to be as large a source of inoculum as corn is. This is seen often in minimum till and no-till systems, as there is a lot of corn residue left. Some pork producers use wheat as a way to manage mycotoxins. They will grow both corn and wheat and hope that one of those crops is clean and mix them if one is not as clean. They prefer corn, but if it is a bad year, then they will sell the wheat. Also, pay attention to hybrid selection and look for hybrids that are less susceptible to mycotoxins. You want to look for a hybrid that will mature on time, because if you push the hybrid, you can increase the risk of mycotoxins forming. In wheat, it is much the same when it comes to variety selection. During flowering in both corn and wheat is when the crop is most susceptible to the fungi that produce mycotoxins. In order to help combat this, producers should use a fungicide spray. The only group that is available are the triazoles to control Fusarium on both corn and wheat, and it is very important to get the timing right and get good coverage. In corn, it is important to control western bean cutworm and other pests that can contribute to furthering the risk of mycotoxin contamination. When it comes to harvest, some producers have started to take their wheat or corn off as soon as it can be taken off so that they can then dry it. This helps because they can control how fast the grain dries to stop the infection. During the growing season, what are some visible signs of mycotoxin contamination? In wheat, it is a bit easier to see the signs of deoxynivalenol (DON) because you look for head blight symptoms. These symptoms include the spikelets looking bleached. In corn, however, it is a bit more difficult, because there are a number of different species of Fusarium, and a lot don’t produce mycotoxins. The main mycotoxin we deal with is DON. You can tell if you have DON if you have white mold accompanied by a purple or pink color anywhere on the cob. It is always better to test the grain, especially if you see any pink or purple color or white mold. Green molds and black molds are not associated with mycotoxins. Many people worry about toxins increasing during storage; however, DON won’t increase if corn is stored below 18 percent moisture. However, this is when the mycotoxin zearalenone can be produced. Zearalenone is a late-season toxin, and there is an increased risk of zearalenone if the crop is late to harvest, stored incorrectly or not dried quickly enough. DON needs warm conditions to keep growing. Zearalenone can form under cooler and damper conditions. Are there certain types of mycotoxins that become more prevalent based on the type of growing season? For example, if it is a very wet year, do you see more DON versus in a dry year? Depending on the type of year you may be experiencing, you could get different types of mycotoxins contaminating your corn or wheat. For example, DON forms in a moderately warm temperature, with its optimum temperature being 28 degrees Celsius, and if there is a lot of rain, DON can become a big issue. Also, in August, when we sometimes get the foggy mornings and then the rest of the day is warm, DON can be an issue. DON is a complicated type of toxin and has several forms. Most producers tend to use an ELISA test to test for DON in their crops, but it only measures a few forms of DON, not all its forms. The other forms are just as toxic as DON. DON can sometimes also be masked or hidden. This happens when DON is conjugated with a sugar and is then overlooked by an ELISA test. This is why sometimes you may run an ELISA test, think there are no problems, then discover a mycotoxin. Fumonisin, another type of mycotoxin, shows up when there is heat stress, with low- to mid-30s degree Celsius weather and drought. In Ontario, we do not get this one too much because it isn’t hot and dry enough. Zearalenone does not show up in wheat because it is too warm during flowering, as wheat heads out in June or July. However, it does show up in corn in the fall. One toxin producers should be aware of is T-2 toxin. T-2 is related to a late harvest, and we find it regularly in corn that is left in the field too long and when corn lodges. The danger with this one is that it is 10 times more toxic than DON. Where do you think the next advancements will come from in reducing/protecting against Fusarium-produced mycotoxins? In corn, we are working on a sustainable way to manage western bean cutworm. I would like for there to be an incentive for farmers to grow less susceptible hybrids. This may happen soon because other end markets that buy a lot of corn are getting frustrated by mycotoxins as well. It is not just livestock producers that should be looking at their corn this way. More often now, there is a penalty applied for how much DON is brought into the processing plant. Awareness is growing and will lead us to change.

One is the neck rail. The purpose of the neck rail is that, when a cow stands up, the rail positions her so that it touches the top of her shoulder, guiding her to back up a couple of inches so she will defecate in the ally. The next important part of the free stall is the brisket locator. The brisket locator positions the cow so that she doesn’t lie down too far forward in the stall. When we measure stalls, we want to see stalls that are long and wide. Today, we have bigger cows, especially when we consider the Holstein breed. Our goal is to see stalls that, when measured from curb to curb, are between 17–18 feet wide to allow personal space for the cows. When measuring stall width, we measure what the cow feels. We do not measure from the center of the loop to the center of the next loop; we measure from inside to inside of the loop. With our bigger cows, we should be around 50 inches, not at 45 inches, which I see in many barns. For these larger cows, the neck rail should be around 50 inches high as well. Next, we want to avoid obstruction. Horizontal obstructions are often seen in older barns and affect the cow’s ability to get straight up and straight down. If we watch a cow out in the pasture as she gets up naturally, she rocks her head forward toward the ground, puts one front foot forward, planting herself to stand up straight. When obstructions are in their “rising,” they will do everything they can to use the valuable inches of space. I like to say that cows know geometry — they figure out how to use angles in the stall to get the most use out of the space they are provided. If the stall is too narrow, or too short, the cow will naturally angle herself in the stall. If we see cows standing with two feet in the stall and two feet out of the stall, we call that “perching,” and this is not good. We want the cows to come into the stall and lie down immediately. We want them off their feet because these are 1,400- to 1,600-pound animals. They should be comfortable and lying down because more blood is pumped through the udder to make milk when they are lying down versus standing up. Cow comfort When considering stall design, we need to be sure to look directly at the cows themselves. When you look at a cow, you want to see a very nice set of feet and legs. While in the parlor, if I see swollen hocks, skinned hocks or injuries on the inside of the leg of the animal, that tells me that the stalls are too short and too narrow and the type of surface that the cow is lying on may be having a negative effect on her legs. Consider yourself: If you’re in a hotel and the bed is not comfortable, what do you do? You toss and you turn. When a 1,400- to 1,600-pound animal is not comfortable in the stall, she is moving her legs, tossing and turning in the stall, leading to swollen and skinned hocks. When we see an injury on the inside of the leg, that tells me that the stall is too short and her leg is hanging over the curb. These are very important aspects of cow comfort that we can observe in the parlor before we even look at the cow in the free stalls. Water quality When we talk about overall milk quality and cow comfort, another critical component is water. Over 87 percent of milk composition is water. When I am looking at the stalls, I also spend time examining the waterers. Are the waterers clean and scrubbed? Are we doing a good job of protecting the waterers? I always like to see a high rail around the water so cows can’t jump up and put their feet in the waterer. We want the distance between the edge of the water and the edge of the wall to be over 12 feet so the “big boss” cows can be drinking water and other cows can go around behind them to eat and lie down. Plenty of clean water is very important, and it must be enough for the number of cows. Cows can consume between 30–50 gallons of water per day. Providing enough available space of water for the number of cows, approximately 3 feet of available water area per 10–15 cows, is important to milk production. Air quality Air quality, or the movement of air over the cows, is another very important part of cow comfort in a free stall building, a cross-ventilated building and a natural-ventilated building. When measuring stalls, I check what the wind speed is, or how good the air quality is moving through the building. Smoke is a great tool for showing the air movement through the building, but cows do not like smoke and can smell it up to 5 miles away. So, instead of smoke, I go to my grandkids’ toy box and find a little bubble machine. This little bubble machine gives me a good indication of which way and how fast the airflow is moving in the building. Plus, the curious cows seem amused by the bubbles!","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/designing-dairy-free-stalls-cow-comfort","title":"\n\n                    Designing dairy free stalls for cow comfort\n                    ","date":"December 5, 2017","contentLength":925}},{"pageContent":"Seafood is rich in many of the essential nutrients that we must consume regularly to maintain a healthy life. In order for fish and shrimp to reach their full genetic and nutritional potential, it is important that they receive the right minerals. Organic trace minerals can not only positively impact animal health and performance, but producer profitability, the environment and the food on our dinner tables. Health and performance Organic trace minerals are more bioavailable than inorganic trace minerals, meaning that they are better absorbed, stored and utilized by the animal. A fish that is healthy and performing optimally leads to a stronger and more robust animal that is less vulnerable to stress throughout the entire production cycle. The modern management of mineral nutrition can be accomplished with organic trace minerals at significantly lower levels than inorganic trace minerals while still improving fish performance and reducing mineral excretion into the environment. We call this innovation Total Replacement Technology™. Our highly bioavailable trace minerals Bioplex® and Sel-Plex® (zinc, manganese, copper, iron and cobalt*) play vital roles in supporting fish immunity, encouraging growth and supporting reproduction. In research conducted with Trakia University and the fish farm Nomicom in Bulgaria, it was observed that Bioplex® provided a considerable increase in weight gain and a decrease in feed conversion ratio. These results indicate that the use of Bioplex minerals in fish feed formulations have a positive impact on feed efficiency, which results in higher profitability for the farmer. Water quality The importance of bioavailable minerals extends beyond animal health and performance and into the environment. If minerals are not properly utilized within the animal, they will be lost to the environment, negatively impacting the water quality on the farm. Recent trials have focused on the use of Alltech’s Aquate® premix, which contains Bioplex trace minerals, in fish feed diets. These minerals are chelated to organic molecules, which have been shown to interact less with each other in the digestive tract and are also less sensitive to the inhibitory action of other compounds because of their reduced solubility in water, therefore improving digestion. Because these minerals dissolve less in water than other types of minerals, it is easy to filter them out, keeping water fresh. Tastier, more sustainable fish Understanding how a fish responds to nutrition on the genetic level can increase animal health and welfare while also helping the animal to meet its full genetic potential. This results in more efficient production through nutritional programming for tastier, more nutritious fish. By producers bringing improved nutrition to the table, consumers reap the benefits of a functional food that bridges the gap between what is on their plate and their health. Additionally, the Alltech® Mineral Management program and our Total Replacement Technology ensure that the mineral needs of all cultured aqua species are met in the most efficient manner. By utilizing precision nutrition to minimize waste, we can support producers in the challenge of feeding a growing world while preserving our resources for the next generation. I want to learn more about aquaculture nutrition.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/seafood-thought-importance-organic-trace-minerals-aquaculture","title":"\n\n                    (Sea)food for thought: The importance of organic trace minerals in aquaculture\n                    ","date":"October 17, 2017","contentLength":510}},{"pageContent":"There is only so much arable land on planet Earth. Only so much water. But people are plentiful and becoming increasingly so, year after year. And people must eat to survive. So how are we humans doing on the matter of feeding ourselves? The World Health Organization has set the bar high, defining food security as “a situation when all people at all times have physical and economic access to sufficient and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preference for an active and healthy life.” We do not live in that perfect world. The global population is on track to swell from the present 7 billion to nearly 10 billion people in the next 30 years, according to the United Nations (U.N.). And if World Bank projections are on target, Earth’s population will have doubled by 2080. According to the most recent update (2015) of U.N. population data, most of the world (60 percent of the global population) lives in Asia, 16 percent in Africa, 10 percent in Europe, 9 percent in Latin America and the Caribbean, and the remaining 5 percent in North America and Oceania (Micronesia, Fiji and all of Polynesia). China and India remain the two largest countries of the world, each with more than 1 billion people, representing 19 and 18 percent of the world’s population, respectively. With such demographics to consider against the backdrop of finite natural resources, the security of a sustainable global food supply is challenging researchers and planners to map long-term strategies. Agricultural production will have to increase significantly in order to meet the growing need. Can it be done safely and sustainably? Food price volatility will somehow have to be brought under control — a tall order in a world of competing (even warring) nations and economies contending with increasing demand from finite resources. Without agricultural innovation, half of the population could be undernourished by 2050 Those concerns, as pressing as they are, may pale in comparison, however, with the uncertainty and disruption brought on by climate change. “Under a no-climate change scenario, based upon projected changes in population and agricultural land use only, 31 percent (2.5 billion people by 2050) of the global population is at risk of undernourishment if no adaptation or agricultural innovation is made in the intervening years,” according to projections cited in the report “Modelling Impacts of Climate Change on Global Food Security” by a team of researchers at the University of Dundee in Scotland and the University of Southampton and the University of Reading in England. “An additional 21 percent (1.7 billion people) is at risk of undernourishment by 2050 when climate change is taken into account,” the report states. A young girl in Kolminy, Haiti, eats peanut butter bread given to her by missionaries. Credit: Michelle D. Milliman / Shutterstock.com The researchers concede that their projections do not take into account future trends in technology, improved crop varieties or agricultural trade interventions, “although it is clear that all of these adaptation strategies will need to be embraced on a global scale if society is to ensure adequate food supplies for a projected global population of greater than 9 billion people.” Important solutions might arrive through technological innovation. But there are other key factors to consider. “There are lots of things that technology can do, but there are also global political and cultural systems coming into play all the time,” said Dr. Karl Dawson, Alltech’s chief scientific officer. “It’s not something a single scientific breakthrough is going to solve.” Literal food security in the face of terrorism The term “food security” becomes very literal in the context of the rise of terrorism around the world today. Since the attacks on the World Trade Center in New York on Sept.11, 2001, for example, the U.S. Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) has stepped up efforts to protect America's supply of meat, poultry and egg products from intentional or unintentional contamination. FSIS inspectors have remained on heightened alert to detect unusual or suspicious activity, reinspecting imported meat and poultry products before they are allowed to enter the U.S. food supply. It’s no small irony that food insecurity can act as a catalyst for conditions that lead to terrorism, according to a report by the World Food Programme. China’s rising middle class and diminishing arable land In addition to changes in climate and social and political instability, one factor looms large: China. Shoppers fill Nanjing Road in Shanghai. Credit: TonyV3112 / Shutterstock.com Although China's agricultural output is the largest in the world, only about 15 percent of its total land area can be cultivated. “In a quest for rapid economic growth, and the global economy’s insatiable desire for the supply of cheap Chinese goods, China has displayed agricultural negligence — with ramifications yet to be determined, but likely to serve as a catalyst in food security negotiations,” writes the World Policy Journal’s Keshar Patel. The Chinese ministries of Environmental Protection and Land and Resources issued a national bulletin on soil pollution in 2014 stating that one-fifth of Chinese soil is fallow, “a consequence of exposure to heavy metal contaminants.” The statement described the soil and environmental problems as serious. This reality collides with another: China’s overall food supply, while growing, is not rising fast enough to keep up with demand. “The key long-term food security challenge in China remains the steady growth in protein consumption (fueled by urbanization and an expanding middle class),” said Michael Woolsey, senior strategic manager for Alltech China. “This situation explains much of the sharp rise in beef, pork and dairy imports in the past decade,” he continued. “China can close this gap by improving productivity, as Chinese agricultural productivity remains well below global leaders in key industries.” Woolsey noted that China’s corn yields per hectare are half the levels in the U.S. and Brazil. Dairy output per cow is 40 percent the dairy output in Wisconsin. Average piglets per sow per year are reportedly around 15, roughly half the level in the European Union. Chinese imports of wheat have doubled in recent years, as Chinese grain self-sufficiency has drastically decreased. And after years of negotiations, notes USA Today, “China has agreed to open its domestic market for U.S. rice exports for the first time ever, acknowledging its need for foreign shipments to meet the growing demands of its vast middle class.” Rice terraces were built into the hillsides of Gullin, China, during the Yuan Dynasty (1271 - 1368). Servicing that demand has prompted the Chinese government to start leasing farms in North and South America, Australia and Africa. And in some cases, it has bought the land outright, according to Patel. Water is also at a premium in China. “Rice is an aquatic crop, a water and labor hog, demanding twice as much labor and water as any other row crop in Asia,” reports Forbes. “In China alone, rice consumes about 70 percent of the nation’s irrigated water.” Spread the tech to places where it’s needed “So much of our focus is on high-input agriculture in the U.S. and South America and other parts of the world, but the U.N. estimates that about 60 percent of our food comes from peasant agriculture in low-income countries,” said University of Kentucky agricultural economist Lee Meyer. “That area has seen substantial growth in food output, but there is so much more potential there.” Key to enabling those countries to meet their food output potentials, asserts Dawson, is finding ways to democratize technologies. “Getting technology uniformly distributed around the world so we can have an efficient food production system is very important,” he said. “We have the technologies, and we do a lot to develop new technologies, but I’m concerned about educating the world about what those technologies can do and then implementing those technologies.” Improved feed, feed efficiency, seed genetics, animal genetics and on-farm technical capacity are all key to improving Chinese agricultural productivity, according to Woolsey. Alltech’s range of animal nutrition solutions and technical assistance are helping Chinese producers close the productivity gap, he said. Alltech partnered with Nestlé in opening a Dairy Farming Insititute in Shuangcheng, Heilongjiang province, China, to help train Chinese dairy farmers. Dawson, as Alltech’s chief scientist, has for years concentrated on the study of such solutions, with a focus on nutrigenomics, the science of understanding nutrition’s impact at the genetic level. This work has resulted in the development of new tools for understanding precisely how nutrients function, why different forms of nutrients have different effects and how such nutrients can be optimized for health. “It’s providing us with a very basic toolset that allows us to look at production efficiencies, animal health and the overall effectiveness of food production systems,” he said. “It’s not going to solve all of the problems, but it provides us with a way of evaluating new management strategies and techniques and feeding strategies that we never had before.” Raising fish on land Fish farming holds tremendous promise in responding to surging demand for food that is taking place due to global population growth, according to a report by the U.N.’s Food and Agriculture Organization. This has led to a rapid expansion of the aquaculture industry in recent years, and with it, increased water pollution. The search for ways to prevent contamination has resulted in the development of land-based farms known as recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS). RAS systems consist of tanks, water filtration units and, usually, degassing and oxygenation. For warm water species, the water is heated as well. This reconditioned water can be recirculated and reused. “These systems were developed to become less dependent on water sources and climates. Now you can farm almost anywhere with these advantages,” said Gijs Rutjes, technical sales support manager at Coppens International, the Dutch fish feed producer that joined the Alltech family of companies in 2016. “Closed systems score much better. They have no escapees, the feces are collected and removed, and the nitrogen and phosphorus output is reduced due to filtration units in closed RAS systems,” Rutjes said. Closed, recirculating aquaculture systems, such as the Marine Harvest one shown here, improve efficiency of production and reduce environmental impact. Salmon farms have started to move more of their production on land for this purpose. “There’s a lot of investment in these systems in the Scandinavian countries,” said Dawson. “They’re becoming important, particularly in the area of environmental impact. There is a complete re-use of water; capturing carbon dioxide and recirculating heat to generate power. It gives a whole new meaning to what it takes to build a biological protein.” Food waste: A paradox of plenty Perhaps most confounding for a world in search of ways to feed an expanding human population is waste. Countries that have more food also waste more food, according to YieldWise, a seven-year, $130 million Rockefeller Foundation initiative to demonstrate how food loss and waste can be cut in half globally. “About a third of total food is wasted or at least doesn’t make it from the farm to final consumption,” noted Meyer. That’s enough to feed everyone in the world for two months, according to the YieldWise initiative. The effort’s initial focus is on fruits, vegetables and staple crops in Kenya, Nigeria and Tanzania, where up to half of all food grown is lost. Begging for brains: New talent needed for agricultural innovation The status of global food security is subject to many influences, including the unpredictable. One thing is certain: The planet needs very smart people to carry on the evolution of present technologies and to envision entirely new and innovative solutions to these vexing issues. While perhaps not for everyone, the broad field of agriculture is begging for talent. “Oh, absolutely,” acknowledged Meyer. “In the College of Agriculture, we are the applied nature to so many of the sciences. There are programs in biotechnology, agricultural engineering, agricultural economics, international development, food policy. There are really rewarding ways to apply a good education in this whole area of food production and food security.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/feast-or-famine-facing-future-food-security","title":"\n\n                    Feast or famine?: Facing the future of food security\n                    ","date":"October 27, 2017","contentLength":2049}},{"pageContent":"Documenting trends is the closest thing in business to peering into a crystal ball. When it comes to consumer food trends, a dizzying variety of surveys from around the world readily fill pages upon pages of a Google search. But which trends are long-term and which are just passing fads? What are shoppers really thinking? What’s influencing or impacting their behaviors? And what’s driving their purchases? A particular pair of studies stands out for depth of insight for those along the food chain whose job it is to tweak strategic consumer marketing plans. PERIscope 2017 is a biennial, large-scale quantitative study launched in 2001 by Bord Bia, the Irish Food Board. Based on interviews with 1,000 consumers in each of eight countries, the study identifies major shifts in consumer attitudes over time. The eight markets include Ireland and Great Britain, four continental European Union markets, as well as the U.S. and China. The study explores consumer attitudes about eating at home, cooking, local food, the environment, and health and well-being. A second survey taps into the consumer food trend perceptions of more than 1,700 registered dietitians (RDs). What’s Trending in Nutrition, an annual survey produced in partnership between Pollock Communications and Today’s Dietitian magazine, covers bases ranging from shifting attitudes to favored resources and much in between. Here are some of the highlights featured in each. A source of tension Among the standout trends of 2017 illuminated in the eight-nation PERIscope survey is a tension between the desire for “new” versus the comfort of tradition. “We know that across all markets, consumers are placing more importance on spending time as a family over meals, enjoying cooking more and increasingly hosting dinner parties, all indicating people’s desire to balance modern life with tradition,” said David Deeley, a member of Bord Bia’s consumer and market insight team. Among the countries surveyed for PERIscope, China, followed by Spain, leads in striving to balance modernization and tradition. The U.K. is ranked 7th and the Netherlands dead last in this category. This finding is supported by the Today’s Dietitian survey, which attributes the latest shift in consumer food perceptions to a slower and more thoughtful approach to eating. Keep it real When it comes to authenticity, noted PERIscope’s Deeley, “consumers are tired of uniform, impersonal, throw-away products and the invisible nature of global supply chains. They crave stronger connections with the brands they buy, increasingly seeking out authentic and storied products that tell their brand story in an interesting and resonating way.” What’s the story behind the story? The demand for transparency is as strong as ever. The PERIscope survey finds consumers continuing to challenge producers to provide the full details about their food products. Labeling and quality symbols are a major point of interest for many countries, especially in China, where many people have lost faith in the safety of produce. Provenance and quality matter. In Ireland, 78 percent of food shoppers check for country of origin, while checking for quality symbols stands at 75 percent, up by 20 percent since 2001. In the U.S., almost 7 in 10 people claim to check for country of origin, while 67 percent of consumers check for a symbol or certificate that guarantees the quality of the produce, according to the survey. Registered dietitians responding to the Today’s Dietitian poll indicate that GMO-free and sustainable foods have experienced on average a 20 percent decrease in terms of what concerns consumers. “Dietitians attribute this decline to food label transparency and more food companies changing their ingredient deck,” the report said. And 59 percent of dietitians said consumers are choosing to \"eat clean,” selecting foods that are less processed as well as more whole foods, such as veggies, fruits, ancient grains and green tea. Plant-based proteins like nuts and seeds also figure more prominently in diets. Make it lasting and environmentally friendly Smart devices deliver a mind-boggling amount of information about brand practices, processes and procedures. The result? “Consumers are calling out inappropriate, bland or opaque brand behavior and are sharing it with their peers,” observed Deeley. The PERIscope study finds that consumers prefer to buy from companies that are aware of environmental issues and the value of sustainability. “We also know that they’re increasingly more aware of terms like ‘food waste’ and ‘sustainably produced' in countries like Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, where awareness of both tops 90 percent,” he said. Across all eight markets, the survey shows that consumers are adopting a greener mindset and are increasingly drawn to eco-friendly businesses and practices. Deeley’s suggestion to food producers and processors: “Recycling, upcycling, downcycling, zero waste — it doesn’t matter what you call it. Just be sure that you adopt a green mindset and eliminate any negative environmental impact your products and services may directly or indirectly cause before, during and after production — this includes the entire consumption cycle, too.” Localism lives on With a growing number of adults turning toward the local and the familiar, the emergence of the “locavore” is becoming ever more pervasive, according to the PERIscope 2017 survey. “Local food for consumers means food that is better quality and is transparent in its production processes,” said Deeley. “A growing number are looking closer to home for groceries, and more and more are seeing the importance of purchasing from their local communities. This trend holds true across most countries, with the French placing the most importance on buying local foods (79 percent).” China (76 percent) and Spain (75 percent), Ireland (67 percent), Germany (64 percent) and the U.S. (60 percent) are warming to the concept. Consumers in Great Britain (55 percent) and the Netherlands (35 percent) are the least interested in seeking out specifically local food sources. Make it quick — but good Demand for foods that are quick to prepare has been on the rise. Pre-portioned meal delivery services such as Blue Apron, HelloFresh and FreshDirect have skyrocketed, with 45 percent of consumers now turning to these and similar healthy meal or weight loss menu delivery programs in order to eat healthier, according to the Today’s Dietitian survey. “In Ireland, this figure rose from 56 percent in 2001 to almost 7 in 10 (69 percent) in 2017,” according to PERIscope’s Deeley. “The majority of Americans have a tendency to pick foods that are easy to prepare (91 percent) and quick to cook (85 percent). More than 7 in 10 people claim to eat convenience or ready-prepared meals regularly.” In an observation worthy of the attention of food labelers, Deeley noted some uncertainty about which foods are healthy, “with close to half of those polled claiming to be confused about the health benefits of particular foods and 60 percent saying nutritional claims and food labels are hard to understand.” Keep it interesting More than 7 in 10 consumers in all eight countries of the PERIscope survey claim they like to try new foods. An increasingly wider variety of foods is available in today’s markets, making it is easier for consumers to explore foods from around the world. And there’s China again, leading this time in adventurous eating, with 96 percent saying they like to try new foods. And once again, the Chinese are trailed closely by Spanish consumers in an open-mindedness about new foods (94 percent), while the French (81 percent) and Irish (74 percent) are more likely to stick with what they know. There are apps for that When it comes to technology, Chinese consumers are far ahead of their counterparts in the seven other countries surveyed by PERIscope in 2017. Asked if they have ever downloaded a food app, 76 percent of Chinese consumers responded that they have. The next closest are Americans at 34 percent, with only 19 percent of Irish and 18 percent of consumers in the U.K. poking at food icons on their smart devices. What is influencing consumer perception? The survey of dietitians looked at the sources of consumer nutrition information. Most (73 percent) said consumers rely on blogs and websites, followed by social media (70 percent). Fifty-eight percent turn to television and radio for most of their information. The survey also reveals a paradox by asking where consumers get the most nutrition misinformation. Seventy-seven percent cited social media, 67 percent pointed to blogs and websites, and 63 percent said celebrities often get it wrong (a change from 2016, when celebrities were believed to be more misleading than social media). Consumers gauge their health and weight, according to the dietitians, by comparing themselves to people in magazines or on television (72 percent), friends/family members (64 percent) or people on social media (57 percent). Food consumers in China are far more likely than those in the other seven countries of the PERIscope survey to share recipes via social media — 77 percent of Chinese respondents versus the next highest social media users, Americans at 41 percent. Where are registered dietitians sourcing their own information? According to the Today’s Dietitian survey, most (80 percent) of RDs have bookmarked the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s MyPlate website for nutrition education. Sixty-five percent include the published resources of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics among their tools. What leaps off the page “For me, the most interesting story is revealed when we look back at the 2001 report and track the changes over time,” said Deeley. “The world was certainly a very different place, and that is reflected in those reports. Today, we know that health and well-being have changed dramatically over time, with people now making more conscious decisions to enjoy a holistic approach to physical health and emotional well-being.” Although dietitians say consumer awareness of healthy food has increased and mindful eating is on the rise in 2017, they note that issues of access and cost continue to prevent certain populations from being able to eat and purchase healthy food. “For low-income consumers, RDs say that cost, above all other factors including physical health, is the largest barrier when making food purchasing decisions,” suggests the Today’s Dietitian study. “This often makes healthy eating options out of reach for low-income families. RDs recommend increasing affordability and availability of nutritious food in low-income areas to help reduce barriers to healthy eating.” The polling for what’s hot and what’s not in 2018 is underway. It will be interesting to see how these trends persist, shift or change altogether in the coming year.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/what-are-they-thinking","title":"\n\n                    What are they thinking?\n                    ","date":"October 20, 2017","contentLength":1775}},{"pageContent":"The Alltech Coppens Aqua Centre recently opened its doors following extensive investment to establish it as a “global hub of excellence for aqua research.” The center is ideally located for aquaculture research in Valkenswaard, the Netherlands, which has a rich aquaculture history. It was there that, at the beginning of the 20th century, two Dutch entrepreneurs, the mayor of Valkenswaard and Baron van Tuyll van Serooskerken, began to build ponds specifically for fish farming. These ponds mostly contained carp. A few decades later, a company called Heidemij (later Arcadis) began producing fish there, and during the 1940s, other fish were introduced specifically for the growing angling market in the Netherlands. During the 1950s, the Organization for the Improvement of Inland Fisheries (OVB) produced fish in Valkenswaard for the purposes of restocking inland waters in the Netherlands. After OVB discontinued their efforts in 2002, Valkenswaard returned to commercial aquaculture activities with the production of ornamental fish by Viskweekcentrum Valkenswaard BV and research and development carried out by the Coppens Research Centre. Valkenswaard so thoroughly established itself as an aquaculture center that it even has a species of carp named in its honor! De Valkenswaardse spiegelkarper, or the Valkenswaard mirror carp, has scales resembling small mirrors and can grow to be more than 60 pounds. For more than a century, Valkenswaard has been central to Dutch aquaculture.

Crop nutritional management will be a key aspect of the second Green Revolution, which is looking to technology and sustainable practices to help make crop production more efficient — to get more out of less. Throughout the world, the potato represents a major food source, with annual global production estimated at approximately 325 million tons and consumption at approximately 33 kilograms per head per year (Food and Agriculture Organization, 2012). Nutritional interventions have been shown to play a considerable role in crop productivity by helping to alleviate the common biotic and abiotic challenges encountered in-field, challenges which frequently result in reduced harvest yields. The response of two key potato cultivars grown in commercial settings — Rooster (floury-textured, all-purpose potato) and Maris Piper (high dry matter potato, ideal for chipping) — to an Alltech Crop Science (ACS)-recommended program was investigated. Tuber yield and uniformity was assessed for plots treated with Soil-Set® (2 liters/hectare) at planting and Impro-Set® (1 liter/hectare) at early and late tuber fill. The trial was carried out in replicate 38-square-meter plots, each with approximately 140 plants per plot, in a commercial farm on the eastern coast of Ireland during the 2016 growing season. The combined data for both potato varieties revealed notable improvements in overall yield and relative size distribution with the ACS-recommended program (see graph below). On average, treatment resulted in a 5.9 percent increase in total yield, which equated to approximately 2.7 tons/hectare under these conditions. Perhaps more interestingly, the relative size distribution of tubers was significantly improved in the desired marketable category (p≤0.05). Reductions of small and oversized tubers in response to treatment coincided with a relative 8.2 percent increase in these 45- to 70-millimeter tubers, equating to an additional 5.9 tons/hectare for this category. As demonstrated in this study, improved yields and more consistent tuber uniformity across two potato varieties demonstrate the potential benefits of incorporating the ACS program into a commercial potato growing system.

Diseases can be caused by a variety of factors, such as environmental stressors, reactions to various fertilizers or herbicides, nutritional deficiencies or soil problems. Therefore, it can be difficult to pinpoint the cause of the disease and determine an appropriate treatment. When scouting your crops for disease, pay particular attention to these three plant parts: 1. Examine the roots “Windshield scouting” while driving the fields doesn’t work because disease is not always easily visible to the human eye. To ensure you are catching any sign of disease before it progresses, it is important to get into the field and dig up a few plants to examine the roots. Look for unhealthy roots that may have lesions. To get a better look, try washing the roots with water and then cutting them up the middle to examine for any sign of internal infection. 2. Examine the leaves Especially during flowering, make sure to look at the leaves and sheaths on each plant. Pay attention to lesions, which will help you determine the amount of leaf infection. 3. Examine the stem and heads When examining the stems, heads and pods of plants, be sure to split them apart for a closer look at the inside, observing any discoloration that could be caused by fungi or bacteria. Also, check the outside of the stems, heads and pods of the plants for signs of fungal material or lesions. Scouting for disease is critical to ensure early intervention. Samples should be taken of all suspect crops and submitted to a trusted lab, such as Quantum Genetix, that can test for disease.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/3-tips-scouting-your-crops-disease","title":"\n\n                    3 tips for scouting your crops for disease\n                    ","date":"","contentLength":289}},{"pageContent":"Pearse and Deirdre Lyons could not have known when they met decades ago as teens at a Dublin rugby club dance that they would one day find themselves driving around the streets of a section of the Irish capital known as the Liberties in search of just the right place to house their legacy. This quest was not about Alltech, the global animal health and nutrition company they had founded and nurtured to remarkable success. This was personal. The story, one animated by shared imagination and powerful determination to overcome all manner of obstacles, is expressed in the location, history and reincarnation of a deconsecrated church that had known better days. And who better to relate the story of Pearse Lyons Distillery at St. James than the Lyonses themselves? Photo Credit: Conor McCabe Photography Ltd Locating their legacy Pearse recalled the day he and his wife Deirdre explored the Liberties district, one of Dublin’s most historic neighborhoods that had once hosted dozens of breweries and distilleries. “I wanted something in Dublin, and I wanted something that would be close to Guinness for the simple reason that 1.6 million people visit Guinness every year,” he explained. “I’m a businessman, and I thought, ‘Okay, I need someplace close to the 1.6 million people.’ So I was looking in that vicinity.” “It just so happened that we were driving down James’s Street,” said Deirdre. “This is the area where Pearse’s father and grandfather and his grandfather before him all grew up. Pearse's very first job was at Irish Distillers, which was, at that time Paddy, Powers and Jameson whiskey.” They came upon St. James, a church that had been built before the signing of the Magna Carta. In the last century, it had been repurposed as a warehouse and a store, but it was sitting abandoned. Pearse saw past its state of disrepair and envisioned the opportunity as real estate just steps away from Guinness. He bought it. Was there hope in this forsaken place? “My first thought was, ‘Oh, no!’” said Deirdre. “When we walked in, I couldn’t believe it.” It was bad. Very bad. “The roof was leaking in many places,” she said. “We had all kinds of water damage, plaster damage and neglect. The beautiful stone columns that had come from Caen in Normandy were painted magenta. Where the beautiful ceiling is now, previous owners had hacked out the stone on each side and put in steel beams and a staircase for a mezzanine and above that, another mezzanine. All the windows were blocked up with cement blocks, both inside and outside.” Additionally, they soon discovered that a buddleia, or butterfly bush, had started to grow from the top of the church. It was so powerful that the roots had come down and broken through a wall 9 feet thick. At this point, many would likely begin having serious second thoughts. The Lyonses instead prepared themselves to move forward with the project. A new classification creates complications A major twist in the plot occurred when, only two weeks after the purchase, they were informed that the old church was to become a national monument. This new designation began a multi-year, multi-million euro excursion through a sea of time-consuming, costly renovation and restoration work. “We had to remove all of the plaster,” said Deirdre. “We had to then build it back with new plaster, but the new plaster had to be of the 18th century-style. So that meant it had to be a lime plaster with a rough finish.” Since it can take up to six years for lime plaster to completely dry, a special and very rare silicate paint would be required — and there are only three on the planet. “One of them happened to be in Ireland!” said Deirdre. “I wanted this warm, buttery yellow, like a glowing ‘wrap itself around you’ feel. The Irish firm had five or six shades of white. So we said no. The next one was in Slovenia. They sent samples that were very yellow. Unfortunately, 48 hours after their paint was tested, it changed color. So we did more research and found a German company called Keim. They do a lot of restoration of historical buildings, particularly with the paints that were used in medieval times, which were very muted colors. That worked perfectly.” But no sooner had the paint issue been solved then another challenge arose. The old church had long ago lost its spire. So Deirdre turned her attention to its replacement. “There had been no spire on the church since 1954,” she explained. “It had been struck by lightning, and it became dangerous, so it was taken down.” Deirdre presented ideas for a new slate, copper or stone spire, but every idea was rejected by city officials. But, said Pearse, “Deirdre doesn’t compromise. She was going to do something spectacular. She knew what she was doing, and she would not take any shortcuts. It took them a while to realize that this was a woman for whom it wasn’t money; this was a passion.” Deirdre has a fondness for glass and came up with a concept for a glass spire that could be lighted at night. That idea was rejected. “I was so frustrated at this point with everything that was rejected that I sought out a meeting with the city officials,” she said. “We shared our drawings, and they found them to be unique and exciting. Since we didn’t hear anything negative, we went ahead and created the spire.” Deirdre’s vision for the interior called for custom-made stained glass windows decorated with depictions of the brewing, distilling and coopering that had been so characteristic of the Liberties. “We presented the renders for the stained glass windows, but they were rejected on the premise that it had been a Protestant church, which would not have had stained glass,” she said. To move forward with the stained glass windows, the Lyonses were invited to prove that they couldn’t be read from the outside of the church. Deirdre took this as a go-ahead to produce one of the windows and install it, since it would be the only way to test it. “We created the south window first, which explains the brewing process,” said Deirdre. “It took a long time to sketch it and go to the glass company, a little two-person company way up in the north, pick out all the glass and lay the glass the way we wanted — because we wanted to use all of the colors that would be associated with the industry, like gold, amber, copper, some black and some warm browns and yet put them in a way that was very easy to read.” Photo Credit: Donal Murphy Once they installed the window, they invited the planners and zoners to come see it. After opportunity for review, Deirdre decided to proceed to the next window. However, when the concrete blocks were removed, a couple small lattice pieces were discovered. Because the lattice pieces were original, the window could no longer be removed. “We had to create our window and put it on what I call a ‘goal post frame’ and float it off the window,” said Deirdre. Photo Credit: Donal Murphy Classic copper pot stills, custom-made for the distillery by the Vendome Copper & Brass Works in Louisville, Kentucky, were transferred from their County Carlow location to the site. With the attempted move, an entirely new round of frustration gripped the project. “We were a quarter of an inch shy of getting them through the biggest door,” said Deirdre. “We could take the door off, but we couldn’t remove the arch because we were afraid that the stone would not be able to support itself.” But, where there’s a will, there’s a way. Workers were in the process of reinforcing and replacing the building’s roof. “We got everything structurally right and then we left one section of the roof open,” said Deirdre. “We had a crane lift them in.” Photo Credit: Donal Murphy A legacy project becomes an ancestral tribute Excavation to make room for the building’s new mechanical systems yielded yet another surprise. This one, at least, brought with it a most amazing serendipity. “We soon unearthed bodies that we hadn’t expected at all,” said Deirdre. “In those days, graves were dug very deeply, and bodies were placed on top of bodies.” An on-site archeologist oversaw a careful process each time a body was discovered. Each one was carefully taken to the National Museum of Ireland – Archaeology, where it was examined, dated and photographed. The bones would then be returned to rest at St. James. “To accommodate all those bones, we actually had to create crypts under the floor of the church,” said Deirdre. “There were two crypts already in the church, but we had to put in five more.” Then, there was a startling discovery. Among those buried in the centuries-old church graveyard was none other than John Hubert Lyons, grandfather of Pearse. The revelation unlocked something long hidden in the recesses of his memory. “At age 4, my earliest recollection is of going to a funeral, an Irish wake,” he explained. “I saw this person, and I remember them saying it was my grandfather.” The year was 1948. “His parents were on holiday in France and had distributed all of the little ones to various aunts and uncles in the area,” related Deirdre. “So, Pearse and his older brother were taken in a horse-drawn carriage with the hearse. But he never knew that it was a funeral until he grew up. He was too young. It was hushed up. It all flooded back when we realized this. That then made it very important to Pearse.” This personal commitment would prove critical as myriad obstacles continued to mount. For example, the Lyonses would present 17 renderings of a proposed visitors center before a plan would finally be approved. Breathing life into the Liberties Pearse hopes the beautifully restored distillery’s presence and energy breathes new life into the neighborhood. “When you put a beautiful place up, people tend to step up,” said Pearse. “There are going to be a lot of refurbishments. I hope we’re alive to see it.” “I have to say that, even though it was probably the most challenging job I’ve ever done, it’s also been the most rewarding,” said Deirdre as she reflected. “The builders said that they loved working with Deirdre because she never changed her mind. Never,” said Pearse. “She has the vision of what she wants to do. I think this is what makes us a formidable team. It’s telling our story. It’s history.”","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/pearse-lyons-distillery-inside-story-legacy","title":"\n\n                    Pearse Lyons Distillery: The inside story of a legacy\n                    ","date":"August 31, 2017","contentLength":1811}},{"pageContent":"How does Dan Donavan of Murphy and Sons increase yields and improve the quality of his tomatoes which are destined for restaurants like Subway, and What-A-Burger?

They are becoming a popular crop input in many countries around the world for several reasons. Benefits to using biostimulants on your farm 1. Biostimulants assist in combating the effects of environmental stresses. Biostimulants promote enhanced germination and root development, leading to increased vigor and greater stress resistance. An enhanced root system promotes more efficient nutrient and water uptake and translocation throughout the growing season. 2. Biostimulants increase grain fill and quality. Promoting growth and improvinga plant’s metabolism can benefit overall plant growth and health. In addition, providing a catalyst at specific developmental stages can lead to increased yield, improved uniformity and overall crop quality. 3. Biostimulants encourage plant growth. Biostimulants generally operate through different mechanisms than standard fertilizers and provide essential nutrients for plant metabolism that stimulate plant growth. These metabolic pathways upregulate gene expression that can have an effect on cell division and sizing, root and shoot growth, and reproductive development and timing. Your agronomist or crop advisor can give you more information on incorporating biostimulants into your current crop management program.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/why-use-biostimulants","title":"\n\n                    Why use biostimulants?\n                    ","date":"December 31, 1969","contentLength":182}},{"pageContent":"Did you know that 95 percent of the world's food comes from the soil? When viewed in the light of a projected 9 billion mouths to feed by 2050—and the need to produce 70 to 100 percent more food than we do today to meet that demand—preserving soils is unarguably crucial. World Soil Day is an annual day of recognition that takes place Dec. 5th. It has positioned soils front and centre as a major resource in the quest for global sustainability. The effort in highlighting the importance of soil received an added boost when 2015 was designated the International Year of Soils. At Alltech Crop Science we want you to join us in celebrating World Soil Day by sharing some interesting facts. Did you know? Soil is the basis for food, feed, fuel and fibre production. It is the reservoir for at least a quarter of global biodiversity and therefore requires the same attention as above-ground biodiversity. Healthy soil is fundamental to food security and nutrition. Approximately 95 percent of our food comes from our soil. Soil is teeming with life – soils host a quarter of our plants' biodiversity. More than one third of our food goes to waste – and up to half of our households waste could be composted to help create new soil. 11ha of soils are sealed under expanding cities every hour in Europe. Healthy soils play a key role in the supply of clean water and resilience to floods and droughts. Want to know more about soil and what it comprises of?

Modern farms have computer-controlled systems that are adjusted automatically to optimize the environment depending on the stage of growth or reproduction, based on ideal temperature curves established from research and models. For example, for growing pigs, temperature needs to decrease by set amounts as they increase in body weight. However, it is important to ensure the correct growth curve is selected in any automated system to account for breed, age and health of the animals. When animals have been moved to new housing, perhaps following weaning, it may take several days for them to adjust to their surroundings and the new supply of water and feed, and feed intake may drop during this time. The environmental temperature will need to be held at a higher level, compared to their weaning shed, until they have adapted suitably and resumed consumption and growth. Therefore, although computer-controlled systems are very useful, management by personnel and suitable reactions regarding changes in the regulation of temperature are still key to ensuring the growth and health of the pigs. Relative humidity Relative humidity (RH) is defined as the ratio of air-water vapor at a specific temperature compared to the maximum amount of water vapour the air could hold, expressed as a percentage. Under normal, ambient temperatures, pigs can tolerate wide ranges of RH, although RH is still used to assess air quality in housing, and RH should be maintained between 60 percent and 90 percent. Nasal mucosa can be severely reduced in very dry housing conditions (low RH), leading to an increased risk of developing health problems from airborne pathogens, particularly those of the respiratory tract. Conversely, in wet conditions with higher RH, pathogens present in water droplets increase exposure to disease. For nursery pigs, high RH can be a problem when the ambient air temperature is low, as automated ventilation systems reduce the amount of fresh air circulating within the house, allowing RH to increase to problematic levels. Under these conditions, an increase in respiratory disease can occur, which may affect the health and growth of the pigs. Intervention by management personnel is required under these conditions to ensure ventilation rates are maintained. Additional space heaters can be used to get the house up to temperature before moving the piglets. In modern housing systems, both temperature and RH can be controlled automatically via sensors. However, care is needed with these, as they can become damaged during clean out and power washing. Their accuracy should be verified on a regular basis using handheld and empirical devices.","metadata":{"source":"https://www.alltech.com/blog/pig-ease-using-environmental-control-help-pigs-adapt-and-grow","title":"\n\n                    Pig-ease: Using environmental control to help pigs adapt and grow\n                    ","date":"October 30, 2017","contentLength":435}}]
